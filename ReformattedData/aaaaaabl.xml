This thesis aims to provide new insights to this debate by studying the welfare effects of different types of trade agreements and the equilibrium outcome(s) of trade negotiation. We apply the three-country and three-good &#8220;competing-exporters model" developed by Bagwell and Staiger (1999) as our basic trade framework. By comparing the equilibrium welfare of each country under different structures of trading blocs, we clarify the welfare impacts of each trade agreement. Then we model the process of trade negotiation as a trade negotiation game, in which each country endogenously decides whether to negotiate through multilateral or bilateral trade liberalisation. By solving the equilibrium of the game, the stable structure of trading blocs and the path(s) to reach it can be found. We start with a framework in which all countries are welfare maximising. We find that at the early stage of trade negotiation, a free trade agreement (FTA) is Pareto welfare improving, despite the fact that member countries benefit more than any non-member. Although being the hub is the best position, a spoke is in a worse position than being outside a single FTA. Thus, a &#8220;hub-and-spoke" structure cannot be achieved and the unique equilibrium outcome of trade negotiation is given by multilateral free trade (MFT) through a multilateral trade agreement (MTA). The welfare-maximising analysis is followed by the examination of cases in which each government is politically motivated. The political structure we use is similar to Ornelas (2005), which follows the basic framework developed by Grossman and Helpman (1995), emphasising the interaction between lobby groups representing the special interest of one industry and the government in their home country. We first consider a circumstance where the political pressures are only from the import- competing sector. It is then generalised to a case in which all sectors are allowed to lobby the local government. Furthermore, the analysis is extended into an asymmetric world that includes two big countries and one small country. Our results show that political economy forces usually reduce the likelihood of forming trade agreements and that when the political concerns are sufficiently large, all trade agreements can be prevented by political pressures. Also, our findings suggest that the option of bilateral FTAs does not cause an initially infeasible MFT to become feasible, while a previously feasible MFT is likely to be blocked by the option of FTAs. Thus, our thesis provides some evidence to support the argument that the formation of FTAs can be a &#8220;stumbling block" for global trade liberalisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilateral trade agreements; multilateral trade liberalisation; political economy</field><field name="subject">International trade.</field><field name="subject">Foreign trade regulation.</field><field name="subject">Commercial treaties.</field><field name="subject">Tariff Law and legislation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53217</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loop groups, Higgs fields and generalised string classes.</field><field name="creator">Vozzo, Raymond</field><field name="description">We consider various generalisations of the string class of a loop group bundle. The string class is the obstruction to lifting a bundle whose structure group is the loop group LG to one whose structure group is the Kac-Moody central extension of the loop group. We develop a notion of higher string classes for bundles whose structure group is the group of based loops, &#937;G. In particular, we give a formula for characteristic classes in odd dimensions for such bundles which are associated to characteristic classes for G-bundles in the same way that the string class is related to the first Pontrjagyn class of a certain G-bundle associated to the loop group bundle in question. This provides us with a theory of characteristic classes for &#937;G-bundles analogous to Chern-Weil theory in finite dimensions. This also gives us a geometric interpretation of the well-known transgression map H[superscript]2k (BG) &#8594; H[superscript]2k&#8722;1 (G).

This thesis aims to show how narrative in general, and in particular in the novels of French Lebanese writer, Amin Maalouf, plays a crucial role in the transmission of collective memory. The thesis demonstrates that narrative fulfills this function in three ways. Firstly, narrative gives meaning to past events. Secondly, narrative changes and evolves over time. Lastly, narrative ensures a continual exchange between individual and collective memory. Thus, in its capacity to sustain aspects of individual and collective memory, narrative expresses the values that unite society. Central to our analysis of narrative in the work of Amin Maalouf is the concept of "l'autre c&#244;t&#233;" or "the other side". This is the expression used by Maalouf when referring to his passion for forgotten or uncomfortable aspects of Western and Arab cultural heritage. By informing the contemporary reader of the shared past, Maalouf strives to build bridges of understanding between the two groups. Maalouf's novels explore themes of origins, of exile and of memory. In the three novels we examine, the narrative is centered on the life of the hero who, endowed with exceptional qualities, is tested by the political and religious challenges of his time. The personal qualities of the hero, revealed in his dealings with the crises which form the particularity of his time, determine the orientation of collective memory. The first novel, L&#233;on l'Africain, published in 1986, is based on the life of Hassan al-Wazzan who lived in Spain, Africa and Rome in the early sixteenth century. Hassan tells the story of his family, and of the political circumstances which led to the expulsion of the Arabs from Spain. The second novel, Les Jardins de lumi&#232;re, published in 1991, examines the life of the poet, doctor and philosopher named Mani who lived in the third century A.D. In the Epilogue of the novel, the narrator states his intention of challenging the misconceptions and distortions concerning the life of Mani. In the third novel, Le Rocher de Tanios, published in 1993, the narrator sets out to find the truth concerning the events surrounding the birth, life and disappearance of the young man named Tanios, who lived in the narrator's village in Lebanon at the beginning of the nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social memory; francophone; literature; identity; history and fiction; narrative stucture</field><field name="subject">Maalouf, Amin Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53219</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal variation in primary and secondary productivity in the Eastern Great Australian Bight.</field><field name="creator">Van Ruth, Paul David</field><field name="description">The Great Australian Bight (GAB) was for many years thought to be an area of limited biological productivity due to a perceived lack of nutrient enrichment processes. These conclusions, however, were based on data from few studies in the western GAB which were assumed to reflect conditions throughout the entire GAB. More recent studies have reported the occurrence of coastal upwelling in the eastern GAB (EGAB) during summer/autumn (November-April), characterized by low sea surface temperatures and elevated concentrations of chlorophyll &#945;, which suggests that certain areas of the GAB may be highly productive during certain times of the year. The eastern Great Australian Bight (EGAB) forms part of the Southern and Indian Oceans and is an area of high ecological and economic importance. Although it supports the largest fishery in Australia (the South Australian Sardine fishery, annual catches since 2004 ~ 25,000 to 42,500 t), quantitative estimates of the primary productivity underlying this industry are open to debate. Estimates range from &lt; 100 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185; to &gt; 500 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;. Part of this variation may be due to the unique upwelling circulation of shelf waters in summer/autumn (November-April), which shares some similarities with highly productive eastern boundary current upwelling systems, but differs due to the influence of a northern boundary current, the Flinders current, and a wide continental shelf. Shelf waters encompass an area of ~115,000 km&#178;, and the diverse coastal topography forms part of one of the longest stretches of southward facing coastline in the world. In summer-autumn, winds are upwelling favourable, and the Flinders current running along the continental slope causes the upwelling of the deep permanent thermocline from around 600 m depth (dynamic uplift), allowing nutrient rich cold water to entrain onto the shelf. In winterspring, the EGAB is dominated by westerly downwelling-favourable winds, and upwelling via the Flinders current is suppressed. Thus, the area is highly dynamic, with significant spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and oceanography which may drive variations in nutrient enrichment and productivity. This study represents the first intensive investigation of the primary and secondary productivity of the EGAB, and was designed to evaluate the general hypothesis that spatial and temporal variations in meteorology and oceanography in the EGAB will drive spatial and temporal variations in phytoplankton size structure, and primary and secondary productivity. It examines variations in primary and secondary productivity in the EGAB during the upwelling and downwelling seasons of 2004, and the upwelling seasons of 2005 and 2006. Daily integral productivity calculated using the vertically generalised production model (VGPM) showed a high degree of spatial variation. Productivity was low (&lt;800 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;) in offshore central and western regions of the EGAB. High productivities (1600-3900 mg C m&#8315;&#178; day&#8315;&#185;) were restricted to hotspots in the east that were influenced by the upwelled water mass. There was a strong correlation between the depth of the euphotic zone and the depth of the mixed layer that suggested that ~50% of the euphotic zone lay below the mixed layer depth. As a result, high rates of primary productivity did not require upwelled water to reach the surface. A significant proportion of total productivity in the euphotic zone (57% in 2005 and 65% in 2006) occurred in the upwelled water mass below the surface mixed layer. This result has implications for daily integral productivities modelled with the VGPM, which uses surface measures of phytoplankton biomass to calculate productivity. Macro nutrient concentrations could not be used to explain the difference in the low and high productivities (silica &gt;1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, nitrate/nitrite &gt;0.4 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, phosphate &gt;0.1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;). Mixing patterns or micro-nutrient concentrations are possible explanations for spatial variations in primary productivity in the EGAB. On a global scale, daily rates of primary productivity of the EGAB lie between the highly productive eastern boundary current upwelling systems, and less productive coastal regions of western and south eastern Australia, and the oligotrophic ocean. However, daily productivity rates in the upwelling hotspots of the EGAB rival productivities in Benguela and Humbolt currents. Temporal variation in mixing and primary productivity was examined in upwelling influenced nearshore waters off south western Eyre Peninsula (SWEP) in the EGAB. Mixing/stratification in the region was highly temporally variable due to the unique upwelling circulation in summer/autumn, and downwelling through winter/spring. Highest productivity was associated with pwelled/stratified water (up to 2958 mg C m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;), with low productivity during periods of downwelling and mixing (~300-550 mg C m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;), yet no major variations in macro-nutrient concentrations were detected between upwelling and downwelling events (silica &gt;1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, nitrate/nitrite &gt;0.4 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;, phosphate &gt;0.1 &#956;mol L&#8315;&#185;). We hypothesise that upwelling enriches the region with micro-nutrients. High productivity off SWEP appears to be driven by a shallowing of mixed layer depth due to the injection of upwelled waters above Z[subscript]cr. Low productivity follows the suppression of enrichment during downwelling/mixing events, and is exacerbated in winter/spring by low irradiances and short daylengths. Phytoplankton abundance and community composition was also examined in the shelf waters of the EGAB. Phytoplankton abundances were generally higher in near shore waters compared with offshore waters, and during the summer/autumn upwelling season compared with the winter/spring downwelling season. Three distinctly different phytoplankton communities were present in the region during the upwelling and downwelling seasons of 2004, and the upwelling season of 2005, with distinctions manifest in variations in the abundance of dominant types of phytoplankton, and differences in average cell sizes. In summer/autumn, waters influenced by upwelling were characterised by high phytoplankton abundances (particularly diatoms) and larger average cell sizes, while the warmer high-nutrientlow- chlorophyll (HNLC) waters in the region had lower phytoplankton abundances and smaller average cell sizes. The winter/spring community was made up of low abundances of relatively large cells. Diatoms always dominated, but evidence of Si limitation of further diatom growth suggests there may be an upper limit to diatom productivity in the region. The maximum observed diatom concentration of ~164,000 cells L&#8315;&#185; occurred in February/March 2004, in an area influenced by the upwelled water mass. Variations in phytoplankton biodiversity in the shelf waters of southern Australia appear to be related to variations in the influence of upwelling in the region. Meso-zooplankton abundance and community composition was examined in the coastal upwelling system of the EGAB. Spatial and temporal variations were influenced by variations in primary productivity and phytoplankton abundance and community composition, which were driven by variations in the influence of upwelling in the region. Peak meso-zooplankton abundances and biomass occurred in the highly productive upwelling influenced nearshore waters of the EGAB. However, abundances were highly variable between regions and years, reflecting the high spatial and temporal variations in primary productivity and phytoplankton abundance that characterise the shelf waters of the region. Spatial and temporal variations in community composition were driven by changes in the abundance of classes of meso zooplankton common to all regions in both years of this study. Meroplanktonic larvae and opportunistic colonizers dominated the community through the upwelling season, in response to increased primary productivity and phytoplankton blooms. Differences in community composition between upwelling influenced waters and the more HNLC regions appear to be reflected in the relative abundances of cladocera and appendicularia, with cladocera more abundant in productive upwelling influenced areas, and appendicularia thriving in the more HNLC regions of the EGAB. Highest potential grazing rates in the EGAB occurred in nearshore regions with highest mesozooplankton biomass, most likely in response to the high phytoplankton biomass that occurs in the same regions. Peak meso-zooplankton grazing rates in the EGAB were ~80% less than those measured in south west Spencer Gulf in March 2007, and ~35% greater than grazing rates in the Huon Estuary in February 2005. Productivity in the EGAB shows significant spatial and temporal variation, with changes reflecting regional and seasonal variation in meteorology and oceanography, and the water masses present in the region. The overall productivity of a summer/autumn upwelling season was highly dependent on within-season variations in wind strength and direction, which dictate the number, intensity, and duration of upwelling events. Rates of primary productivity measured in the EGAB at a given time depended on the meteorological and oceanographic conditions in the region in the lead up to, and during, the sampling event. We hypothesise that during upwelling events, high productivity in the EGAB is driven by the enrichment of waters above Z[subscript]cr, but below the surface mixed layer, with micro-nutrients. Low productivity within summer/autumn upwelling seasons follows the suppression of this enrichment during downwelling/mixing events, and the overall productivity of the upwelling season will depend on the number, duration and intensity of these downwelling/mixing events. Low productivity during winter/spring is driven by the absence of upwelling, low irradiances and short daylengths.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">primary productivity; coastal upwelling; secondary productivity; mixing; critical depth; phytoplankton; meso-zooplankton</field><field name="subject">Marine plankton Great Australian Bight (W.A. and S.

Numerous stories have been written about African Americans living in slums, struggling to survive, but few are told from the point of view of a white man who endured the traumas of the ghetto while trying to assist them. The Major Work explores what motivated Bill Hennick to risk his life in caring for the poorest of the poor in a city with one of the world&#8217;s highest crime rates. What did he think as he witnessed the devastation of Baltimore as upwardly mobile whites and blacks abandoned the &#8216;wasteland&#8217; and headed for the suburbs? Why did he remain with the underdogs? How did he learn about ghetto culture? How did he win the trust of people in the community who were otherwise suspicious of Caucasians? How did the environment affect him and how did he cope with tragedy? The Major Work also considers whether Bill Hennick survived unscathed. In representing his encounters with an underclass in Baltimore, Ghetto Medic offers a microcosm of race relations and poverty in the United States. It raises questions about the development of the African American ghetto while considering the problem of racial stereotypes, exploring historical influences and offering insight into the chasm that still exists between black and white people. While Bill Hennick bandaged gunshot wounds, gave mouth to mouth resuscitation and assisted in birthing the babies of people who were ignored by the wider community, he tried all the while to provide a stable life for his family, sheltering us from the dangers of his job with his sense of humour. His life as a ghetto medic stands in stark contrast to suburban family life. He began his career wanting to make a difference. But did the ghetto change him? In my exegesis accompanying Ghetto Medic, I have tried to demonstrate how creative nonfiction can be used as a powerful medium in initiating social change and building a bridge between races. The genre liberated me from the constraints of traditional nonfiction while allowing me to preserve factual and historical integrity in the overall work. Because I was attempting to tell someone else&#8217;s story from his point of view, it became necessary and inevitable to understand my responsibilities, roles and rights as a creative nonfiction writer. The exegesis considers the evolution of Ghetto Medic from a dictated autobiography, based on a series of transcribed interviews interspersed with Baltimore&#8217;s history, to a &#8216;biographical memoir&#8217;, including my personal recollections of my father. In this process I became both listener and storyteller. My exegesis describes my experimentation with different points of view, analyses the collaborative process between subject and author and considers the relationship between assumed objectivity and &#8216;truth&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; nonfiction; memoir; biography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53293</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the effects of soil variability and vegetation on the stability of natural slopes.</field><field name="creator">Chok, Yun Hang</field><field name="description">It is well recognised that the inherent soil variability and the effect of vegetation, in particular the effect of tree root reinforcement, have a significant effect on the stability of a natural slope. However, in practice, these factors are not commonly considered in routine slope stability analysis. This is due mainly to the fact that the effects of soil variability and vegetation are complex and difficult to quantify. Furthermore, the available slope stability analysis computer programs used in practice, which adopt conventional limit equilibrium methods, are unable to consider these factors. To predict the stability of a natural slope more accurately, especially the marginally stable one, the effects of soil variability and vegetation needs to be taken into account. The research presented in this thesis focuses on investigating and quantifying the effects of soil variability and vegetation on the stability of natural slopes. The random finite element method (RFEM), developed by Griffiths and Fenton (2004), is adopted to model the effect of soil variability on slope stability. The soil variability is quantified by the parameters called the coefficient of variation (COV) and scale of fluctuation (SOF), while the safety of a slope is assessed using probability of failure. In this research, extensive parametric studies are conducted, using the RFEM, to investigate the influence of COV and SOF on the probability of failure of a cohesive slope (i.e. undrained clay slope) with different geometries. Probabilistic stability charts are then developed using the results obtained from the parametric studies. These charts can be used for a preliminary assessment of the probability of failure of a spatially random cohesive slope. In addition, the effect of soil variability on c'&#8211;&#981;' slopes is also studied. The available RFEM computer program (i.e. rslope2d) is limited to analysing slopes with single-layered soil profile. Therefore, in this research, this computer program is modified to analyse slopes with two-layered soil profiles. The modified program is then used to investigate the effect of soil variability on two-layered spatially random cohesive slopes. It has been demonstrated that the spatial variability of soil variability has a significant effect on the reliability of both single and two-layered soil slopes. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are a powerful data-mapping tool for determining the relationship between a set of input and output variables, are used in an attempt to predict the probability of failure of a spatially random cohesive slope. The aim is to provide an alternative tool to the RFEM and the developed probabilistic stability charts because the RFEM analyses are computationally intensive and time consuming. The results obtained from the parametric studies of a spatially random cohesive slope are used as the database for the ANN model development. It has been demonstrated that the ANN models developed in this research are capable of predicting the probability of failure of a spatially random cohesive slope with high accuracy. The developed ANN models are then transformed into relatively simple formulae for direct application in practice. The effect of root reinforcement caused by vegetation is modelled as additional cohesion to the soils, known as root cohesion, cr. The areas affected by tree roots (i.e. root zone) are incorporated in the finite element slope stability model. The extent of the root zone is defined by the depth of root zone, hr. Parametric studies are conducted and the results are used to develop a set of stability charts that can be used to assess the contribution of root reinforcement on slope stability. Furthermore, ANN models and formulae are also developed based on the results obtained from the parametric studies. It has been demonstrated that the factor of safety of a slope increase linearly with the values cr and hr, and the contribution of root reinforcement to a marginally stable slope is significant. In addition, probabilistic slope stability analysis considering both the variability of the soils and root cohesion are conducted using the modified RFEM computer program. It has been demonstrated that the spatial variability of root cohesion has a significant effect on the probability of slope failure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil variability; Vegetation; Root reinforcement; Slope stability; Probabilistic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54967</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemotherapy-induced mucositis : the role of gastrointestinal microflora and mucins in the luminal environment.</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Andrea M.</field><field name="description">Mucositis manifesting as diarrhoea is a common side effect of chemotherapy which remains poorly understood. It is one of a number of manifestations of alimentary mucositis, which affects the entire gastrointestinal tract. The exact number of patients that are affected by diarrhoea as a result of treatment is uncertain, although it is believed that approximately 10% of patients with advanced cancer will be afflicted. Despite advances in the understanding of oral and small intestinal mucositis over recent years, large intestinal mucositis, including diarrhoea, has not been well defined and the underlying mechanisms of the condition are yet to be established. The majority of the literature available concerning diarrhoea is based on clinical observations, with very little basic research existing. However, from the research conducted, it is likely that the intestinal microflora and mucins play a role in the development of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea. This thesis will examine in detail what is known about the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea (CID). Furthermore it will explore the potentially important relationship between intestinal microflora, the luminal environment and the subsequent development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and diarrhoea. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a commonly used chemotherapy agent in clinical oncology practice. Two of its major side effects are mucositis and diarrhoea. The structure of mucins offers mucosal protection, and allows maintenance of intestinal flora by providing attachment sites and preventing bacterial overgrowth and/or penetration. Following treatment with 5-FU, we showed decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp., and an increase in Escherichia spp. in the jejunum. In the colon, 5-FU caused decreases in Enterococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus spp. Real time PCR of faecal samples showed decreasing trends in Lactobacillus spp. and Bacteroides spp., and an increasing trend in E. coli. Significant increases (p&lt;0.05) were seen in Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus spp. at 24 h. Goblet cell numbers decreased significantly in the jejunum from 24-72 h, with a significant increase in the percentage of cavitated goblet cells, suggesting 5-FU treatment causes significant changes in intestinal flora and mucin secretion in rats. These changes could result in systemic effects, and in particular may contribute to the development of chemotherapy-induced mucositis.  Irinotecan causes cholinergic and delayed onset diarrhoea in patients, in which &#946;-glucuronidase produced by gut bacteria is thought to be involved. Diarrhoea was observed in treated rats, as expected, following irinotecan treatment. &#946;-glucuronidase expression increased in the jejunum and colon. Faecal flora changed quantitatively after treatment also, with increases in E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., and Clostridium spp. (all &#946;-glucuronidase producing), and decreases in Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. (both beneficial bacteria), and Bacteroides spp. (&#946;-glucuronidase producing, major component of intestinal flora), suggesting that irinotecan-induced diarrhoea may be caused by an increase in &#946;-glucuronidase producing bacteria. However, the increase in bacteria may also be caused by irinotecan, further exaggerating the toxicity of the drug, and emphasising the need for these specific bacteria to be therapeutically targeted for successful treatment regimens to be accomplished.  Mucus production appears to be increased after irinotecan treatment, which may contribute to the development of diarrhoea. Goblet cells were demonstrated to decrease significantly after irinotecan treatment. However, mucin secretion increased. Mucin expression changed significantly after treatment. Muc2 and Muc4 decreased significantly in the villi of the jejunum after treatment, Muc2 and Muc4 decreased significantly in the crypts. Muc2 decreased significantly in the colon. This indicates that irinotecan causes an increase in mucin secretion and a net decrease in mucin-producing goblet cells, and the expression of Muc2 and Muc4 in the gastrointestinal tract is altered following treatment. Increased mucin secretion is likely to be related to altered mucin expression, and may contribute to chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea.  To determine if the changes to the intestinal microflora caused by chemotherapy could be translated to the clinic, a pilot clinical study was carried out. Sixteen patients experiencing CID were recruited to the study with two control subjects. A large proportion of patients (75%) demonstrated a reduced anaerobic component of their faecal microflora. A reduced diversity of species was also observed in patients. The majority of patients exhibited decreases in Clostridium spp., Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., whilst all patients exhibited decreases in Bacteroides spp. and Enterococcus spp. Patients receiving antibiotics did not exhibit any marked differences to patients not receiving antibiotics. This indicates that the results observed in the animal studies are clinically relevant, and further research into this area should be undertaken. CID is associated with marked changes in the intestinal microflora. These changes may result in diminished bacterial functions within the gut, altering gut function and initiating intestinal damage, resulting in the onset of diarrhoea.  In conclusion, there is clear evidence demonstrating chemotherapy treatment results in changes to the intestinal microflora and mucin secretion, which may be responsible in part for the development of severe mucositis and diarrhoea. Irinotecan toxicity may be compounded by the increase in &#946;-glucuronidase producing bacteria. The intestinal flora of cancer patients experiencing CID is also noticeably different to that of healthy subjects. Irinotecan causes changes to mucin secretion, and the specific expression of Muc2, Muc4 and Klf4, suggesting that secretory control by the enteric nervous system may also be affected by chemotherapy. This research has extended the understanding of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and diarrhoea, complex side effects of chemotherapy. However, new areas for future research have also been identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mucositis; Microflora; Intestine; Mucin; Toxicity</field><field name="subject">Cancer Treatment Complications</field><field name="subject">Drugs Side effects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54968</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and functional analysis of a geminiviral DNA &#946; satellite encoded gene.</field><field name="creator">Eini Gandomani, Omid</field><field name="description">Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are characterized structurally by twinned (geminate) morphology of virions (ca. 18-30 nm) and genetically by a genome comprising one or two small circular single stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules and they are responsible for major crop losses worldwide. The genus Begomovirus (type member Bean golden yellow mosaic virus) is the largest genus of the family Geminiviridae. The members of this genus have either monopartite or bipartite genomes. They are transmitted by whiteflies and infect only dicotyledonous plants. DNA &#946; molecules are symptom modulating single-stranded sat-DNA molecules which are associated with certain monopartite begomoviruses. These molecules are around half the size (approximately 1350 nt in length) of their helper viruses and rely on the helper begomovirus for movement in plant tissues, replication and plant-to-plant transmission by the whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). They contribute to production of symptoms and enhance helper virus accumulation in certain hosts. DNA &#946; molecules encode a single gene, called &#946;C1, on the complementary strand which is important for pathogenicity and suppression of post transcriptional gene silencing. In this study the regulation of &#946;C1 gene expression, a host factor interacting with &#946;C1 and its role in the pathogenicity of DNA &#946; are described. Transient expression studies using Nicotiana tabacum plants and GUS as a reporter gene, identified the sequences important for transcription of &#946;C1 from DNA &#946; associated with Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV). A 68 nt fragment (between -139 to -207), which contains a G-box motif was sufficient for DNA &#946; promoter activity. Deletion of this region also led to loss of DNA &#946; replication capacity. Mutation of the G-box, located at 143 nucleotides upstream of the &#946;C1 start codon, resulted in a two to three times reduction in the DNA &#946; promoter activity. This motif was shown to bind specifically to the nuclear factors isolated from tobacco leaf tissues. Histochemical staining of transgenic tobacco plants expressing the gus gene driven by full length DNA &#946; promoter showed phloem specific localisation patterns. It was concluded that a G-box motif is required for binding of host nuclear factors and is necessary for efficient expression of this phloem specific &#946;C1 gene. An ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, called SlUBC, was retrieved from screening of a tomato cDNA library, using &#946;C1 encoded by DNA &#946; associated with CLCuMV as the bait. The SlUBC was shown to complement yeast deficient in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. It is thought that this enzyme is a key factor in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which plays a central role in many eukaryotic cellular processes. The authenticity and specificity of this interaction was confirmed both in vivo, using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay, and in vitro. Domain mapping of &#946;C1 showed that a myristoylation-like motif is required for the interaction with SlUBC in the yeast system and induction of DNA &#946; specific symptoms in host plants. Western blot analysis showed that expression of &#946;C1 in transgenic tobacco plants decreased the level of poly-ubiquitinated proteins as compared with wild type plants. However, the level of expression of homologous SlUBC remained stable in these transgenic plants. These results indicated that interaction of &#946;C1 with the SlUBC is required for DNA &#946; specific symptom induction possibly through down-regulation of the host ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Using GFP transgenic N. benthamiana plants, the &#946;C1 encoded by DNA &#946; associated with CLCuMV showed suppression of post transcriptional gene silencing. This protein inhibited both local and systemic silencing. However, the low level of GFP fluorescence and also the results of RNA analysis in patch co-infiltration assay indicated that &#946;C1 is a weak suppressor of local RNA silencing as compared with P19 protein from Tomato bushy stunt virus. A three-way grafting assay and separate patch infiltration assays showed that &#946;C1 interferes with the activity of GFP silencing signal. Mutation of Gly103 in &#946;C1 which was shown to be required for interaction with SlUBC and induction of DNA &#946; specific symptoms in host plants, had no effect on the silencing suppression activity of &#946;C1 protein. This work has provided a new insight into the importance of a G-box motif in expression of &#946;C1 gene of DNA &#946; and also for binding to the host nuclear proteins. In addition, interaction with a host factor, SlUBC, has been shown to be required for induction of DNA &#946; specific symptoms in experimental plants using ToLCV as a helper virus. However, this interaction was not required for silencing suppression activity of &#946;C1. The results of this study can be adapted to determine the mode of pathogenesis and regulation of expression of &#946;C1 in cotton leaf curl disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant virus; geminivirus; satellite DNA; promoter; protein-protein interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55293</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the relationship between fowlpox virus and the mammalian immune system.</field><field name="creator">Beukema, Emma Louise</field><field name="description">Fowlpox viruses (FPV) are attractive platform vaccine vector candidates because their capacity for insertion of multiple heterologous genes makes them favourable for genetic modification. They also have strong adjuvant activity in their own right. As FPV does not replicate in mammalian cells, there is significantly less opposition associated with their clinical application, with a number already in use. However, a thorough understanding of the immunological relationship between FPV and the mammalian immune system is still lacking. The aim of this thesis was to construct a series of recombinant FPV vectors that co-expressed the nominal antigen chicken ovalbumin (OVA), (FPV[subscript]OVA), and/or murine interleukin-4 (mIL-4). These constructs were used for the characterisation of the relationship between FPV and the mammalian immune system and how this is altered by the co-expression of mIL-4. Immunisation with FPV[subscript]OVA resulted in rapid and highly localized OVA expression which induced strong CD8&#8314; cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity but only weak CD4&#8314; T helper and antibody responses. In addition, presentation of FPV-derived antigen and the priming of antigen-specific CTL responses required a permissive bone marrow (BM)-derived cell as the antigen presenting cell (APC). Co-administration with FPV[subscript]mIL-4 resulted in a dramatic reduction in CTL activity that remained largely non-functional throughout the infection and a skewing of the T helper (Th) response towards Th2 with a reduction in interferon (IFN)-&#947; production by OVA-specific Th cells. These findings provide a sound basis for further characterization of how FPV interacts with the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, how these can be manipulated via the co-administration of cytokines, and discovering if future rationally designed modifications result in FPV vectored vaccines that induce durable cellular and humoral immunity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fowlpx virus; immune system; vaccine vector</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/55405</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intercultural analysis of Indonesian and Australian students&#8217; nonverbal behaviour: an effort to develop intercultural English learning material.</field><field name="creator">Mokoginta, Karmila</field><field name="description">This study investigates similar and different nonverbal behaviours of Indonesian and Australian students (focusing on proxemics, kinesics, touching and dress codes), examines the students' perception in relation to the behaviours, and isolates or predicts intercultural problems. It aims at creating learning resources to be used in English classes in Indonesia. The data collection involved observations and interviews. Initial data analysis was conducted at the same time as the data collection, followed by an intensive analysis using a coding process. Some similarities were found. There was a tendency among Indonesian students to sit together, reflecting their collectivist value. This tendency may also be evident among Australian students. Similar patterns of eye gazing, hand movements, sitting posture, body position and body orientation probably demonstrate the universality of communicative behaviour. In both cultures, head nodding indicates paying attention, or in certain situations, may be interpreted as a flattering gesture. However, the flattering meaning may result from a different degree of head nodding display in Indonesian and Australian contexts. Many of these similar behaviours need further investigation using video recording. Many differences were found. In tutorials, Indonesians were more likely to be formal and restrained, in contrast to Australian informality and expressiveness. Different practices in the use of the hand were also identified. Dress code was one of the most significant areas of difference, together with the public display of affective behaviour, and the preference to sit on the floor or to sit and lie on the lawns. Eye contact, gender-mixing in gatherings and some touching behaviours may be problematic for a few Indonesians. Further discussion also shows that smiling to strangers commonly practised by Australians can be unusual in Indonesia. In contrast, head nodding, eye contact and head tossing that have specific cultural meanings in Indonesia appear to be unproblematic in the Australian context. It was concluded that the different behaviours indicate that several issues &#8211; including conflict avoidance, face saving, respect for authority, harmony maintenance, ingroup-outgroup divisions and religious regulations &#8211; are practiced in different ways and valued to differing degrees in Indonesia and Australia. The analysis also revealed a strong indication that in Indonesian culture, nonverbal behaviour has similar emphasis with, and often can be more significant than, verbal behaviour. In Australia, the emphasis would be more likely to be on verbal expression. It seems that some of the differences did not result in negative perception among students. However, certain things may result in problems at various levels - ranging from uncomfortable feelings, and lack of interactions, up to the formation of negative perception about a culture. Having tolerance and willingness to evaluate a matter from different perspectives can be useful to minimize ethnocentrism and avoid any negative stereotypes. As part of this study I conducted a literature review about intercultural learning and created two examples of learning material, both focusing on nonverbal behaviours. The first material is intended to raise the issue of cultural difference, and the second one raises the ethnocentrism issue.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intercultural; Indonesia; Australia; nonverbal behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56026</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genes for sodium exclusion in wheat.</field><field name="creator">Byrt, Caitlin Siobhan</field><field name="description">Salinity stress limits the growth and productivity of agricultural crops in many regions of the world. Whole plant tolerance to soil salinity involves numerous processes in many different tissues and cell types. For many cereals, sensitivity to salinity is due to the accumulation of sodium (Na&#8314;) to toxic concentrations in the leaves. This thesis investigates a mechanism of control of Na&#8314; accumulation in leaves of wheat. Bread wheat excludes sodium from the leaves better than durum wheat. Bread wheat is hexaploid (AABBDD) whereas durum wheat is tetraploid (AABB). The D-genome in bread wheat carries a major locus for sodium exclusion, Kna1, which may contribute to the differences in sodium exclusion between bread wheat and durum wheat. An unusual durum wheat, Line 149, excludes sodium to a similar degree as bread wheat. Line 149 was derived from a cross between a Triticum monococcum (accession C68-101; AA) and a durum wheat (T. turgidum ssp. durum cv. Marrocos; AABB). Line 149 had been found to contain two major genes for sodium exclusion, named Nax1 and Nax2, which appeared to retrieve sodium from the xylem sap in the roots and so prevent it reaching the leaves. Line 149 had been crossed with the durum wheat cv. Tamaroi, which accumulates high concentrations of Na&#8314; in the leaves, and near-isogenic single-gene mapping populations had been developed for Nax1 and Nax2. Nax1 had been located on chromosome 2A. The objective of this thesis was to map Nax2 and identify a candidate gene. Nax2 mapped to chromosome 5AL based on linkage to microsatellite markers. A high-affinity potassium (K&#8314;) transporter (HKT)-like gene, HKT1;5 was considered as a candidate gene for Nax2, based on similarity of the phenotype to a rice orthologue. Sequence information from a wheat HKT1;5-like expressed sequence tag in the public database was used to develop a probe for use in Southern hybridsation. A HKT1;5-like fragment was identified in Line 149 and T. monococcum C68-101, but was absent in Tamaroi. The HKT1;5-like gene, named TmHKT1;5-A, co-segregated with Nax2 in the Nax2 single-gene mapping population. The HKT1;5 probe identified three putative HKT1;5-like genes on the long arm of chromosome 4B, and one HKT1;5-like gene on the long arm of chromosome 4D, in Langdon (T. turgidum ssp. durum) substitution lines, and in Chinese Spring (T. aestivum) ditelomeric lines. No A-genome HKT1;5 like gene was identified in Langdon or Chinese Spring. The D-genome HKT1;5 gene, named TaHKT1;5-D, was found to co-locate with Kna1, the gene for sodium exclusion in bread wheat, in Chinese Spring chromosome 4D deletion lines. Nax2 (TmHKT1;5-A) was found to be homoeologous with the gene for sodium exclusion in bread wheat, Kna1 (TaHKT1;5-D). TmHKT1;5-A and TaHKT1;5-D, and their promoters, were 94% identical, and both were expressed in the roots of wheat plants. This is consistent with the genes being located in the stele of the roots and retrieving Na&#8314; from the xylem sap as it flows towards the shoot, and so excluding Na&#8314; from the leaves. A marker for TmHKT1;5-A was developed to track this gene in durum wheat breeding programs. A study of the HKT1;5 gene in diploid ancestors of wheat indicated that this gene is present in most Triticum monococcum accessions, some T. boeoticum accessions, but not present in any T. urartu accessions. T. urartu is the likely A genome ancestor of modern wheat. This may explain the absence of HKT1;5 in the A genome of modern wheat. The protein encoded by TaHKT1;5-D transported sodium when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The inward currents were specific to Na&#8314;, but at particular mole fractions of Na&#8314; and K&#8314; outward currents were observed that were consistent with outward K&#8314; transport. These data were consistent with the putative physiological function, of retrieving Na&#8314; from the xylem sap as it flows to the leaves, and resulting in a net exchange with K&#8314;. A construct designed to silence the expression of TaHKT1;5-D was introduced to bread wheat cv. Bob White. Nineteen putative transgenic plants were developed. The leaf Na&#8314; concentrations and genotype of the T1 individuals were assayed. The data from two of the transgenic plants indicated that TaHKT1;5-D may have been silenced and that this may have lead to the increase in Na&#8314; accumulation in the leaves. However, this data is not conclusive at this time. The information gained from this study will assist the introduction of the Na&#8314; exclusion trait into current durum cultivars, which are poor at excluding Na&#8314; and are salt sensitive. This information will also contribute to the body of knowledge of ion transport in plants and salinity tolerance in wheat.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salt tolerance; wheat; Triticum aestivum; sodium exclusion</field><field name="subject">Wheat Genetics</field><field name="subject">Sodium</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56208</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8217;Source to sink&#8217; sedimentology and petrology of a dryland fluvial system, and implications for reservoir quality, Lake Eyre Basin, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Menacherry, Saju</field><field name="description">Reservoir quality of subsurface sandstones depends on the composition, texture and grain size of the initial sediments. These factors are a function of hinterland processes: tectonic setting, provenance, climate and depositional environment, and sediment transportation processes. This study focuses on a modern, dryland, fluvial deposition system from source-to-sink that aims to provide a quantitative dataset analogue to facilitate forward modelling for prediction of subsurface compositions, grain size and textures of reservoir sandstones. Umbum Creek, in the western Lake Eyre Basin of Central Australia, was selected as a small river network (~ 100km&#178;) in order to study source-to-sink sedimentation. The provenance area was analysed using isopach maps derived from a 783 drill-hole dataset, which included stratigraphy and lithology information. Subsequently forty-three samples of different provenance lithotypes from the Umbum Creek catchment were collected for petrographic thin-section analysis. Recent sediments were then sampled from 90 strategically located stream confluences along Umbum Creek and tributaries (proximal, medial and distal subsets). A quantitative textural and compositional dataset was subsequently generated from 34 selected samples. With half-phi sieve analysis (4mm to 32 microns), and an associated petrographic description recognising 72 categories of grain composition was undertaken for each sample. The provenance analysis using isopach maps demonstrated that Palaeozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary basin evolution in the study area was controlled by northeast and northwest-trending structural elements. The regional uplift of the Peake and Denison Inliers that occurred during the Cenozoic had a significant impact on the evolution of the Lake Eyre Basin, causing changes in the provenance of Late Neogene sedimentation and on through to the present. The sink area represents a shallow intracratonic basin whereby a thin veneer of fluvial/lacustrine sediments is accumulating adjacent to a basement uplift. This study has highlighted the importance of multiple sediment provenances. Five different provenance lithotype grains were identified in the Umbum Creek modern sediments: the Gawler Craton plutonic / basement provenance (recycled) the Peake and Denison Inliers Proterozoic volcanic provenance (recycled), the Davenport Ranges metamorphic provenance, the Mesozoic sedimentary provenance and the Cenozoic sedimentary provenance. Whereas a downstream fining of grain size was expected, a general trend of downstream coarsening of grain size was noted being the result of aeolian deflation of fines and intra-basinal coarse-grained sediment contributions. In the sink area, modern sediments from the terminal splay complex comprise 70-80% quartz, 10-20% lithic fragments (of which ~ 7% are ductile lithic grains), &lt; 3% feldspar, and clay (&lt;2%). Grains are sub-angular to well-rounded and moderately well sorted. The compositional and textural maturity of the terminal splay sediments is attributed to reworked plutonic quartz grains, the dissolution and disintegration of feldspar and carbonate grains during transportation, along with the breakdown of lithic fragments due to fluvio-aeolian interactions and subsequent mechanical/ chemical weathering processes. These data were used to build a predictive forward model for modal sandstone analysis that achieved a fair to good correlation between predicted and observed grain lithotypes and provenance categories. These results illustrate that the character of sands in the Umbum Creek catchment are governed by a multiplicity of controls such as tectonic setting, provenance lithotype analysis, climate, regional topographic gradient, hinterland transport distance, basin subsidence rate and depositional environment. The fluvio-aeolian depositional environment along with the current arid to semi-arid playa climatic conditions of Umbum Creek catchment facilitate the growth of clay coatings, however accounts for a low clay matrix within the deposits. In addition, the playa environment also facilitates the alteration of infiltrated detrital clay to kaolinite, the formation of evaporites (gypsum, halite and anhydrite) and the formation of authigenic clays. These factors are all significant in determining the ultimate reservoir quality of reservoir sandstones, emphasising the importance of this study as an analogue for modelling &#8216;buried&#8217; dryland depositional systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">provenance; lithotype; modelling; lithology; source to sink; mixing effect; meta-sedimentary; diagenesis</field><field name="subject">Sedimentation and deposition South Australia Lake Eyre Basin</field><field name="subject">Water quality South Australia Lake Eyre Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56268</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fate and effects of human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Michael</field><field name="description">There is relatively little known about the fate of human pharmaceuticals once they are released into the aquatic environment and what adverse impacts these compounds have on exposed aquatic organisms. Both of these factors are essential in defining the potential risk pharmaceuticals pose in the aquatic environment. For this project up to 14 human therapeutic agents were selected as representative compounds to assess both their fate and effects within model aquatic systems. Considering sediments often serve as a repository for aquatic contaminants, the interaction of the selected pharmaceuticals with sediment was assessed. The sorption of the selected pharmaceuticals was found to be highly variable. Furthermore, the solution pH and ionic strength, due to Ca2+, were found to exert a large degree of influence on the extent of sorption observed. These solution parameters, among others, may therefore make it difficult to predict the fate of pharmaceuticals, in terms of their association with sediments, using standardised assessment methods alone. There is an extensive pool of knowledge on pharmaceuticals, in terms of their pharmacological profile, so their distribution within the human body (using the volume of distribution or VD) was compared with their distribution within a sediment / water system (using the partition coefficient or Kd). The correlation between the VD and Kd indicated this relationship provided a reasonable basis for estimating the distribution of drugs within the test sediment / water systems. This finding suggests that further exploration of the use of pharmacological data in understanding the potential fate of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems is warranted. The extent of the pharmaceuticals respective desorption values was also found to be highly variable within a standard test system. Further analysis on the desorption of carbamazepine, an anti-epileptic drug, was undertaken using an isotopic dilution technique. Observations from the isotopic dilution study indicated that both contact time with sediment and the quality of organic carbon could play an important role in the potential for sediments to irreversibly sorb carbamazepine present in aquatic systems. The desorption hysteresis observed for the other pharmaceuticals also indicates considerable effort is still required to address the issue of whether sediments can be a means of reducing exposure of pharmaceuticals to aquatic organisms (a &#8220;sink&#8221;) or a means of increasing exposure to sediment-dependent organisms (a &#8220;source&#8221;). The necessity for further work on investigating the role that sorption with sediments may play in the fate and effects of human pharmaceuticals was highlighted by a series of ecotoxicological assays in both sediment and solution-only systems. Sediment-dwelling freshwater midges, Chironomus tepperi, were exposed to carbamazepine in both short- and long-term assays. Wet weight was found to be significantly reduced during short-term assays, while the development of C. tepperi larvae was found to be significantly inhibited when exposed to spiked sediment, over a longer exposure period. For these assays, the aqueous phase may have been a more important route of exposure of carbamazepine for the midges. This study has indicated that sediments are likely to play an important role in the fate of pharmaceuticals and, subsequently, their effects. However, considerably more effort is required to assess the role sediments have and how this knowledge can be linked with current regulatory ecological risk assessments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analytical; ecotoxicology; sorption; pharmacology; distribution; sediment; water</field><field name="subject">Water Pollution Toxicology.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic organisms Effect of drugs on.</field><field name="subject">Drugs Environmental aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56273</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The compositional basis of the aroma of Riesling and unwooded Chardonnay wine.</field><field name="creator">Smyth, Heather Eunice</field><field name="description">The aim of this research project was to explore, in detail, the relationship between volatile composition and wine aroma for two white wine varieties, namely Riesling and unwooded Chardonnay, so that the most influential volatile aroma compounds to the aroma of these two varieties could be identified. Twenty Australian commercial wines of each variety were analysed by quantitative sensory descriptive analysis and targeted for the chemical analysis of more than 45 volatile compounds. The compositional and sensory data sets were related using multivariate methods (e.g. PCA and PLS), and aroma volatiles were identified that related to the specific sensory properties of each variety. Most of the Riesling and several of the unwooded Chardonnay sensory properties were well predicted by the compositional data and several compounds were identified as important to the aroma of each variety. The unwooded Chardonnay wines were higher in concentration of various fermentation- derived compounds than were the Riesling wines, and these volatiles played an important role in the sensory properties of this variety. The Riesling wines were higher in concentration of grape-derived compounds including the monoterpenes, norisoprenoids, and dimethyl sulfide. These compounds, and also many of the fermentation-derived compounds, were identified as important contributors to the aroma of the Riesling wines. The results from this study have greatly advanced our understanding of the complex interactions between volatile compounds and the role that they play in the specific aroma nuances of white wines. The prediction of sensory properties of the Riesling and unwooded Chardonnay wines was investigated using rapid instrumental techniques, namely mass spectrometry based electronic nose (MS Enose) and visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy. A combination of MS Enose and VIS-NIR gave the best predictive results compared to either method alone. Promising results were achieved for many of the sensory properties indicating that this technique shows good potential for application. The so-called 'wine lactone' (3a,4,5,7a- etrahydro-3,6-dimethylbenzofuran-2(3H)-one) is known to be an important white wine odorant. The formation of wine lactone was investigated from two potential precursors, namely (E)-2,6-dimethyl-6-hydroxyocta-2,7- dienoic acid and the glucose ester of this acid, in model wine at room emperature and 45&#8304;C. The hydrolytic results show that the rate of formation of wine lactone is too slow for either the acid or the glucose ester to be major precursors to wine lactone in young white wine. Therefore, different precursors are most likely responsible for the formation of wine lactone in young white wine.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56274</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of leader emotional intelligence in transformational leadership, employee trust, change cynicism and intention to leave.</field><field name="creator">Ferres, Natalie</field><field name="description">Much has been written in the popular media about the importance of emotional intelligence (EI) in determining exceptional leadership. The present research contributes to the academic literature by studying the direct and indirect effects of leader EI on a number of organisational variables. Study 1 was the main focus of the research and progressed in three stages. The first involved the development of a measurement model of an employee survey. Respondents reported on their leaders' EI and transformational leadership (TL), and self reported on their own attitudes and intentions. Drawing on exploratory (n = 218) and confirmatory factor analysis (n = 230) results, an eight dimensional model was supported. The emergent factors consisted of EI-perception, EI-management, TL-inspiring influence, TL-concern/behaviour, change cynicism and intention to leave. Secondly, a structural model of relationships between the emergent factors was examined then compared to alternative models (n = 448). The best-fitting model showed that leader EI was associated with employees' intentions to leave and change cynicism via TL and trust. Significant relationships between both EI variables and each TL factor were evidenced. At both stages, the results were successfully cross-validated in a sample from a different organisation (n = 339) and controlled for dispositional trust levels and geographic location. Third, the structural relationships were shown to hold longitudinally over a twelve months (n = 210). Study 2 aimed to assess the effects of leader EI from an ability perspective by matching leader scores on EI tests with employee survey responses. Total leader scores on the AO-MEIS (n = 102) and MSCEIT V2 (n = 102) were not significantly correlated with employee perceptions of leader EI. Total scores on both EI tests were significantly yet weakly related to transformational leadership ratings. At the total-test level, there were no significant relationships between leader EI and trust in manager, trust in organisation, change cynicism or intention to leave. At the branch level, leader scores on MSCEIT-emotion perception were positively associated with employees' trust in both the manager and organisation. Leader MSCEIT-emotion management scores were also related to lower change cynicism.

The region has experienced a protracted c. 1700 Myr tectonic history from the Archaean through to the Mesoproterozoic, experiencing numerous cycles of deformation, magmatism and basin development. Despite hosting a number of mineral deposits, including the immense Olympic Dam iron oxide-copper-gold deposit, the tectonothermal evolution of the Gawler Craton remains poorly constrained. A significant ambiguity in our current understanding of the geological framework of the Gawler Craton revolves around the timing and spatial distribution of the tectonic events within the craton and their metamorphic evolution. This study addresses some of this ambiguity by unravelling the timing and tectonothermal evolution of the reworked southern Gawler Craton, using a combination of structural and metamorphic analysis, coupled with targeted geochronology. These methods have been applied to three locations representing different lithologies across the southern Gawler Craton. Putting absolute time into structural and metamorphic analysis is a vital tool for unravelling the development of ancient and modern orogenic systems. Electron Probe Micro-Analysis (EPMA) chemical dating of monazite provides a useful method of obtaining good precision age data from monazite bearing assemblages. This technique was developed at the University of Adelaide in order to constrain the timing of reworked assemblages from the southern Gawler Craton. EPMA measurements carried out on samples of known age, from Palaeoproterozoic to Ordovician, produce ages which are within error of the isotopically determined ages, indicating the validity of the developed setup. This technique, together with SHRIMP monazite and titanite and garnet Sm-Nd geochronology, was used on selected samples from the southern Gawler Craton to determine the timing of high-grade metamorphism and deformation. The results show that the Sleaford Complex records evidence of an early D&#8321;event during the c. 2450 Ma Sleaford Orogeny recorded within structural boudins. The majority of the data indicates that the region underwent subsequent reworking and thorough overprinting during the 1725&#8211;1690 Ma Kimban Orogeny. In the Coffin Bay region, Palaeoproterozoic peraluminous granites of the Dutton Suite are reworked by a series of migmatitic and mylonitic shear zones during the Kimban Orogeny. Peak metamorphic conditions recorded in mafic assemblages indicate conditions of 10 kbar at 730&#176;C. The post-peak evolution is constrained by partial to complete replacement of garnet &#8211; clinopyroxene bearing mafic assemblages by hornblende &#8211; plagioclase symplectites, which record conditions of c. 6 kbar at 700&#176;C, implying a steeply decompressional exhumation path. The Shoal Point region consists of a series of reworked granulite-facies metapelitic and metaigneous units which belong to the late Archaean Sleaford Complex. Structural evidence indicates three phases of fabric development with D&#8321;retained within boudins, D&#8322;consisting of a series upright open to isoclinal folds producing an axial planar fabric and D&#8323;, a highly planar vertical high-strain fabric which overprints the D&#8322; fabric. Geochronology constrains the D&#8321; event to the c. 2450 Ma Sleafordian Orogeny while the D&#8322;the D&#8323;events are constrained to the 1730&#8211;1690 Ma Kimban Orogeny. P-T pseudosections constrain the metamorphic conditions for the Sleafordian Orogeny to between 4.5&#8211;6 kbar and 750&#8211;780 &#176;C. Subsequent Kimban-aged reworking reached peak metamorphic conditions of 8&#8211;9 kbar at 820&#8211;850 &#176;C during the D&#8322; event. Followed by near isothermal decompression to metamorphic conditions &lt;6 kbar and 790&#8211;850 &#176;C associated with the development of the D&#8323;high-strain fabric. The Pt Neill and Mine Creek regions are located in the core and on the flank of the crustal scale Kalinjala Shear Zone, which forms the main structural element of the poorly exposed Kimban Orogen. Samples record a similar structural development with a dextrally transpressive system resulting in a layer parallel migmatitic gneissic to mylonitic KS&#8321; fabric which was subsequently deformed and reworked by upright folds and discrete KD&#8322; east-side-down sub-solidus mylonitic shear zones during east-west compression. Geochronology constrains the timing of deformation and metamorphism to the Kimban Orogeny between 1720 and 1700 Ma. Metamorphic P-T analysis and pseudosections constrain the peak M&#8321; conditions in the core of the shear zone to 10&#8211;11 kbar at c. 800 &#176;C reflecting lower crustal conditions at depths of up to 30 km. On the flank of the shear zone the M&#8321; conditions reached 6&#8211;7 kbar at 750 &#176;C followed by sub-solidus reworking during KD&#8322; at conditions of 3&#8211;4 kbar at 600&#8211;660 &#176;C, suggesting a maximum burial of &lt;24 km. Cooling rates suggest that the core of the shear zone cooled at rates in excess of 40&#8211;80 &#176;CMa&#8315;&#185; while the flank underwent much slower cooling at &lt; 10&#176;CMa&#8315;&#185;. The rapid cooling and inferred decompression in the core of the shear zone reflects rapid burial and exhumation of lower-crustal material into the mid-crust along the Kalinjala Shear Zone. The absence of evidence for extension indicates that differential exhumation and the extrusion of lower-crustal material into the mid-crust was driven by transpression along the shear zone and highlights the role of transpression in creating large variations in vertical exhumation over relatively short lateral extents. Garnet is a vital mineral for determining constrained P-T-t paths as it can give both the P-T and t information directly. However, estimates of the closure temperature of the Sm-Nd system in garnet vary considerably leading to significant uncertainties in the timing of peak conditions. Five igneous garnets of varying size from an undeformed 2414 &#177; 6 Ma garnet &#8211; cordierite bearing s-type granite from the Coffin Bay region, that were subjected to high-T reworking during the Kimban Orogeny, have been dated to examine their diffusional behaviour in the Sm-Nd system. Garnets were compositionally profiled and then dated. A direct correlation exists between grain size and amount of resetting highlighting the effect of grain size on closure temperature. Major element and REE traverses reveal homogonous major element profiles and relict igneous REE profiles. The retention of REE zoning and homogenisation of major element zoning suggests that diffusion rates of REE&#8217;s are considerably slower than that of the major cations, in disagreement with recent experimental determinations of the diffusion rates of REE in garnet. The retention of REE zoning and the lack of resetting in the largest grains suggests that Sm-Nd closure temperature in garnet is a function of grain-size, thermal history and REE zoning in garnet. The findings of this study provide the first temporally constrained tectonothermal model of the evolution of the southern Gawler Craton. The P-T conditions obtained from the earliest D&#8321; fabric provide the first quantitative constraints on the P-T conditions of the southern Sleafordian Orogeny. The P-T-t evolution determined for the 1725&#8211;1690 Ma Kimban Orogeny indicate it developed along a clockwise P-T path, and dominates the structural and metamorphic character of the southern Gawler Craton. The large variations in exhumation over short lateral extents reflect the exhumation of lower crustal rocks during the Kimban Orogeny driven by transpression during the development of a regional transpressional &#8216;flower structure&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gawler Craton; reworking; reativation; metamorphic evolution; geochronology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56376</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lucerne performance on duplex soil under Mediterranean climate : field measurement and simulation modelling.</field><field name="creator">Zahid, Muhammad Shafiq</field><field name="description">The experimental work reported in this thesis quantified the productivity of lucerne over a two-year period (2000-2001) for a Mediterranean climate at Roseworthy in South Australia (34&#176;32&#8242;S, 138&#176;45&#8242;E), and determined associated dynamics for water and nitrogen in duplex soil. Shoot growth of dryland lucerne was limited primarily by the pattern and amount of incident rainfall, but high temperature (30-35oC) also constrained summer production. These high summer temperatures induced greater production when irrigation was applied, but under the normally dry summer conditions high temperatures combined with soil water deficit (up to 200mm) caused growth to cease. Thus, shoot dry matter yield under rainfed conditions was 4.9 t ha&#8315;&#185; in 2000 (from 7 harvests) and 1.8 t ha&#8315;&#185; in 2001 (from 5 harvests) whereas summer irrigation increased yield to 14.9 t ha&#8315;&#185; in 2000 (7 harvests) and 7.1 t ha&#8315;&#185; in 2001 (5 harvests). Under rainfed conditions the RUE was 0.55 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PARi compared with 1.08 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; PARi in the irrigated treatment in 2000, reducing to 0.4 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; for the rainfed and 0.7 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; under limited irrigation in 2001. Lucerne plant population declined from 69 to 20 (plants m&#8315;&#178;) in the rainfed treatment and the plants partially compensated for this in 2000 by increasing stem density from 300 to 400 m&#8315;&#178; in 2000 although this declined back to 300 m&#8315;&#178; in 2001. In all treatments more than 70% of root biomass was in the top 40 cm soil, this was partially due to the vertical distribution of plant available water but also to subsoil constraints to root development below 0.6m. Nevertheless, lucerne was able to extract water and nitrate to 1800 mm soil depth. Large amounts of irrigation &gt;400mm) over summer (Dec 1999-Mar 2000) increased total soil water content, approaching the drained upper limit; causing a 600% increase in shoot dry matter yield, similarly higher growth rate (71 kg DM d&#8315;&#185;) and higher RUE (~1.7 g DM MJ&#8315;&#185; ), confirming that water availability was the main constraint to lucerne growth. Delayed benefits of summer irrigation, especially in the subsurface treatment, were also observed later (July to October) when lucerne was able to scavenge excess irrigation water and nitrate stored in the 600-1800 mm soil profile, which resulted in increased shoot growth. Drainage below the effective rooting depth was negligible, even under irrigation, confirming that lucerne can dry soil profiles and reduce deep drainage. Average annual water use efficiency was 9 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185; mm&#8315;&#185; under rainfed conditions compared to ~15 kg DM ha&#8315;&#185; mm&#8315;&#185; under irrigated conditions. Shoot dry mattter production was closely related to evapotranspiration in all treatments, however, under rainfed conditions losses from evaporation were proportionally higher compared to irrigated treatments. Sub-surface drip irrigation proved superior to surface irrigation using 22% less water compared to surface sprinkler irrigation treatment with comparable yields. Biological N&#8322;fixation was strongly related to shoot production with 18 to 27 kg N fixed per tonne of shoot dry matter across all seasons and treatments. Dependence on N&#8322;fixation appeared to be unrelated to soil mineral N concentration and amounts of nitrate in the profile (to 1m) were generally quite low &lt;35 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;). Soil water dynamics under both rainfed and surface irrigated treatments were adequately simulated by the Agricultural Production System Simulator (APSIM) with RMSD &lt; 10% of the observed means and R&#178; &gt; 0.80 for the total soil profile (0-2000 mm). Simulation of growth and development was less satisfactory. For example, the RMSD was ~50% of observed mean for shoot biomass (R&#178; = 0.68) in the rainfed treatment, and 36% (R&#178; = 0.77) in the irrigated treatment. Overall, simulation of shoot DM production was close to observed values during the growing season (Apr-Nov), however the model was unable to capture the observed shoot yield in response to summer irrigation, with simulated shoot DM 40% less than the observed value in 2000 and 35% less in 2001. N dynamics were poorly simulated under these soil and climate conditions. Amounts of soil mineral nitrogen (kg NO&#8315;&#8323;-N ha&#8315;&#185;) were adequately simulated in rainfed conditions but consistently over-predicted under irrigated conditions. This evaluation of APSIM highlights both good and poor model performance and the analysis indicates the need for caution when applying the model in situations where observed data is scarce. Areas requiring improvements to the model are identified. Overall this research has improved understanding of the limitations to potential production of lucerne in a Mediterranean environment on duplex soils and shown that APSIM-Lucerne can be used confidently for many applications, particularly soil-water dynamics.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lucerne; agronomy; soil water; nitrogen; duplex soil; simulation modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56419</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors associated with mouse strain-dependent susceptibility to pathology in models of allergic asthma.</field><field name="creator">Tumes, Damon John</field><field name="description">Although exposed to similar environmental stimuli, not all humans develop asthma. Similarly, mouse strains vary in the degree of pathophysiology seen following induction of experimental asthma. A model involving immunization and aerosol challenge with ovalbumin (OVA) was used to investigate factors that may confer strain-dependent resistance or susceptibility to pathology. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice developed many features of human asthma including inflammation, mucus production and airway obstruction. In contrast, CBA/Ca mice were relatively resistant to development of disease. This was despite the presence of a robust systemic allergic response, as indicated by high levels of OVA-specific and total immunoglobulin and increases in circulating eosinophils comparable to those in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In interleukin (IL)-5 transgenic (Tg) mice the strain specific susceptibility to lung mucus production and airway obstruction was maintained and pathology was greatly accentuated in C57BL/6 and BALB/c but not in CBA/Ca mice. Eosinophils recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from wt and IL-5 Tg CBA/Ca mice lost viability faster than BAL eosinophils from the other two strains and this phenomenon was lung-specific. This may result in less eosinophil accumulation in the lungs of CBA/Ca mice and resistance to asthma-like pathology. Fl hybrids of CBA/Ca mice crossed with either BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice had BAL leukocyte, eosinophil lifespan and cell-free protein profiles similar to those of the respective disease-susceptible parental strains. It is likely that eosinophil apoptosis was not mediated through the extrinsic or receptor mediated pathway. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which both inhibit the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis were highest in BAL eosinophils from the BALB/c strain and this correlated with relatively high IL-5 levels in the lungs. Survivin inhibits apoptosis and expression was significantly higher in BALB/c and C57BL/6 BAL eosinophils than in cells from CBA/Ca mice. This suggests a possible mechanism whereby eosinophils from the asthma-susceptible C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice are more resistant to apoptosis and may account, in part, for the more extensive pathology in these strains. Using global gene expression analysis we identified groups of genes that were differentially regulated in the lungs of mice that are susceptible or resistant to development of asthma-like pathology. 242, 145 and 42 genes were differentially regulated in the lungs of the C57BL/6, BALB/C and CBA/Ca strains respectively. In C57BL/6 mice, transcripts were significantly enriched for adhesion molecules and we postulate that heightened expression of L-selectin, CD 18, PGSL-1 and LPAM-l on lung eosinophils is responsible for robust recruitment and therefore accumulation of these cells in C57BL/6 mice. 64 genes were differentially regulated only in the asthma-susceptible strains, several of which have not previously been associated witb asthma. The late expression of Chi313, Retnla and Mmp12 correlated with increased expression of IL-10 in the lungs and we hypothesise that this cytokine may be produced by alternatively activated macrophages as part of the resolution of disease. This study identifies several novel genes and mechanisms associated with the modulation of airway inflammation and pathology. The identification of factors that control allergic inflammation may provide novel therapeutic targets for disease intervention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asthma; eosinophil; apoptosis; microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56533</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimentally induced cortical plasticity: neurophysiological and functional correlates in health and disease.</field><field name="creator">Schabrun, Siobhan M.</field><field name="description">Neuroplasticity provides the basis for many of our most fundamental processes including learning, memory and the recovery of function following injury. This thesis is concerned with the neurophysiological and functional correlates of sensorimotor neuroplasticity in the healthy and focal dystonic populations. My initial experiments were conducted to determine the functional correlates of neuroplasticity induced in the primary motor (M1) and primary sensory (S1) cortices during a grip lift task. In healthy subjects these experiments further quantified the role of M1 in the anticipatory control of grip force scaling and demonstrated a role for S1 in triggering subsequent phases of the motor plan. My second series of experiments served to extend these findings by examining the functional correlates of neuroplasticity induced in the supplementary motor area (SMA). This study provided evidence for the role of left SMA in the control of grip force scaling and a role for left and right SMA in the synchronization of grip force and load force during the grip-lift synergy. Afferent input is known to be a powerful driver of cortical reorganisation. In particular, the timing and pattern of afferent input is thought to be crucial to the induction of plastic change. In healthy subjects, I examined the neurophysiological effects of applying &#8220;associative&#8221; (synchronous) and &#8220;non-associative&#8221; (asynchronous) patterns of afferent input to the motor points or digits of the hand. I observed an increase in the volume and area of the cortical representation of stimulated muscles when associative stimulation was applied over the motor points of two hand muscles. This pattern of stimulation also caused the centres of gravity of the stimulated muscles to move closer together, mimicking the maladaptive changes seen in focal hand dystonia. Non-associative stimulation and stimulation applied to the digits did not produce such an effect. Task-specific focal dystonia is characterised by excessive representational plasticity resulting in cortical representations which are significantly larger, and demonstrate greater overlap, than those seen in healthy individuals. These changes are thought to be driven, in part, by repetitive movement patterns which promote associative patterns of afferent input over an extended time period. On the basis of this knowledge, I applied non-associative stimulation to the hand muscles of dystonic subjects. Following this intervention, I noted a contraction of representational maps and a separation in the centres of gravity of the stimulated muscles. These neurophysiological changes were accompanied by improvements on a cyclic drawing task. This thesis demonstrates the functional correlates of neuroplasticity in M1, S1 and SMA during object manipulation using a precision grasp. These findings further extend our knowledge on the mechanisms underlying effective grasp control and assist us in the development of future rehabilitation protocols for neurological conditions involving grasp dysfunction. In addition, this thesis is the first to demonstrate an improvement in both neurophysiological and functional measures in focal dystonia following a period of non-associative afferent stimulation. These results open up exciting new avenues for the development of effective treatment protocols in those with focal hand dystonia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cortical plasticity; grip-lift task; primary motor cortex; focal hand dystonia; transcranial magnetic simulation; human</field><field name="subject">Neuroplasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key success drivers of service exports: the role of organisational characteristics, market characteristics and governance mechanisms.</field><field name="creator">Lu, Vinh Nhat</field><field name="description">The global marketplace has become highly integrated, and global competition is increasingly intense and dynamic. To be successful in this competitive and hostile environment, international firms must be able to foster and maintain successful cross-border inter-firm relationships. At the same time, service exports have remarkably emerged as a crucial component of international trade, underpinning the future growth and prosperity of national economies worldwide. Yet scholars and business practitioners alike have recognised the significant paucity of research on the performance of service exporters. Similarly, despite the recent growth in research interests in international relationship marketing, theoretical development in this area has failed to keep pace with the increase in both volume and magnitude of inter-organisational transactions across national borders. This study addressed the key research question of &#8220;What are the key factors driving the export performance of service firms?&#8221;, based on an integrated theoretical foundation comprising the resource-based view of the firm, transaction cost economics, and the relational exchange theory. The study took into account the potential role of: (1) organisational characteristics, (2) market characteristics, and (3) the governance mechanisms deployed by service firms in their management of cross-border relationships with their business clients. A multi-method research design was utilised for this research, including two main studies. An exploratory study was first conducted, involving 10 in-depth interviews with service exporters in South Australia. Drawing from the outcomes of the exploratory study and a review of the international services marketing and international relationship marketing literature, the researcher proposed a conceptual framework and a set of testable hypotheses. These hypotheses were then tested in the second research phase, in which the researcher conducted a self-administered mail survey, utilising both postal and online means. An effective response rate of 32.77%, or 254 usable responses, allowed the researcher to further analyse the data using the principles of structural equation modelling in AMOS. Thereby, the researcher identified 17 pairs of significant relationships between the variables. The research findings show that the performance of an export venture of a service firm is directly influenced by the size of the firm, their export experience, their managerial commitment, and the performance of the relationship with a major overseas client. Such relationship performance is determined by both contractual-based governance, including contractual complexity and contractual explicitness, and relational-based governance, a higher-order factor incorporating relationship trust, relationship commitment, information exchange, relationship flexibility and relationship harmony. In turn, these governance mechanisms are determined by various organisational and market characteristics. Whilst firm size, resource commitment, and assistance programs by home government influence the level of contractual complexity, contractual explicitness is determined by management commitment, competitive intensity, and the favourability of host government policies. Furthermore, relational-based governance is driven by the export experience of the firms, their managerial commitment, and the favourability of host government policies. The study contributes to advancing the scant international services marketing literature and draws further research attention to the international relationship marketing paradigm. With regards to international business practice, the study provides service exporters with an understanding on the potential role of organisational characteristics and market characteristics in their exporting success. Finally, a successful management of cross-border relationship management and governance mechanisms will also lead them to superior export performance.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service; export; international marketing; relationships; business to business; contract; performance; firm; market; commitment; government; Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56624</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The world is changing: ethics and genre development in three twentieth-century high fantasies.</field><field name="creator">Le Lievre, Kerrie Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three genre high fantasy texts published between 1954 and 2001: J. R. R. Tolkien&#8217;s 'The Lord of the Rings', Ursula K. Le Guin&#8217;s 'Earthsea' cycle and Patricia A. McKillip&#8217;s 'The Riddle-Master&#8217;s Game'. The emphasis is on examining how the three texts use a common set of structures to articulate a developing argument about forms of human engagement with the physical world in the face of environmental crisis. Using theories of literary ecology and narrative paradigm, I examine the common structure shared by the three high fantasies and the weight of ethical implications it carries. The texts position the transcendent impulse of the mode of tragedy, and the behaviour it generates, as the source of crisis, and posit as a solution to the problem the integrative ethic characteristic of the comedic mode. They argue that a transition between these two ethics is necessary for the continued survival of the Secondary World. This thesis examines each text&#8217;s use of narrative paradigm to articulate methods by which this ethical transition may be achieved. An argumentative trend is documented across the three fantasies through the representation of situation, problem and solution. In each text, as the Secondary World becomes more completely a closed physical system, the source of the solution to the problem caused by the transcendent presence and the achievement of ethical transition are both relocated within the control of human actors. The three fantasies express a gradual movement toward the acceptance of not only human responsibility for, but the necessity for action to remedy, the damaged state of the world. I argue that the texts&#8217; dominant concern is with the human relationship with and to context. Indeed, I argue that the three fantasies reflect the developing understanding of the human role in not only precipitating, but responding to, environmental crisis, and may function as both a reflection of and an intervention in that crisis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ethics; fantasy literature; hero figure; historiography; Le Guin, Ursula K.; McKillip, Patricia A.; secondary world; Tolkien, J.R.R.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56714</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gifts from Catherine.</field><field name="creator">Cleave, Kaye L.</field><field name="description">Title page, contents and abstract only.

Frequently, standardised assessments such as adaptive behaviour scales and, more recently, measures of support needs are used for determining level of need. The aim of this thesis is to understand the relationship between adaptive behaviours and support needs and to investigate factors that impact functional capacity and need for supports for individuals with an intellectual disability. Although a conceptually attractive approach to assessment, concern exists regarding the adequacy of the theoretical framework for guiding the development of support needs instruments. Though possessing theoretical similarities, adaptive behaviour and support needs scales are considered to measure different, albeit related constructs, prompting investigation into the nature of the relationship and the structure of the support needs construct. Accordingly, in Study 1 the Supports Intensity Scale (SIS), the Adaptive Behaviour Scale&#8211;Residential and Community (ABS-RC:2), and the Inventory for Client and Agency Planning (ICAP) were used to examine this relationship (N = 80). Dimensionality of the SIS (Section 1) was examined in reference to the three areas of conceptual, social, and practical skills, considered as comprising the adaptive behaviour construct. Factor analysis offered support for measurement of a common underlying construct. When considered in terms of the three adaptive behaviour skill areas, the support needs construct related predominantly to conceptual skills. Unlike adaptive behaviour scales, little is reported about the properties of support needs measures or factors that impact on an individual&#8217;s need for supports. Study 2 examined factors likely to influence adaptive behaviours and need for supports; in particular, the presence of coexisting disabilities. Using a measure of adaptive behaviour (i.e., ICAP) and two support needs scales (i.e., SIS and the Service Need Assessment Profile, SNAP), the extent to which adaptive and challenging behaviours and support needs (including medical) were impacted by the number and severity of disabilities was examined (N = 83). Results showed adaptive behaviours and support needs (including medical) were meaningfully related to the number and severity of disabilities present, whereas this was not so for challenging behaviours. Profiles for challenging behaviour measures did not support a linear association with number and severity of additional disabilities, raising the possibility that the profiles were influenced more by the nature of the additional disabilities present. Study 3 investigated the impact of the nature of the additional disabilities present on adaptive and challenging behaviours, support and medical needs using the same instruments utilised in Study 2. Each scale discriminated skills and needs associated with the presence of additional physical and speech disabilities. The support needs subscales of SNAP and SIS were more sensitive to the needs of individuals with coexisting neurological and sensory disabilities. SNAP was the only instrument to identify unique needs associated with the presence of a psychiatric disability but SIS was the only instrument to discriminate needs associated with the presence of a vision disability.

This species is highly susceptible to Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wilt nematode, which is not found in Australia. Potentially pathogenic nematodes were isolated from several dead Pinus trees in Williamstown, Heidelberg and Knoxfield, suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria in 2000-2002. A survey of the above-ground nematode fauna of Pinus and other conifers in south--eastern Australia was undertaken. Stands of Pinus were surveyed in the Kuipto Forest and the South-East Region of SA; the south-west and the Gippsland region of Victoria; and the Hume region in NSW; and native Callitris preissii was sampled in the Murray Mallee. A total of 1140 samples from P. radiata, 50 from P. pinaster and 40 from C. preissii were examined. No nematodes were found in wood or young shoots of conifers except in the wood samples from diseased trees at Knoxfield and Heidelberg in Victoria. In contrast, nematodes were common in the bark samples of healthy trees. Morphologically, extracted nematodes were classified into five trophic groups, including: aphelenchida (plant, fungal and lichen feeders), rhabditids and areolaimids (bacterial feeding), Macrolaimus spp. (saprophagus), tylenchids (plant feeding), and dorylaimids (bacterial and algal feeders). Aphelenchids were the most commonly found trophic group. Three genera and twelve morphospecies of aphelenchids were identified. Eight species of Laimaphelenchus and one putative species of Acugutturus appear to be new records for Australia. Descriptions of two new species, L. preissii and L. australis have been published. Three species of Aphelenchoides were also found. No Bursaphelenchus spp. were found. Molecular studies included sequencing of the ITS region of Laimaphelenchus preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, and Aphelenchid H1; D2D3 fragments of 28S and 18S of L. preissii, morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, and Aphelenchid H1, Laimaphelenchus australis, and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg; and COI of three aphelenchid morphospecies L. preissii, Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg and Aphelenchid K1. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Laimaphelenchus spp. are new species and that the unknown aphelenchids are close to Aphelenchoides. None of the six isolates studied from Australia was close to Bursaphelenchus. Population growth and mean doubling time of L. preissii, Aphelenchid K1 and Aphelenchid H1 were studied at different temperatures and on different food resources. The different species had markedly different population growth rates, which were significantly affected by temperature and food. A study on desiccation was carried out with L. preissii and morphospecies Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, Aphelenchid H1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg. Ability to survive desiccation varied between species, and the recovery rate of the different species was significantly different. A pathogenicity study was performed using young P. radiata trees in a shadehouse. No symptoms were observed following inoculation with Aphelenchid K1, Aphelenchid K2, Aphelenchid H1 and Laimaphelenchus Heidelberg isolated from diseased P. radiata in Victoria, or L. preissii from native Callitris in South Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57450</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-throughput assays for biotin protein ligase: a novel antibiotic target.</field><field name="creator">Ng, Belinda Ling Nah</field><field name="description">Antibiotics are defined as chemical substances that inhibit or limit the growth of microorganisms. Since the second world war, antibiotics have been widely used to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with serious bacterial infections caused by organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus. However, it has become increasingly difficult to treat bacterial infections due to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains. The first clinical case of drug resistant bacteria was observed in S. aureus in 1947, just four years after the mass production of penicillin. Since then, resistance has been reported to every antibiotic ever employed. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States, more than 70% of hospital-acquired infections show resistance to at least one commonly used antibiotic. Coupled with the paucity of therapeutic agents in the pipeline, there is now an urgent demand for new antibiotics. One of the strategies employed to combat drug resistant bacteria requires new chemical entities that work through novel drug targets for which there is no pre-existing resistance. This thesis focuses on the essential metabolic enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) as one such new drug target. BPL is the enzyme responsible for covalently attaching the cofactor biotin prosthetic group onto the biotin-dependent enzymes such as the carboxylases, decarboxylases and transcarboxylases. Enzymatic biotinylation proceeds via a two-step reaction whereby biotinyl-5'-AMP is synthesized from biotin and ATP before the biotin moiety is transferred onto the side chain of one specific lysine present in the active site of the biotin-dependent enzyme. One example of an important biotin-dependent enzyme is acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid biosynthesis. Through genetic studies, it has been demonstrated that BPL activity is essential for bacterial survival. The aim for this project was to develop a convenient, high-throughput assay to measure BPL activity. This assay would permit 1) quantitative kinetic analysis of ligands and inhibitors and 2) screening of compound libraries for new BPL inhibitors. We propose that BPL inhibitors can be developed into new antibiotic agents. The novel BPL assay was developed employing fluorescence polarization (FP). FP is a light based technique which uses plane polarized light for the detection of tumbling motion of fluorescent molecules in solution. As polarization of the emitted light is relative to the apparent molecular mass of the fluorophore, this technique can be use for quantitation of changes in molecular mass of target molecules. This enabled 1) rapid kinetic analysis, 2) a minimal number of handling steps, 3) no washing steps and 4) automation by robotics. A first generation assay was developed for Escherichia coli BPL using peptide 85-11 that has been shown to be a convenient substrate. Following the BPL reaction, biotinylated peptides will form large molecular mass complexes with avidin. The amount of product could then be quantitated using FP. Here, kinetic analysis of MgATP (Km 0.25 &#177; 0.01 mM) and biotin (Km 1.45 &#177; 0.15 &#956;M) binding produced results consistent with published data. We validated this assay with inhibition studies with end products of the BPL reaction, AMP and pyrophosphate, and a compound, biotinol-5'-AMP. Statistical analysis, performed upon both intraassay and interassay results (n = 30), showed the coefficient of variance to be &lt;10% across all data sets. Furthermore, the Z' factors between 0.5 and 0.8 demonstrated the utility of this technology in high-throughput applications. However, the use of peptide 85-11, a substrate specific to E. coli BPL, does limit the application of this methodology to E. coli. In the second generation FP assay, I adapted this technology for S. aureus BPL by employing the biotin domain of S. aureus pyruvate carboxylase. Insertion of a fluorescein label was achieved by first engineering a cysteine residue into the domain by site directed mutagenesis then incubation with fluorescein-5'-maleimide. A series of mutants was created to investigate optimal positioning of the label into the substrate. Furthermore, the minimal size of the functional domain was determined. Our data showed that the placement of the fluorescein label is an important aspect of this project. Using this approach, I identified that a 90 amino acid domain with the label at position 1134 was optimal. Kinetic analysis of ligand binding showed SaBPL had a Km for biotin at 3.29 &#177; 0.37 &#956;M and Km for MgATP at 66 &#177; 16.08 &#956;M. This was in good agreement with data obtained from our previous assay measuring &#179;H-biotin incorporation. Inhibitor studies with pyrophosphate and analogues of biotin and biotinyl-5'-AMP further validated the assay. Various studies have shown cross-species biotinylation activities by a diverse range of BPLs. Therefore, using this methodology with a biotin domain as the substrate potentially provides a convenient assay for all BPLs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biotin protein ligase; fluorescence polarization; enzyme assay; high-throughput compound screening</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57451</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast-food consumption: application and extension of the theory of planned behaviour to incorporate affective responses and implicit associations.</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Kirsten</field><field name="description">The consumption of energy-dense fast foods has been implicated as a causal factor in the development of obesity. The development of strategies to modify food choice behaviour requires an understanding of both the behaviour and the influencing factors (in particular, beliefs, attitudes, and social influences). The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1988) is one of the most widely used and accepted models of the intention-behaviour relationship within the health literature (Bagozzi, Wong, Abe, &amp; Bergami, 2000; Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998; Sheppard, Hartwick, &amp; Warshaw, 1988; Sutton, 1998). This thesis spans three studies, applying and extending the TPB to examine factors influencing fast-food consumption in an Australian population. The first study is a qualitative analysis examining components of the belief stage of the TPB, including behavioural outcome, normative, and control beliefs in relation to frequent fast-food consumption. Aside from details of these beliefs, which were used to develop a quantitative measure for application in the second study, the key outcomes of this study were a definition of fast food which was applied throughout each of the studies, clarification of how fast food fits within Australian lifestyles, and generation of additional information regarding other possible influences on fast-food consumption beyond those addressed by the TPB. The additional variables included for examination were affective responses to fast food, individual differences in sensitivity to reward, and the extent to which both consideration of the future consequences of frequent fast-food consumption and fear of being negatively evaluated are influential on consumption rates. The second, quantitative study applied both the TPB-based instrument developed from findings of the first study as well as the four additional measures with the aim of improving the explanatory ability of the TPB in terms of fast-food consumption. Structural equation modelling was used and although the model performed well overall, explaining up to 50% of the variance in both intention and behaviour, there were some variables that did not perform strongly. In particular, the measure of affective responses captured with a semantic differential scale was not significantly predictive, and the third study was designed and conducted to test the performance of a more sophisticated measure in the hope that implicit, in addition to explicit, responses would provide greater explanatory value. The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998; Greenwald, Nosek, &amp; Banaji, 2003) is said to provide some insight into more implicit attitudes by measuring the degree to which an individual associates conceptual categories through response latencies (or timed responses) whilst opportunities for introspection are minimised. Some have also suggested that the IAT may contribute well when it is combined with other measures, particularly in the prediction of behaviour, choice, or judgement (Brunel, Tietje, &amp; Greenwald, 2004). Therefore, the third study combined measures based on the TPB with the IAT to investigate the nature of both implicit and explicit beliefs underlying attitudes towards fast foods. Overall, the associations captured by the IAT did not help to explain a great deal of variance in fast-food consumption, although there were differences in associations according to stimulus type with arousal-related stimuli generating stronger results than valence-related stimuli. Differences in associations with fast food were also found across groups divided according to Body Mass Index, with overweight people demonstrating more positive associations than either normal weight or obese people. A summary discusses the potential application of the findings in the development and implementation of future intervention and obesity prevention strategies as well as directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of planned behaviour; fast-food; Implicit Associations Test; beliefs; attitudes; affect; food choice</field><field name="subject">Health behavior.</field><field name="subject">Social psychology.</field><field name="subject">Convenience foods.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57506</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship of mineral and bone metabolism in the systematic response to neurotrauma of adult males with spinal cord injury.</field><field name="creator">Clark, Jillian Mary</field><field name="description">Biochemical assays and radioabsorptiometry evaluated the relationship of mineral and bone metabolism to the systemic response to neurotrauma or orthopaedic trauma of adult males. Forty-one adult males (29.4&#177;9.3 years) participated of which 37 had a primary diagnosis of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and four were vertebral fracture controls. Biochemical abnormalities found included hyperphosphataemia, in association with low or low normal serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitmain D (1,25(OH)&#8322;D) and of parathyroid hormone (PTH), whilst patients remained normocalcaemic. These disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone were strongly associated with the interval since injury and the severity of injury, but none of these relationships was correlated with the level of the injury, the sensory status of a patient or the presence of spine fracture. The disturbances of phosphate and vitamin D metabolism and the markedly accelerated resorption of bone found in this study are a mirror image of the data of patients with the heritable disorders autosomal dominant hyperphosphataemic rickets (ADHR), which results from an inactivating mutation of the gene encoding fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and autosomal recessive hypophosphataemic rickets (ARHR), which is caused by a mutation of the gene encoding dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1). It is potentially important that the hormone/proteolytic enzyme/extra-cellular matrix protein cascade associated with these disorders is counter-regulated by 1,25(OH)&#8322;D, acting either directly or indirectly. The present results suggest that the serum levels of 1,25(OH)&#8322;D of the neurotrauma patients chosen for study may have been inappropriately high with respect to the &#8220;physiological and metabolic set&#8221; of serum levels of phosphate and ionised calcium in the period corresponding to the uncoupling of the resorption and formation of bone, at least in males, prompting further investigation. The findings are consistent with a new &#8220;physiological set,&#8221; possibly involving an abnormality in the synthesis or processing of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors or other circulating phosphatonins, which may act as an additional level of regulation of the renal&#8211;bone axis, rather than renal failure. Strongly supporting this was the dynamic pattern of the biochemistry and radiological data of these neurotrauma patients and also, preliminary evidence of disturbances in circulating levels of other systemic modulators of mineral and bone metabolism. The relationships that were observed potentially may be explained by the diversity of the physiological activities of the endocrine fibroblast growth factors and the modes of actions of secreted FGF23 in bone. The findings provide an understanding of why bone loss occurs and may form the target for safe and cost effective interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spinal cord injury; osteoporosis; bone mineral density; vitamin D metabolism; phosphate metabolism</field><field name="subject">Nervous system Wounds and injuries Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57507</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insulin-like growth factor-II and its role in blastocyst development, implantation and placentation.</field><field name="creator">Pringle, Kirsty Gay</field><field name="description">Impaired implantation and placental development have been implicated in several disorders of pregnancy such as unexplained miscarriage, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation. Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF)-II has previously been shown to promote blastocyst development and placental growth and function. We were interested in how IGF-II interacts with other factors throughout blastocyst development, implantation and placentation in the mouse to improve pregnancy outcome. In vitro embryo culture increases the risk of pregnancy complications associated with poor placentation. Recent research has focussed on optimising the culture conditions to more resemble that of the in vivo environment. IGF-II, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator (uPA) and Plasminogen individually have all been shown to be important for embryo development. However, it is likely that a combination of factors is required to counteract the negative effects of in vitro culture. Here we show that IGF-II, uPA and Plasminogen, in combination, significantly improve mouse blastocyst hatching rates and implantation rates on day 8 and doubles the number of mothers that are pregnant after embryo transfer. Following implantation, IGF-II is suggested to play a role in promoting placental development and function. We demonstrate that IGF-II is co-localised with both IGF receptors throughout early pregnancy in trophoblasts and in the developing blood vessels and adjacent stromal cells in the mesometrial decidua. This suggests that IGF-II may play a role in both decidual angiogenesis and placentation. We suggest that perhaps murine trophoblasts secrete molecules such as IGF-II to promote angiogenesis in the decidua early in pregnancy to compensate for their shallow invasion and allow for adequate trophoblast remodelling later in pregnancy. The first trimester human placenta experiences a low oxygen environment. The Hypoxia-Inducible Factors (HIFs) mediate the response to low oxygen, inducing genes such as IGF-II. Currently, the role of oxygen in mouse placentation, the mechanisms by which HIFs promote placentation or their interaction with IGF-II in the placenta is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the early mouse implantation site is exposed to low oxygen levels similar to those seen in humans and expresses HIF-1&#61537; protein. We were interested then in the interaction between IGF-II, oxygen and HIFs in trophoblasts in vitro. Prolonged exposure to low oxygen reduced trophoblast outgrowth, and increased Tpbp mRNA levels, suggesting commitment to the spongiotrophoblast lineage. Interestingly, we found that antisense (as) Hif-1&#61537; may mediate the response to prolonged hypoxia in murine trophoblasts. Importantly, Hif-1&#61537; and Hif-2&#61537; were differentially regulated by oxygen and IGF-II in cultured trophoblast cells suggesting a novel interaction between IGF-II and oxygen. In conclusion, it appears that IGF-II is a central growth factor which interacts with other molecules to regulate a wide variety of process in early pregnancy to promote blastocyst development, implantation and placentation. The results outlined in this thesis demonstrate a novel interaction between IGF-II, uPA and Plasminogen in promoting blastocyst development and implantation which may be used to improve pregnancy outcome following ART. In addition, we have also identified a novel interaction between IGF-II, oxygen and the HIF system which may regulate trophoblast function. This has important implications not only for placental research, but also for cancer research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin-like growth factor-II; hypoxia inducible factor; placenta; blastocyst; implantation; oxygen</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57513</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weed resistance risk management in glyphosate-resistant cotton</field><field name="creator">Werth, Jeff Alan</field><field name="description">The introduction of glyphosate resistance into Australian cotton systems will have an effect on conventional weed management practices, the weed species present and the risk of glyphosate resistance evolving in weed species. Therefore, it is important that the effects of these management practices, particularly a potential reduction in Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices, be examined to determine their impact on weed population dynamics and resistance selection. The study began in 2003 with a survey of 40 growers in four major cotton growing regions in Australia to gain an understanding of how adoption of glyphosate resistance had influenced the weed spectrum, weed management practices and herbicide use after three years of glyphosate-resistant cotton being available. The 10 most common weeds reported on cotton fields were the same in glyphosate-resistant and conventional fields. In this survey, herbicide use patterns were altered by the adoption of glyphosate-resistant cotton with up to six times more glyphosate being applied and with 21% fewer growers applying pre-emergence herbicides in glyphosate-resistant cotton fields. Other weed control practices, such as the use of post-emergence herbicides, inter-row cultivation and hand hoeing, were only reduced marginally. A systems experiment was conducted to determine differences in the population dynamics of Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) and Urochloa panicoides (liverseed grass) under a range of weed management regimes in a glyphosate-resistant cotton system. These treatments ranged from a full IWM system to a system based soley on the use of glyphosate. The experiment investigated the effect of the treatments on the soil seed bank, weed germination patterns and weed numbers in the field. All applied treatments resulted in commercially acceptable control of the two grass weeds. However, the treatments containing soil-applied residual herbicides proved to be more effective over the period of the experiment. The treatment with a reduced residual herbicide program supplemented with glyphosate had a level of control similar to the full IWM treatments with less input, providing a more economical option. The effectiveness of these treatments in the long-term was examined in a simulation model to determine the likelihood of glyphosate resistance evolving using barnyardgrass and liverseed grass as model weeds. Seed production and above-ground biomass of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass in competition with cotton were measured. In all experiments, seed production and biomass plant&#8315;&#185;  decreased as weed density increased while seed production and biomass m&#8315;&#185; tended to increase. Seed production m&#8315;&#185; reached 40,000 and 60,000 for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. In 2004-05, weeds were also planted 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the cotton was planted. Biomass and seed production of the two weeds planted 6 weeks after cotton were significantly reduced with seed production declining to 12,000 and 2,500 seeds m&#8315;&#185; row for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. Weeds planted 12 weeks after cotton planting failed to emerge. This experiment highlighted the importance of early season weed control and effective management of weeds that are able to produce high seed numbers. A glyphosate dose-mortality experiment was conducted in the field to determine levels of control of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass. Glyphosate provided effective control of both species with over 85% control when the rate applied was greater than 690 g ae ha&#8315;&#185;. Dose-mortality curves for both species were obtained for use in the glyphosate resistance model. Data from the experimental work were combined to develop a glyphosate resistance model. Outputs from this model suggest that if glyphosate were used as the only form of weed control, resistance in weeds is likely to eventuate after 12 to 17 years, depending on the characteristics of the weed species, initial resistance gene frequencies and any associated fitness penalties. If glyphosate was used in conjunction with one other weed control method, resistance was delayed but not prevented. The simulations suggested that when a combination of weed control options was employed in addition to glyphosate, resistance would not evolve over the 30-year period of the simulation. These simulations underline the importance of an integrated strategy in weed management to prevent glyphosate resistance evolving from the use of glyphosate-resistant cotton. Current management conditions of growing glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready &amp;reg) cotton should therefore prevent glyphosate resistance evolution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cotton, weeds--control, herbicides, herbicide resistance, glyphosate</field><field name="subject">Weeds Control</field><field name="subject">Cotton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unravelling the tectonic framework of the Musgrave Province, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Wade, Benjamin P.</field><field name="description">The importance of the Musgrave Province in continental reconstructions of Proterozoic Australia is only beginning to be appreciated. The Mesoproterozoic Musgrave Province sits in a geographically central location within Australia and is bounded by older and more isotopically evolved regions including the Gawler Craton of South Australia and Arunta Region of the Northern Territory. Understanding the crustal growth and deformation mechanisms involved in the formation of the Musgrave Province, and also the nature of the basement that separates these tectonic elements, allows for greater insight into defining the timing and processes responsible for the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. The ca. 1.60-1.54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss preserves geochemical and isotopic signatures related to ongoing arc-magmatism in an active margin between the North Australian and South Australian Cratons (NAC and SAC). Characteristic geochemical patterns of the Musgravian Gneiss include negative anomalies in Nb, Ti, and Y, and are accompanied by steep LREE patterns. Also characteristic of the Musgravian Gneiss is its juvenile Nd isotopic composition (&#603;Nd1.55 values from -1.2 to +0.9). The juvenile isotopic signature of the Musgravian Gneiss separates it from the bounding comparitively isotopically evolved terranes of the Arunta Region and Gawler Craton. The geochemical and isotopic signatures of these early Mesoproterozoic felsic rocks have similarities with island arc systems involving residual Ti-bearing minerals and garnet. Circa 1.40 Ga metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province also record vital evidence for determining Australia.s location and fit within a global plate reconstruction context during the late Mesoproterozoic. U-Pb detrital zircon and Sm-Nd isotopic data from these metasedimentary rocks suggests a component of derivation from sources outside of the presently exposed Australian crust. Best fit matches come from rocks originating from eastern Laurentia. Detrital zircon ages range from Palaeoproterozoic to late Mesoproterozoic, constraining the maximum depositional age of the metasediments to approximately 1.40 Ga, similar to that of the Belt Supergroup in western Laurentia. The 1.49-1.36 Ga detrital zircons in the Musgrave metasediments are interpreted to have been derived from the voluminous A-type suites of Laurentia, as this time period represents a &#8220;magmatic gap&#8221; in Australia, with an extreme paucity of sources this age recognized. The metasedimentary rocks exhibit a range of Nd isotopic signatures, with &#603;Nd(1.4 Ga) values ranging from -5.1 to 0.9, inconsistent with complete derivation from Australian sources, which are more isotopically evolved. The isotopically juvenile ca. 1.60-1.54 Ga Musgravian Gneiss is also an excellent candidate for the source of the abundant ca. 1.6-1.54 Ga detrital zircons within the lower sequences of the Belt Supergroup. If these interpretations are correct, they support a palaeogeographic reconstruction involving proximity of Australia and Laurentia during the pre-Rodinia Mesoproterozoic. This also increases the prospectivity of the eastern Musgrave Province to host a metamorphised equivalent of the massive Pb-Zn-Ag Sullivan deposit. The geochemical and isotopic signatures recorded in mafic-ultramafic rocks can divulge important information regarding the state of the sub continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). The voluminous cumulate mafic-ultramafic rocks of the ca. 1.08 Ga Giles Complex record geochemical and Nd-Sr isotopic compositions consistent with an enriched parental magma. Traverses across three layered intrusions, the Kalka, Ewarara, and Gosse Pile were geochemically and isotopically analysed. Whole rock samples display variably depleted to enriched LREE patterns when normalised to chondrite ((La/Sm)N = 0.43-4.72). Clinopyroxene separates display similar depleted to enriched LREE patterns ((La/Sm)N = 0.37-7.33) relative to a chondritic source. The cumulate rocks display isotopically evolved signatures (&#603;Nd ~-1.0 to .5.0 and &#603;Sr ~19.0 to 85.0). Using simple bulk mixing and AFC equations, the Nd-Sr data of the more radiogenic samples can be modelled by addition of ~10% average Musgrave crust to a primitive picritic source, without need for an enriched mantle signature. Shallow decompressional melting of an asthenospheric plume source beneath thinned Musgravian lithosphere is envisaged as a source for the parental picritic magma. A model involving early crustal contamination within feeder zones is favoured, and consequently explorers looking for Ni-Cu-Co sulphides should concentrate on locating these feeder zones. Few absolute age constraints exist for the timing of the intracratonic Petermann Orogeny of the Musgrave Province. The Petermann Orogeny is responsible for much of the lithospheric architecture we see today within the Musgrave Province, uplifting and exhuming large parts along crustal scale E-W trending fault/shear systems. Isotopic and geochemical analysis of a suite of stratigraphic units within the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Officer Basin to the immediate south indicate the development of a foreland architecture at ca. 600 Ma. An excursion in &#603;Nd values towards increasingly less negative values at this time is interpreted as representing a large influx of Musgrave derived sediments. Understanding the nature of the basement separating the SAC from the NAC and WAC is vital in constructing models of the amalgamation of Proterozoic Australia. This region is poorly understood as it is overlain by the thick sedimentary cover of the Officer Basin. However, the Coompana Block is one place where basement is shallow enough to be intersected in drillcore. The previously geochronologically, geochemically, and isotopically uncharacterised granitic gneiss of the Coompana Block represents an important period of within-plate magmatism during a time of relative magmatic quiescence in the Australian Proterozoic. U-Pb LA-ICPMS dating of magmatic zircons provides an age of ca. 1.50 Ga, interpreted as the crystallisation age of the granite protolith. The samples have distinctive A-type chemistry characterised by high contents of Zr, Nb, Y, Ga, LREE with low Mg#, Sr, CaO and HREE. &#603;Nd values are high with respect to surrounding exposed crust of the Musgrave Province and Gawler Craton, and range from +1.2 to +3.3 at 1.5 Ga. The tectonic environment into which the granite was emplaced is also unclear, however one possibility is emplacement within an extensional environment represented by interlayered basalts and arenaceous sediments of the Coompana Block. Regardless, the granitic gneiss intersected in Mallabie 1 represents magmatic activity during the &#8220;Australian magmatic gap&#8221; of ca. 1.52-1.35 Ga, and is a possible source for detrital ca. 1.50 zircons found within sedimentary rocks of Tasmania and Antarctica, and metasedimentary rocks of the eastern Musgrave Province.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology; Geomorphology; Geology, Structural; Paleontology--Proterozoic</field><field name="subject">Historical geology Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Australia South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Geology Australia Northern Territory.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic Proterozoic.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic Cambrian.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57768</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical investigation of wind input and spectral dissipation in evolution of wind waves.</field><field name="creator">Tsagareli, Kakha</field><field name="description">The present study comprised an intensive investigation of the two newly proposed parameterisation forms for the wind input source term S[subscript]in (Donelan et a1., 2006) and the wave dissipation source term S[subscript]ds (Young and Babanin, 2006) proposed on the basis of the recent experimental findings at Lake George, New South Wales, Australia in 1997-2000. The main objective of this study was to obtain advanced spectral forms for the wind input source function S[subscript]in and wave spectral dissipation source function S[subscript]ds, which satisfy important physical constraints. A new approach was developed to achieve the objectives of this study, within the strong physical framework. This approach resulted in a new balance scheme between the energy source terms in the wave model, mentioned before as the split balance scheme (Badulin, 2006). The wave-induced stress was defined as the main physical constraint for a new wave model including recently suggested source functions for the wind input and wave dissipation source terms. Within this approach, a new methodology was developed for correction of the wind input source function S[subscript]in. Another important physical constraint was the consistency between the wave dissipation and the wind energy input to the waves. The new parameter, the dissipation rate, R, was introduced in this study, as the ratio of the wave dissipation energy to the wind input energy. The parameterisation form of the dissipation rate is presented as a function of the inverse wave age U &#8321;&#8320; / c[subscript]p Some aspects of wave spectral modelling regarding the shape of the wave spectrum and spectral saturation were revised. The two-phase behaviour of the spectral dissipation function was investigated in terms of the functional dependency of the coefficients a for the inherent wave breaking term and b for the forced dissipation term. The present study found that the both coefficients have functional dependence on the inverse wave age U &#8321;&#8320; / c[subscript]p and the spectral frequency. Based on the experimental data by Young and Babanin (2006), a new directional spreading function of bimodal shape was developed for the wave dissipation source term. The performance of the new spectral functions of the wind input S[subscript]in(f) and the wave dissipation S[subscript]ds(f) source terms was assessed using a new third-generation two-dimensional research wave model WAVETIME-I. The model incorporating the corrected source functions was able to reproduce the existing experimental data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waves; spectral models; VAM; SWAM; wave steepness; Combi spectra; JONSWAP; wave dissipation; saturation transformer; wave phase; atmospheric input source term</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57907</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early life stages of the southern sea garfish, Hyporhamphus Melanochir (Valenciennes 1846), and their association with seagrass beds.</field><field name="creator">Noell, Craig J</field><field name="description">This study investigates early life stages of the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir) and their association with seagrass in Gulf St Vincent, South Australia. The overall aims were to identify and describe the early life stages of H. melanochir and to explore the possible relationship(s) between these life stages and seagrass habitat with the emphasis on seagrass as a requirement for spawning or as a food source. The reproductive biology of female H. melanochir from the commercial fishery was assessed by microscopic examination of ovaries, oocyte size distributions, gonadosomatic indices, and macroscopic ovarian stages. Five stages of oocyte development were identified and described: perinucleolar, yolk vesicle, yolk globule, migratory nucleus and hydrated. A coherence between histological and whole oocyte descriptions is demonstrated. Hyporhamphus melanochir are characterised as multiple spawners with group-synchronous oocyte development and indeterminate fecundity. A protracted spawning season from October to March was indicated by the occurrence of ripe ovaries and increases in gonadosomatic index. Females reach sexual maturity at 193 mm standard length, and batch fecundity ranged from 201-3044 oocytes depending on fish size. Spawning shoals are segregated by sex, as indicated by commercial samples, with a biased female-to-male ratio of 4.5:1 during the spawning season (1.2:1 during the non-spawning season). In addition, features of the oocyte surface were closely examined, which revealed that the filaments on the chorion of the hydrated oocyte are adhesive. These adhesive filaments presumably allow the fertilised egg to become attached to vegetative substrate by adhesion and/or entanglement. H. melanochir larvae were discriminated from another hemiramphid species, river garfish (H. regularis), which is also known to occur in the study area, based on species-specific amplification of part of the mitochondrial control region using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The species were easily discerned by the number and distinct sizes of PCR products [H. melanochir, 443 bp; river garfish (H. regularis), 462 and 264 bp]. Although based on a single gene, this molecular method will correctly identify the species of individuals in at least 96% and 94% of tests for H. melanochir and H. regularis, respectively. Subsequent to verifying the identification of species by molecular discrimination, the larval development of H. melanochir and H. regularis were described. Larvae of H. melanochir and H. regularis had completed notochord flexion at hatching and are characterized by their elongate body with distinct rows of melanophores along the dorsal, lateral and ventral surfaces; small to moderate head; heavily pigmented, long straight gut; persistent preanal finfold; and extended lower jaw. Fin formation occurs in the sequence: caudal, dorsal and anal (almost simultaneously), pectoral, pelvic. Despite the similarities between both species and among hemiramphid larvae in general, H. melanochir larvae are distinguishable from H. regularis by: having 58-61 vertebrae (v. 51-54 for H. regularis); having 12-15 melanophore pairs in longitudinal rows along the dorsal margin between the head and origin of the dorsal fin (v. 19-22 for H. regularis); and the absence of a large ventral pigment blotch anteriorly on the gut and isthmus (present in H. regularis). A logistic regression analysis of body measurements also revealed interspecies differences in the combined measurements of eye diameter and pre-anal fin length. Both species can be distinguished from morphologically similar larvae found in southern Australia (other hemiramphids and a scomberosocid) by differences in meristic counts and pigmentation. Hyporhamphus melanochir larvae were successfully collected throughout Gulf St Vincent using a neuston net; however, attempts to sample eggs were unsuccessful. Abundances of larvae in the gulf averaged 4.8 and 12.3 larvae 1000&#8315; &#178; of surface water in December 1998 and December 2000, respectively. Larvae exhibit fast growth, as indicated by otolith growth increments, with backcalculated spawning dates falling within the October-March spawning season. Spatial analysis of larval distributions revealed a positive spatial autocorrelation, i.e. non-randomness or clustering of similar abundance values. Most larvae were found in the upper region of the gulf, and the prevalence of seagrass habitat throughout this region supports the view that the demersal eggs of H. melanochir become attached to seagrass and/or algae following spawning. A gyre in waters of the upper gulf, influenced by prevailing southerly winds, the Coriolis effect, and land boundaries, may explain retention of larvae. The importance of seagrass beds to H. melanochir spawning is also supported by anecdotal evidence and available literature on eggs of other Beloniformes, which are also demersal and attach to marine plants. Dual stable isotope analysis (&#948;&#185;&#179; and &#948;&#185;&#8309;N) of larval, juvenile and adult H. melanochir and several potential food sources from the Bay of Shoals was carried out to estimate the importance of zosteracean seagrass towards the assimilated diet of H. melanochir. Although the diet of H. melanochir larvae is probably planktonivorous, their isotopic signatures partly reflect the parental diet due to the influence of pre&amp;ndash;existing tissue in addition to growth. According to mixing model calculations, the signatures of juveniles can be explained by a diet consisting of 23&amp;ndash;37% Zostera, 0&amp;ndash;10% Halophila and the remainder zooplankton, whilst the diet of adults consists of 53&amp;ndash;58% Zostera and the remainder zooplankton. These findings indicate an increasing dependence upon Zostera with growth of H. melanochir. The results of this study enhance the completeness of our understanding of the fisheries biology and ecology of H. melanochir. Significant contributions are provided in reproductive biology and larval biology, seagrass beds (in combination with mixed algae) are demonstrated to be an important habitat for spawning, and Zostera seagrass is shown to be a necessary food source in the diet of juveniles and adults.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">garfish, gars, larvae, seagrasses</field><field name="subject">Fishes Breeding South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Seagrasses Australia South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57972</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification, diversity and detection of Xanthomonas strains associated with pistachio dieback in Australia.</field><field name="creator">Marefat, Alireza</field><field name="description">Bacterial dieback disease was first observed on pistachio (Pistacia vera) trees in Australia in 1992 and has not been reported elsewhere. The disease is characterised by shoot death and dieback, limb and trunk lesions and discolouration of woody tissue in shoots more than one year old. Xanthomonas strains have been the only micro-organism consistently isolated from diseased trees. Characterisation of a small number of strains of the pathogen has already shown close relatedness to X. translucens. At the commencement of this study knowledge about genetic diversity of the pathogen was lacking, characterization of the pathogen and its taxonomic position were rudimentary and there was no efficient, reliable and rapid tool to detect and to recognise the pathogen in planting materials. In this study, a three-step strategy was undertaken: First, the genetic diversity of Xanthomonas strains isolated from infected pistachio trees from different geographic regions of Australia over several years was examined by repetitive extragenic palindromic:polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR). Rep-PCR revealed two distinct genotypes, group A and group B, among the strains and showed some variation within group A. There was an association between the two groups and the geographic origin of the strains. Second, physiological and biochemical tests, including the Biolog microplate(TM) System, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of whole cell protein analysis were used to characterise and identify the strains. To obtain a sound taxonomic allocation of pistachio strains within the genus Xanthomonas, the relatedness of pistachio strains to known Xanthomonas species and strains was assessed by comparison of the 16S-23S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S rDNA sequences, rep-PCR genomic fingerprints and DNA:DNA homology. Pathogenicity of the strains was assessed on selected members of the Poaceae and Anacardiaceae. Results of physiological and biochemical tests including Biolog analysis and protein profiling confirmed the existence of the two groups within the pathogen. Furthermore, the pathogen was identified as X. translucens. ITS sequencing confirmed two distinct genotypes among the strains and suggested that the pathogen strains were closely related to X. t. pv. poae. Based on 16S rDNA sequencing, pistachio strains matched most closely X. t. pv. translucens. While DNA:DNA homology studies confirmed that pistachio strains from both groups belong to X. translucens, rep-PCR showed that xanthomonads from pistachio differ from known pathovars of the species. Pathogenicity and host range studies indicated that the two groups were biologically different and suggested that these strains represent two new pathovars of the species. Third, specific primers for amplification of DNA of the pathogen were developed based on sequences of the ITS region from strains representing groups A and B. Primers were designed for amplification of DNA sequences specific to each group and a multiplex PCR test was developed that identified and differentiated strains of each group in a single assay. To determine the specificity of the primers, PCR was carried out with DNA from 65 strains of the pathogen, 31 type and reference strains of Xanthomonas, and from 191 phytobacteria commonly found in and around pistachio orchards. In the multiplex PCR, a 331 bp fragment was amplified from all strains belonging to group A and a 120 bp fragment from all strains in group B. No PCR products were obtained from the other bacteria tested except for the type strain of X. translucens pv. cerealis, which has not been found in Australia. The assay was used to detect strains from both groups of the pathogen in pistachio plant material. This study will contribute to understanding of the epidemiology and management of pistachio dieback.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58134</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the periconceptional environment (in vivo and ex vivo) on feto-placental development in the sheep.</field><field name="creator">MacLaughlin, Severence Michael</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

In the first part (Chapter 3), three cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) adapted to South Australian conditions were tested for drought tolerance under cyclic drought in growth rooms and glasshouse. Extensive physiological traits, including stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, ABA content, water status traits (e.g. osmotic adjustment, RWC and leaf water potential), water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and carbon isotope discrimination (&#916;&#185; &#179;C) were measured during experiments. Through these experiments, the drought responses of the three cultivars were physiologically dissected and the likely processes contributing most to drought tolerance were identified. In the South Australian wheatbelt, cyclic drought is a frequent event, represented by intermittent periods of rainfall which can occur around anthesis and post-anthesis in wheat. Three South Australian bread wheat cultivars, Excalibur, Kukri and RAC875, were evaluated in two growth room experiments under cyclic water-limiting conditions. In the first experiment, where plants were subjected to severe water stress, RAC875 and Excalibur (drought tolerant) showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher grain yield under cyclic water availability compared to Kukri (drought susceptible), producing 44% and 18% more grain yield compared to Kukri, respectively. In the second growth room experiment, where plants were subjected to a milder drought stress, the differences between cultivars were less pronounced, with only RAC875 showing significantly higher grain yield under the cyclic water treatment. Grain number per spike and the percentage of aborted tillers were the major yield components that affected yield under cyclic water stress. Excalibur and RAC875 adopted different morpho-physiological traits and mechanisms to reduce water stress. Excalibur was most responsive to cyclic water availability and showed the highest level of osmotic adjustment (OA), highest stomatal conductance, lowest ABA content and most rapid recovery from stress under cyclic water stress. RAC875 was more &#8216;conservative&#8217; in its responses, with moderate OA, high leaf waxiness, high chlorophyll content and slower recovery from stress. Within this germplasm, the capacity for osmotic adjustment was the main physiological attribute associated with tolerance under cyclic water stress, which enabled plants to recover from water deficit. In the second part (Chapter 4), the genetic linkage map of a DH population including 368 lines, which was developed from a cross between &#8216;RAC875&#8217; and &#8216;Kukri&#8217;, was constructed. The genetic linkage map consisted of about 500 molecular markers including ~300 DArT (Diversity array technology) and ~200 SSR (Microsattelite markers). In the third part (Chapter 5), Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) linked to plant phenology and production traits under irrigated and drought stress conditions were mapped by means of a DH population. To phenotype the population, 368 DH lines were cultivated in two replicates in five environments (three sites across South Australian wheatbelt in collaboration with Australian Grain Technology (AGT) in 2006, and two trials in Mexico in collaboration with CYMMIT, 2007). Data of grain yield, yield components, maturity related traits and some morpho-physiological traits such as leaf chlorophyll content, leaf waxiness, plant height, peduncle length, flag leaf and spike length were measured. Raw data were then analysed for spatial variation for each single trial using the REML procedure in GenStat (version 6). The DH lines showed significant variation for plant phenology, grain yield and yield components under irrigated and drought stress conditions. QTL analyses were performed using QTLCartographer and QTLNetwork for each trait in each site. Two major QTL for maturity traits were identified on chromosomes 2BS and 2DS corresponding to Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1, respectively. A region was identified on chromosome 7A that harbored major QTL for grain yield, number of grains per square meter, number of grain per spike and spike fertility under drought stress. For yield data in the irrigated trial, two major QTL were identified on chromosome 3B which were not detected in drought stress environments. By using different datasets in the QTL analysis (splitting the population into two subpopulation based on heading time and also adjusting the phenotypic data for heading time to eliminate heading time effect), a QTL for grain yield was consistently detected on chromosome 7A in drought-affected environments. The coincidence of a drought response index QTL on this chromosome indicated that it might be a QTL for yield response under drought. This study demonstrated that the region on the long arm of chromosome 7A identified for grain yield and yield components is a drought response QTL which is closely linked to, but separate from, a heading time QTL. This QTL cluster on chromosome 7A could be used as a good target for positional cloning and gene isolation. However further work would be required to confirm and validate the identified QTLs in this preliminary QTL analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drought; wheat; linkage map; quantitative trait loci (QTL)</field><field name="subject">Wheat Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Wheat Growth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the use of Bacillariophyceae as biological monitors of heavy metal pollution in Australian tropical streams.</field><field name="creator">Von Falkenhayn, Louise</field><field name="description">During the recessional flow period of 2004, benthic diatoms were sampled from four catchments in the tropics of the Northern Territory of Australia. Each of the catchments showed evidence of acid mine drainage. Diatoms were used in conjunction with physical and chemical water parameters to provide a biomonitoring approach with the ultimate goal to assess the water quality of the mine impacted catchments. A total of 267 species of diatoms from 45 genera were recorded from 50 sites in the Northern Territory. One of the primary aims of this study was to assess diatom classification techniques, morphological and genetic, for the accurate identification of the morphologically variable taxon, Nitzschia palea. A second primary aim was to determine the degree to which diatom taxa and community structures can be effectively used as biological indicators and monitors of heavy metal pollution in tropical aquatic environments. To address the lack of diatom floristic studies from the Northern Territory, an iconograph of the most abundant taxa was created. Forty eight Nitzschia palea-like cells were cultured and then grouped by hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward&#8217;s method). The reliability of the groups was tested with discriminant analysis. The morphological groups were compared to the phylogenetic grouping of 20 of the cultures which were each genetically sequenced using the nuclear-encoded small subunit rDNA. For monitoring studies, multivariate statistical techniques were used to produce models to infer environmental variables from diatom distributions. The three datasets used varied in terms of the level of taxonomic identification and the inclusion of bioavailable or total metal concentrations. The program AquaRisk was employed to determine the bioavailable concentrations of the heavy metals. Each dataset was related to water quality parameters using canonical correspondence analysis. The Simpson&#8217;s index and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were statistically related, together with species richness, to the variables pH and copper through bivariate regression analysis. To determine the usefulness of individual diatom taxa as indicators, species were selected based on their occurrence, weighted average optima and tolerance values, and species response curves. Additionally, teratogenic frustules were statistically correlated with environmental variables by bivariate and linear regression. Although the Nitzschia palea-like cultures displayed morphological variation, which could be used separate the cultures into five distinct groups, the cultures were not found to be genetically variable. However, one new species, Nitzschia sp. 39, was defined genetically and described morphologically. As with other analyses of mine impacts, canonical correspondence analysis identified pH and aluminium as the principal environmental factors structuring the diatom communities. The calibration set models generated to infer pH and heavy metals had high predicative capabilities. Overall, the species dataset, rather than the datasets utilising genus level identification or bioavailable metal fractions, provided the statistically strongest results. Monitoring using diversity indices was less successful for indicating pollution. Contrary to findings from other studies, species richness tended to be higher in polluted waters than control sites. Unlike other studies of acidic environments, the species Chamaepinnularia mediocris, Naviculadicta subtilissima, Nitzschia vasta and Pinnularia schoenfelderi were found to be the best indicators. Nitzschia vasta was the only teratogenic diatom within the dataset. However, as with other analyses, the relationship between teratogenic valves and mine impact was not significant. This study demonstrates the continued need for research in the tropics in order to better understand biological responses and enable study comparisons. Although at least one new xii species was identified, the genetic research indicated that taxonomic texts produced for northern hemisphere regions can be applied to tropical diatom taxa as long as the risk of taxonomic force fitting is avoided. Additionally, the benefit of diatoms as biological monitors varies depending on the method utilised. In these highly impacted systems, transfer functions produced the strongest results. In contrast, it is evident that the abundance and distribution of teratological forms of diatoms are poor indicators of impact. Further work culturing diatoms and combining this technique with ecotoxicological work will help verify autecologies of taxa and their responses to co-varying pollutants. This will strengthen use of diatom taxa as indicator species. Continued monitoring of these sites can add much to our ecological understanding of these highly impacted systems which, in turn, will lead to better management of the systems for both sustainable resource development and conservation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diatoms; monitoring; pollution; classification; Northern Territory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58441</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic wave propagation and modelling in poro-elastic media with mesoscopic inhomogeneities.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Liu</field><field name="description">Biot's theory when applied to homogeneous media (involving the macroscopic flow mechanism) cannot explain the high level of attenuation observed in natural porous media over the seismic frequency range. However, several successful mesocopic inhomogeneity models have been developed to account for P wave attenuation. In this thesis I further develop the approaches to tackle S wave velocity and attenuation, to simulate transient wave propagation in poroelastic media, and to construct new models for determining the effective parameters of porous media containing mesoscopic inhomogeneities. As an important application of the double-porosity dual-permeability (DPDP) model, I have reformulated the effective Biot model using the total-field variables. This gives rise to new and more general governing equations than the previous approach based on the host phase field variables (which become a special case of the more general treatment). The analytical transient solution and dispersion characteristics for the double-porosity model and also for a poro-viscoacoustic model are derived over the entire frequency range for a homogeneous medium. The comparison between the results of the two models shows that dissipation by local mesoscopic flow of the double porosity model is very hard to fit by a single Zener element over a broad band. I chose the relaxation function to approximate the dispersion behaviour of the double porosity model just around the source centre frequency. It is shown that for most water-filled sandstones having a double porosity structure, wave propagation can be well described by the poro-viscoaoustic model with a single Zener element in the seismic frequency range. The transient solution for heterogeneous double porosity media is obtained by a numerical pseudospectral time splitting technique. This method is extended to 2.5-D poro-viscoelastic media to capture both P and S wave behaviour. I also demonstrate that if the frequency is below several Hz, then a single Kelvin-Voigt element gives an even better result than a single Zener element. I propose a two-phase permeability spherical inclusion model and obtain the dispersion curves of phase velocity and dissipation factor for the composite. I then determine the effective dynamic permeability of porous media with mesoscopic heterogeneities over the whole frequency range. This result is used to check the validity of other measures of effective dynamic permeability, deduced from the effective hydraulic permeability by replacing the permeability of the components with their dynamic values as determined from the Johnson, Koplik and Dashen (JKD) model. I also investigate the scattering of plane transverse waves by a spherical porous inclusion embedded in an infinite poroelastic medium. The vector displacement wave equations of Biot&#8217;s theory are solved as an infinite series of vector spherical harmonics for the case of a plane S-wave incidence. Then, the non-self-consistent theory is used to derive the dispersion characteristics of shear wave velocity and attenuation for a porous rock having mesoscopic spherical inclusions which are designed to represent either the patchy saturation model or the double porosity model with dilute concentrations of identical inclusions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poro-elasticity; wave propagation; seismic attenuation; permeability and porosity; numerical solutions; wave scattering and diffraction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58442</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Management of boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera) (L.) T. Norl. using fire, herbicides and other techniques in Australian woodlands.</field><field name="creator">Melland, Rachel L.</field><field name="description">Invasive plants cause ecosystem degradation throughout the world, including the reduction of native plant density and diversity, and changes in ecosystem structure and function. Woody weeds often grow faster than native species and in invaded habitats produce larger and/or more seed and outshade other mid- and under-storey species. Boneseed Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera (L.) T. Norl. has caused the degradation of many temperate woodlands in Australia and has not yet reached its full potential distribution in this country. The control of this weed is therefore a high priority in Australia. Biological control agents have not controlled boneseed populations to date and no detailed integrated control strategies exist for different densities of mature boneseed plants and soil seed banks in native vegetation of varying levels of degradation. Fire, herbicides and manual plant removal have previously been used to control boneseed; however, substantial landscape scale control has not yet been achieved. Boneseed population control experiments were undertaken in two temperate woodlands in Victoria, Australia. In highly degraded temperate grassy woodlands at the You Yangs Regional Park west of Melbourne in Victoria and in a highly diverse native closed woodland at Arthurs Seat State Park in south-eastern Victoria. Several combinations of the weed control techniques of fire, herbicide application, hand-pulling of seedlings and distribution of competitive native grasses were found to control both mature boneseed populations and the large reserves of viable boneseed seeds in the soil. The efficacy of controlled burning, and the combination and timing of control techniques were found to vary according to differing densities of boneseed plants, viable soil seed banks and post-fire emergent seedlings. Where sufficient fine fuel existed, a warm, even, autumn burn consumed above ground biomass, killed the majority of viable boneseed seed in the soil, and caused the remaining boneseed seed to germinate. Spraying with glyphosate herbicide was as effective as metsulfuron-methyl herbicide for killing boneseed seedlings along with the secondary climbing weed Billardiera heterophylla (Lindl.) L.W.Cayzer &amp; Crisp after fire. However, the use of glyphosate also killed all native species, resulting in bare ground. After fire in species rich vegetation, boneseed was eliminated where seed of the native C3 grass Poa sieberiana Spreng. had been broadcast onto the post fire ash-bed, and seedlings had been sprayed five months after the burn or where seedlings had been sprayed 12 months after burning. Boneseed control occurred when seedlings were sprayed five months after the burn. In degraded vegetation few boneseed seedlings remained where seedlings were sprayed 17 months after fire. Where insufficient rainfall occurred, hand-pulling flowering boneseed seedlings prevented new seed fall for 6 to 12 months. Suggestions are made for the integration of these methods with the establishment and proliferation of biological control agents. A new protocol for utilising several integrated control strategies for boneseed and other woody weeds in a mosaic at both the site and landscape scale is described. A mosaic would allow for a variety of native species responses to fire and other control methods and thus lead to heterogeneous ages and structures within the native vegetation following weed control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Weed control; Boneseed; Woody; Ecology; Fire; Herbicide; Temperate woodland; Mediterranean; Asteracae; Chrysanthemoides monilifera; Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58443</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular systematics of the Lomandra Labill. Complex (Asparagales: Laxmanniaceae).</field><field name="creator">Donnon, Matthew J.</field><field name="description">The &#8220;Lomandra complex&#8221; (or Lomandra grouping) is an informally recognised grade resulting from the subdivision of the Laxmanniaceae into two groups (Conran, 1998); the &#8216;Lomandra complex&#8221; (Acanthocarpus, Chamaexeros, Lomandra, Romnalda and Xerolirion), and the remainder as the Arthropodoids (Arthropodium, Chamaescilla, Cordyline, Eustrephus, Laxmannia, Murchisonia, Sowerbaea, Thysanotus and Trichopetalum). Laxmanniaceae are an Australiacentred, tropical to temperate family of 14 genera with around 180 species from Australasia, SE Asia, the Mascarenes, New Caledonia, New Guinea, New Zealand, North and South America and the Pacific Islands. There have been no detailed phylogenetic studies in Laxmanniaceae and the relationships within and between the genera is poorly understood. This study utilised molecular data from chloroplast trnL-F and nuclear ribosomal ITS2 regions analysed with maximum parsimony and bayesian inference methods to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genera of the &#8216;Lomandra complex&#8217;, using species of Arthropodium, Eustrephus, Laxmannia and Thysanotus as outgroups. The molecular phylogeny shows that Lomandra forms four primary clades; with members from the classical anatomy, inflorescence-defined section and series distributed amongst these, typically in large islands. The monotypic genus Xerolirion resides deeply within Lomandra, raising questions about the appropriateness of this genus. Additionally, the other genera of the Lomandra complex (Acanthocarpus, Chamaexeros and Romnalda) form a clade positioned sister to one of four primary Lomandra clades, but nested inside Lomandra sens. lat., indicating a closer relationship between these genera than previously thought. The affiliation of these bisexual, hermaphroditic genera within the otherwise unisexual, dioecious Lomandra clade supports the recognition of the &#8216;Lomandra complex&#8217; as an expanded genus, Lomandra; and represents either an example of the evolution of unisexuality followed by reversion, or else multiple losses of hermaphrodite flowers. Morphological and anatomical data were obtained for leaf and floral macroscopic characters, mid-leaf section anatomy and cuticle microscopic features and analysed with maximum parsimony and bayesian inference methods to reconstruct the anatomical phylogeny. These data were also utilised to generate a DELTA key for identifying species of Lomandra from a combination of macroscopic morphological and microscopic leaf anatomical features.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lomandra; Molecular systematic; ITS, trnL; PAUP*; MrBayes; Leaf anatomy; Inflorescence anatomy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58444</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReFashion reDunn : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Janet</field><field name="description">This study arises out of the researcher&#8217;s experience in the fields of costume and fashion. It develops, through design practice and reflection, a design process for fashion wear made from post-consumer recycled materials. Theoretical analysis provides global, historical, philosophical and design contexts within which to develop an ethos for this variant form of fashion wear designated ReFashion. Differences in design process between conventional fashion and ReFashion are detailed to highlight the significance of provenance of materials in the light of a perceived need to slow down clothing production and consumption. This perception is informed by scientific predictions that failure to engage with urgently needed changes to the prevalent economic paradigm will result in planet earth reaching a tipping point with potentially disastrous results for its inhabitants. Fundamental to the ReFashion ethos is preparedness for a speculative post-apocalyptic future that might render the fashion system unable to operate as it currently does, necessitating a more self-sufficient approach to clothing needs, with an accompanying shift in perceptions of what is deemed fashionable. The theme Survivalist Fantasy provides a lens to bring conceptual and material aspects of the work into focus.

The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making space : speleology : an exegesis presented with exhibition as fulfillment of the requirements for thesis : Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Torrington, Sian</field><field name="description">This essay documents a year of exploring how to continue to be creative, experimental and intuitive within an art institution. It provides a context and thus academic shelter for a non-linear, experimental process of making drawings, sculpture and site-specific work. The essay has three layers; the contextual document, images which show the process of making, as well as a narrative written in experimental poetry which describes the embodied process of making through collaged journal writing. The images are interspersed through the essay, while the poetry provides an alternative narrative and is printed on the back pages of the essay. &#8216;Building&#8217; is used as an active metaphor for the creative process, as well as buildings as sites for research and installation of adaptive sculptures. Building as a metaphor for unchanging narratives will be contrasted with artists whose work challenges the unitary nature of a functional building through their interventions. Using the body to make meaning is discussed in a feminist context, as an alternative this model to linear, rational thinking. This also questions and problematizes the heroic male artist body. Performing the making through a female body will be discussed and issues of privacy and proximity covered. A potential solution to these issues will be explored in using abstraction to create active meaning, thus implicating the body of the audience as well as the artist.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experimental poetry</field><field name="subject">Creative process</field><field name="subject">Feminism in art</field><field name="subject">Experimental art</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1332</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motivation for change in the discipline of children : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Social Work, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Madgeskind, Sharon Mary</field><field name="description">Since becoming the first English speaking country to legislate against the physical discipline of children in 2007, there has been much debate in New Zealand for and against the parental practice of smacking. For some it has meant a welcome amendment to legislation that protects the human rights of children, for others it raises fears that parents can be criminalised for smacking their children and that the rights of parents to discipline their child, as they see fit, are being eroded. Working for an organisation that fully supports the Amendment to Section 59 of the Crimes Act, 1961 and that promotes the human rights of children; the motivating factors that encourage a parent to stop the practice of physically disciplining their child became of interest to the researcher for this thesis. Ten participants, who had used physical discipline and who had made a decision to stop the practice, were recruited to take part in a qualitative study. The data collected was analysed through a thematic analysis process using five motivational contexts found in previous research on the topic. The five contexts were experiential, relational, biographical, regulatory and ideological (Davis, 1999). The findings of the research for this thesis concur with the previous research and add further information about the motivating factors. The findings also identify the strategies that parents have found useful to achieve success in their endeavour to change their disciplinary practice. Furthermore the importance of and the distinction between the human rights of the child and parental rights have been highlighted.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporal punishment</field><field name="subject">Physical discipline</field><field name="subject">Smacking</field><field name="subject">Child discipline</field><field name="subject">Social change</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370203 Social policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1333</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic relationships between milk protein percentage, reproductive performance and body condition score in Irish dairy cattle : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Sciences (MSc) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Yang, Linna</field><field name="description">A positive phenotypic correlation between milk protein percentage and reproductive performance in dairy cattle, especially during early lactation has been recently reported. The objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between milk protein percentage and different measures of fertility in Irish, seasonal calving, dairy cattle using data from experiments comparing strains of Holstein-Friesian cows under different feeding systems. The relationships between body condition score, milk production and fertility were also investigated.  The data used in this study consisted of 584 lactation records over a 5-yr period. Principal component analysis and logistic regression was used to study the relationship between milk protein percentage and fertility performance of the cow. Greater milk protein percentage during the first 60 days post-calving was associated with better reproductive performance. The probability of a cow being submitted in the first 21 days of the breeding season increased with increased milk protein percentage during early lactation. Similarly, the probability of a cow becoming pregnant to its first service or to the whole breeding season also increased. Cows were classified as either high or low milk protein percentage based on their protein percentage over the whole lactation. Cows in the high milk protein group had a 7% greater conception rate compared to cows in the low protein percentage group. In conclusion, cows with higher protein percentage, especially during early lactation are submitted earlier in the breeding season, and have a higher conception rate. Physiologically, the shortage of glucose caused by negative energy balance restricts the synthesis of milk protein in the udder. On the other side, negative energy balance also causes the reduction of IGF-I, LH and oestradiol, which consequently delay the ovarian follicular development and finally reduces fertility. Therefore, there is a biological explanation for the association between milk protein percentage and fertility performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk protein percentage</field><field name="subject">Dairy cattle reproduction</field><field name="subject">Holstein-Friesian cows</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300402 Animal reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1337</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whole body vibration training for multiple sclerosis patients : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment for the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Exercise and Sport Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mason, Rachael Ruth</field><field name="description">Introduction: The purpose of this study was firstly to investigate whether 8 weeks of whole body vibration (WBV) training was an acceptable form of exercise for patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and secondly what effect it may have on measures of functional capacity. Methods: Fifteen participants with MS volunteered for WBV training three times a week on a commercialised Galileo Sport&#8482; vibration machine with an oscillating platform. Training consisted of two four week blocks based on an increasing stimulus training programme (overload principle). The first fours weeks involving five sets of 1-min WBV with 1-min rest in between with increasing vibration frequency (15-25Hz, 2.6mm-4.1mm amplitude); the second four weeks training increased to eight sets of 1-min WBV (15-20Hz, 6.1mm amplitude). Functional performance measures (Timed up and Go, Standing Balance, Functional Reach and Timed walk) and quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) were conducted prior to training, at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 2 weeks (10wk) following the completion of the training. Results: The 10m walk test showed significant improvements at the 2m, 8m and 10m measure between pre vs. 8wk (P&lt;0.05) and pre vs.10wk (P&lt;0.05). Timed up and Go demonstrated a significant time effect (P&lt;0.05). Standing balance showed significant improvements at pre and 4 week (p&lt;0.05) and pre and 10 week (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate WBV as an exercise training modality for MS patients. It was shown that not only is WBV training safe, well tolerated by MS patients but it also improved standing balance and walking speed in MS patients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiple sclerosis patients</field><field name="subject">Whole body vibration training (WBV)</field><field name="subject">Exercise therapy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321400 Human Movement and Sports Science::321499 Human movement and sports science (not elsewhere classified)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1336</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phosphate rock fertilisers to enhance soil P status and P nutrition on organic cropping farms : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Plant Science at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Scott Robert</field><field name="description">The soils used by the East Coast Organic Producers Trust (ECOPT; the grower group that this study is targeted towards) have exceptionally low soil Olsen P concentrations (ca. 6 mg/L). These and other limitations (e.g. poor weed and pest and disease control) result in many ECOPT growers being unable to produce economic yields on anything other than small scale gardens. Fertilisers and manures are seldom used by these growers, which exacerbates the problem. Thus, the object of this research was to provide information to ECOPT on which fertilisers and application strategies would provide the best returns on their phosphorus (P) fertiliser investment. The experimental work was carried out in two parts. A laboratory study tested a range of phosphate rock (PR) based fertilisers and application rates; Ben Guerir reactive phosphate rock (RPR; 67, 133, 267, 533 and 1,333 mg P/kg soil), BioPhos and BioSuper (267 and 1,333 mg P/kg soil) and a no fertiliser Control. Soil fertiliser mixtures were incubated for 155 days and periodic measurements of PR dissolution, soil pH and Bic-P (analogous to Olsen P but expressed in &#181;g/g) were undertaken. The field study used fewer application rates and two application methods; banded and broadcast. Broadcast plots were applied at 678 mg P/kg soil (488 kg P/ha); banded RPR was applied at 236, 678 and 1475 mg P/kg soil (40, 115 and 250 kg P/ha respectively) and banded BioPhos and BioSuper at 678 mg P/kg soil (115 kg P/ha). A Control was also included. Fertilisers were applied in October 2004 and changes in soil pH and Bic-P were measured in the broadcast plots only over a 344 day period. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Desiree) was the test crop. Regression analysis was used to generate exponential equations to describe the changes in Bic-P over time (&#8710;Bic-P). Differences between fertilisers in the amount of P dissolved and pH fluxes were used to explain the differences in &#8710;Bic-P. BioSuper dissolved quicker and generated greater &#8710;Bic-P than RPR and BioPhos, which were similar. Higher application rates produced greater increases in Bic-P than lower rates but decreased the % of P applied that dissolved. The increase in Bic-P over time from fertiliser application was much slower in the field compared with the laboratory. This was put down to differences in experimental conditions; mainly soil pH and soil aggregate surface area. Potato tuber yield (mean = 35 t/ha) did not respond to any of the fertiliser treatments despite a significant increase in P concentration of the shoots mid-way through the season in all broadcast treatments (shoot P concentration was not analysed in the banded plots). Water and N availability were the main limiting factors in this season as the crop was not irrigated and soil N supply was insufficient to produce a full canopy. Phosphorus response curves generated using the fertiliser response model PARJIB (Reid, 2002), and an economic analysis, indicated that for RPR and BioPhos the optimum economic application rate was 200 kg P/ha and for BioSuper it was 100 kg P/ha (applied every third and second year respectively).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphate rock fertilisers</field><field name="subject">Organic farming</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus fertiliser</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The logistics of milk collection : an exploratory case study between New Zealand and Brazil : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of requirements for a degree of Master in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Massey University, Palmerston North Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pimenta, Luis Carlos Queiroz</field><field name="description">Logistics has became one of the most important activities for all companies where has been treated as strategic function to gain competitive advantage over a companies' competitors. Agribusiness as any other business is also using logistics tools in their supply chain to reduce their chain cost and more important to improve their business efficiency as a whole. Transportation is one of the logistics activities that most influences price of product which in some cases can represent 25% of the final price. Milk collection for a dairy business plays an important part in the overall performance of the company. A poor milk collection system jeopardise the entire chain as it is the first stage of the manufacturing process. The main purpose of this work is to identify and describe the possible differences and similarities between a Brazilian and New Zealand Dairy Company regarding their logistics of milk collection. Even though the two companies are in the same business segment they are inserted in different environments/markets therefore need to deal with different issues regarding milk collection such as companies' structure, milk production's cycle, and routing and scheduling applications. However, both understand the importance of the logistics activities and apply tools in their chain to improve their efficiency. Due to its size and market share the New Zealand Company has a better collection system in place than the Brazilian Company. Both have implemented some changes in the last few years that brought some improvements for their milk collection.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Logistics</field><field name="subject">Milk collection</field><field name="subject">Dairy industry</field><field name="subject">Agribusiness</field><field name="subject">Brazil</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1334</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metaphors of menopause in medicine : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Niland, Patricia Ruth</field><field name="description">Medical textbooks have previously represented women&#8217;s bodies and menopause life transitions by using notions of &#8216;machine productivity&#8217; and &#8216;machine breakdown&#8217; (Martin, 1987). This study aimed to explore whether these representations have changed, especially given recent HRT clinical trial results. Eight relevant compulsory medical textbooks for first and second year medical students at two New Zealand Universities were identified. A Foucauldian discourse analysis (Parker, 1990) was undertaken on relevant content to identify representations of menopause, HRT, women&#8217;s bodies, and ageing. Five major discourses were employed in the textbooks in descriptions of menopause and HRT: failure, estrogen deficiency as disease; HRT as saviour; obscurity and the new discovery discourse. Menopause continues to be represented as resulting from a &#8216;failure&#8217; of a machine-like body. Although the recent HRT clinical trials were reported as a serious risk factor in half of the textbooks, HRT was also represented as a saviour particularly against postmenopausal osteoporosis. The discovery of &#8216;new&#8217; drugs to &#8216;treat&#8217; HRT and the &#8216;postmenopausal&#8217; patient were heralded with much excitement. Medical textbooks continue to use failure discourses to describe women&#8217;s bodies at menopause. New risk-based HRT assessments for &#8216;patients&#8217; with menopause &#8216;symptoms&#8217; are promoted. These portrayals reinforce linear and reductionist ways of thinking about menopause and women at midlife and provide few spaces for resistance or alternative constructions to more accurately reflect women&#8217;s embodied worlds.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Menopause</field><field name="subject">Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Health psychology</field><field name="subject">Foucauldian discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1338</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing power balance in matrix organizations.</field><field name="creator">Saracoglu, Nursen Emine</field><field name="description">Modern organizations require new structural forms to cope with uncertainties arising from the challenges of global competition and rapid technological and environmental changes (Clarke and Clegg, 1998). One of the most important developments in the area of planned change has been on how to work with large systems so as to initiate and sustain change over time. It was from such contexts that the matrix concept emerged. During the 1950s the term matrix emerged in the United States aerospace industry and, as it has developed through the years, the term has come to be accepted in both business and academic circles. In the 1960s the matrix was sought as a fundamental alternative for dealing with unique management problems of coordination, communication and control (Davis and Lawrence, 1977). In the 1970s and 1980s interest in matrix organizational structures peaked. Since that time, research and literature on the matrix has diminished; contrarily, organizations continue to adopt the matrix as a viable alternative to deal with their increasingly complex business environment. In the recent past, some of the companies that applied a complex global matrix structure have included Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), Zurich (1991); Brown &amp; Root (BR), UK (1999); Hatch (1999) &#8211; Formerly BHPE and Kaiser mergers; IMC (1999); Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), (1999); and Sinclair Knight and Merz (SKM), (2002). These companies have used matrix structures to achieve worldwide economies of scale, combined with local flexibility and responsiveness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure, with a focus that includes identifying: i. The key factors behind the strategic decision to change the corporate organization in international companies to a matrix structure. ii. The weaknesses and strengths of these matrix structures for subsequent organizational performance. iii. The effects of transition to matrix structure on organizational performance. iv. The factors used to maintain a power balance between divisions. v. A model that seeks to diminish or reduce matrix structure weaknesses to increase organizational effectiveness. The research was conducted in the form of a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews. To illustrate the implementation of the matrix structure that occurred in a real world environment, SKM has been researched as an intensive case study. Preface As a professional engineer I have had opportunities to be involved with major projects in various international organizations. I have also had opportunities to observe organizations and to analyse their operations by exploring existing procedures and manuals. It was noticeable that the overall success of the projects relied very much on organizational decision making. This observation led my paradigm shift from projects to organizational studies and to the idea of conducting research that aims to investigate the weaknesses and strengths of matrix structures for organizational performance. Introduction Thesis structure This thesis presents a detailed account of the research activities undertaken by Nursen Saracoglu and the outcomes of that research. The purpose of this research is to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure. Data has been collected using a combination of methods, including questionnaires, semistructured interviews, and direct examination of library catalogues and databases. The structure of this thesis is designed as follows: Chapter 1 introduces, and describes the background to the research project. The theories that provide a background to the various factors involved in organizations choosing to change to matrix structures, and the resulting positive and negative effects on the organization, are presented in this chapter. Chapters 2 reviews and analyses the literature review that has been conducted to focus, especially, on how changes to the structure and design of power in matrix organizations can have important implications and consequences. The literature review looks in detail at different organizational theories, particularly theories on power within organizations, which have a bearing on the effect of a matrix structure on an organization. Each theory is critiqued in terms of its relevance to matrix structure analysis. Strategic Contingencies Theory (SCT) and Resource Dependency Theory (RDT) best explain the effect of different levels of power inside a matrix structure. Chapter 3 details the research design and methodology. This chapter describes the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative and qualitative approaches and presents the rationale of selecting research methodology. The participating organization, SKM, is described in terms of its history and its matrix structure is outlined. Chapter 4 illustrates the results of research that defines potential areas of concern associated with matrix structures. The discussion mainly centres on the methods used to analyse the data and then focuses on the different dependent and independent variables derived from the data that are used in the analysis for correlation purposes. The aim of this chapter is to explain the various statistics used to analyse the data and to list the variables that came up as a result of answers to questionnaire. These variables are then analysed against each other in order to develop a sense of the effectiveness of the matrix structure in SKM. In Chapter 5 the qualitative data was examined using the responses obtained from interviews with the top managers of SKM. This chapter aims to identify the themes that have emerged from these interview responses and present them in order of most to least common within each area of research, illustrated with comments from some of the respondents. Chapter 6 discusses the survey and interview results in order to exploit quantitative findings to identify patterning in qualitative data. In parallel with SCT and RDT, the relationship between power and performance in matrix organizations is presented. The new concepts that emerged based on the research findings are introduced and discussed according to the relevance to the research objectives. Chapter 7 This chapter concludes the research and presents research limitations, boundaries, the contribution to the body of knowledge and a summary of future research opportunities. The case studies give a sense of how various elements of Matrix structure that outlined in this research were actually applied by other particular organizations are exhibited in Appendix A.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behaviour.</field><field name="subject">Organizational change.</field><field name="subject">Matrix organization.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1073</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opening the black box of guideline implementation : primary health care nurses use of a guideline for cardiovascular risk.</field><field name="creator">McKillop, Ann Margaret</field><field name="description">The implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in primary health care can substantially improve health promotion, early disease detection and the reduction of the burden of chronic disease. However, the implementation of evidence into clinical practice is a highly complex endeavour that has been said to occur in a 'black box&#8216;, defying easily reached explanations of how it happens in practice. The aim of this study is to explore the 'black box&#8216; of guideline implementation associated with primary health care nurses&#8216; use of a guideline that targets high health need populations in a region of New Zealand. The potential for improvement of cardiovascular health overall and the reduction of the marked disparities between M&#228;ori (indigenous people of New Zealand) and non-M&#228;ori drives the imperative to enact the recommendations of the Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. Primary health care nurses are well positioned at the frontline of healthcare to implement the guideline and an investigation of the realities of their practice as they do so will help to illuminate the contents of this particular 'black box&#8216;. The aim is achieved in two components by: 1. Exploring the complexities of primary health care nurses&#8216; use of the New Zealand Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. 2. Employing the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework to identify the enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in the primary health care setting. Method Both components of this study involve qualitative methods. The first component involves qualitative description utilising focus groups and interviews to explore the perceptions and experiences of a range of primary health care professionals involved in implementing the AMCVR guideline and thematic analysis of data. The second component utilises template analysis of the data, based on the Promoting Action of Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework. There are three elements of the PARiHS framework: Evidence, Context and Facilitation. This second component of the study is a systematic analysis of the enablers and barriers encountered by nurses as they implement the AMCVR guideline. Results The first component of the study generated four themes, which together have provided a rich portrait of the realities for nurses as they implemented the guideline. The four themes are self-managing client, everyday nursing practice, developing new relationships in the health team, and impact on health care delivery. The template analysis revealed that there were several enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in relation to Evidence and Context and that Facilitation was not occurring in a planned way. Conclusion Successful guideline implementation demands multidisciplinary, transformational practice development to create an effective workplace culture. Practice development is a powerful approach well suited to supporting primary health care nurses to maximise their practice-based knowledge and skills, and for them to contribute to the development of systems that will meet the information and communication requirements of successful guideline implementation. The imperative to improve cardiovascular health overall and specifically to address M&#228;ori health inequity mandates sustained effort and mobilisation of resources to ensure successful implementation of the AMCVR guideline.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative description.</field><field name="subject">Clinical practice guidelines.</field><field name="subject">Primary health care.</field><field name="subject">Implementation of evidence.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1074</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The water-energy nexus : a comprehensive analysis in the context of New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Debborah</field><field name="description">Water and electricity are fundamentally linked. Policy reforms in both industries, however, do not appear to acknowledge the links nor consider their wider implications. This is clearly unhelpful, particularly as policy makers attempt to develop effective responses to water and energy issues, underpinned by prevailing drought conditions and impending climate change. Against this backdrop, this research has comprehensively analysed the links between water and electricity &#8211; termed water-energy nexus &#8211; in the context of New South Wales. For this purpose, this research has developed an integrated methodological framework. The philosophical guidance for the development of this framework is provided by Integral Theory, and its analytical foundations rest on a suite of research methods including historical analysis, inputoutput analysis, analysis of price elasticities, and long-term scenario analysis. This research suggests that the historical and inextricable links between water and electricity, in the absence of integrated policies, has given rise to water-energy trade-offs. In the electricity industry, water-intensive coal-fired power stations that dominate base-load capacity in the National Electricity Market has resulted in intra- and inter-jurisdictional water sharing tradeoffs. Intermediate and peak demand technologies, suchas gas-fired, cogeneration and renewables, however, would significantly reduce the industry&#8217;s water consumption and carbon emissions. Drought and climate change adaptation responses in the water industry are likely to further increase electricity demand andpotentially contribute to climate change, due to policies that encourage investment in energy-intensive technologies, such as desalination, advanced wastewater treatment and rainwater tanks. Increasing electricity costs due to water shortages and the introduction of emissions trading will futher increase water and electricity prices for end users. Demand management strategies in both industries will assist in curbing price increases, however, their effectiveness is lessened by investment in water- and energy-intensive technologies in both industries. The analysis also demonstrates that strategies to reduce water and electricity consumption of &#8216;other&#8217; production sectors in New South Wales is overwhelmingly dependent on how deeply a particular sector is embedded in the economy, in terms of its contribution to economic output, income generation and employment growth. Regulation, demand management programs, and water pricing policies, for example, that reduce the water and energy intensity of agriculture and key manufacturing sectors are likely to benefit the wider economy and the Environment. The future implications of the water-energy nexus are examined through long-term scenario analysis for New South Wales for 2031. The analysis demonstrates how policy decisions shape the domain for making philosophical choices by society - in terms of the balance between relying on alternative technologies and market arrangements, with differing implications for water and electricity use, and for instigating behavioural change. Based on these findings, this research puts forward a range of recommendations, essentially arguing for reorienting existing institutional arrangements, government measures and industry activities in a way that would encourage integration between the water and energy policies. Although the context of this research is New South Wales, the findings are equally relevant for other Australian states, which share the same national water and energy policy frameworks. Further, the concepts and frameworks developed in this research are also of value to other countries and regions that are faced with the task of designing appropriate policy responses to redress their water and energy challenges.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power consumption.</field><field name="subject">Water-energy nexus.</field><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Water consumption.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1075</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural electrification in East Timor: the development impact of solar home systems</field><field name="creator">Bond, Mathew Robert Peter</field><field name="description">East Timor is rebuilding its stock of infrastructure after decades of underdevelopment and a wave of violent destruction in 1999. As part of this process the Government of East Timor aims to improve access to electricity from less than five percent of the population today to eighty percent by 2020. An important strategy to meeting this aim will be the use of solar home systems (SHS) in remote rural locations. To develop its policy for the deployment of SHS, the Government of East Timor must decide what size of SHS is optimal.

It examines the personal and cultural importance of an attachment to place, focusing on the reciprocal relationship between cultural heritage and a sense of place. Place is constructed out of mutual meanings between people and their environment. The study begins with an indepth look at the theory of place. In a series of heritage management case studies, the theory is applied in order to illustrate how meanings of place may be expressed. Place as a normative concept provides a role for resource managers in finding the meanings people associate with places, and in nurturing and enhancing these meanings. This involves the recognition of different values and 'stories' that are associated with place. Recognising these differences helps shift resource management away from the simplicity of grand narratives and totalizing discourses, towards a respect for intangible and multiple meanings in place.  To a certain extent an understanding of place is already informing both natural and cultural management decisions in New Zealand, although this may not be explicitly recognised. To approach cultural heritage management from the perspective of place, however, challenges the current directions that heritage management is taking in this country. The study proposes a way of taking up that challenge, and concludes that the importance of place should not be overlooked.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">theory of place</field><field name="subject">heritage management</field><field name="subject">cultural management</field><field name="subject">landscapes of place</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380101 Sensory processes perception and performance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310102 Heritage and conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1701</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions</field><field name="creator">Russell, Benjamin Gallard, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Odour plays an important role in many predator/prey interactions. In the northern hemisphere, many mammalian prey species have been shown to respond to predator odours. It is also widely assumed that mammalian predators utilise odours to locate their prey. This thesis explores the importance of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions. Responses of native Australian species to the faecal odour of two predators; the native tiger quoll Dasyurus maculatus and the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes, were evaluated through live-trapping and focussed behavioural studies of captive animals. Tiger quoll responses to prey olfactory cues were investigated in a captive experiment. Native rodents (bush rats Rattus fuscipes, swamp rats R. lutreolus and eastern chestnut mice Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) equally avoided traps scented with either quoll or fox faeces, and in captive experiments, bush rats and swamp rats reduced their average speed in response to both predator odours. Of the marsupial species, northern brown bandicoots Isoodon macrourus and common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula were captured more frequently in quoll-scented traps than unscented traps or foxscented traps, while captures of brown antechinus Antechinus stuarttii, long-nosed bandicoots Perameles nasuta and southern brown bandicoot I. obesulus were unaffected by the either predator odour. In captive experiments, brown antechinus, long-nosed and northern brown bandicoots decreased their foraging in response to both predator odours, and spent less time in areas scented with quoll faeces. Tiger quolls didn't appear to detect odour sources from a distance of &gt;65 cm, but they did follow scent trails and spent more time in areas scented with the urine and faeces of potential prey. Chemical analysis revealed no common components in fox and quoll odour which prey species could be responding to. Therefore, these native species have evolved to respond to fox odour since foxes were introduced to Australia 130 years ago. The stronger response of native rodents to fox odour may be a legacy of their co-evolution with canid predators prior to entering Australia. A better understanding of how odour is utilised in Australian predator/prey interactions may lead to a greater ability to protect Australia's unique mammalian fauna from introduced predators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Predatory animals - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Spotted-tailed quoll - Ecology - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Red fox - Ecology - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Rodents - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Brown antechinus - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Bandicoots - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Smell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25144</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental and theoretical investigation for the machining of hardened alloy steels</field><field name="creator">Lee, Tae-Hong, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research work in this thesis involves an experimental and theoretical investigation for high speed machining of AISI 4140 medium carbon steels and AISI D2 tool steels which are classified as being difficult to machine materials. An experimental program was carried out to determine the cutting forces, chip formation, the secondary deformation zone thickness and surface roughness at different cutting speeds using a 0.4mm and 0.8mm nose radii ceramic tools and -7?? rake angle for annealed (virgin) AISI 4140 and heat treated AISI 4140 steel. Another series of experiments was carried out on the annealed (virgin) and heat treated AISI D2 with 0.4mm, 0.8mm and 1.2mm nose radii CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) tools under various cutting conditions.  A theoretical model is developed by taking into account the flow stress properties of the AISI 4140 (0.44% carbon content) to use with the Oxley Machining approach. To find the flow stress data for AISI D2 tool steel, the Johnson and Cook empirical constitutive equation is used as the constitutive model. In addition, the magnitude of tool radius should be also considered to determine the prediction of cutting performances. To account for the effect of nose radius edge in hard machining, a simplified geometrical method is used to model the parameters for application in the Oxley Model and works for the cutting conditions considered here. These extensions to the Oxley machining theory were verified by experimental results. These results show a good agreement between the Oxley machining theory and hard machining experiment at data.

This research is aimed at achieving robust and effective dialogue management in such applications. We focus on an application, the Smart Personal Assistant (SPA), in which the user can use a variety of devices to interact with a collection of personal assistants, each specializing in a task domain. The current implementation of the SPA contains an e-mail management agent and a calendar agent that the user can interact with through a spoken dialogue and a graphical interface on PDAs. The user-system interaction is handled by a Dialogue Manager agent.  We propose an agent-based approach that makes use of a BDI agent architecture for dialogue modelling and control. The Dialogue Manager agent of the SPA acts as the central point for maintaining coherent user-system interaction and coordinating the activities of the assistants. The dialogue model consists of a set of complex but modular plans for handling communicative goals. The dialogue control flow emerges automatically as the result of the agent???s plan selection by the BDI interpreter. In addition the Dialogue Manager maintains the conversational context, the domainspecific knowledge and the user model in its internal beliefs.  We also consider the problem of dialogue adaptation in such agent-based dialogue systems. We present a novel way of integrating learning into a BDI architecture so that the agent can learn to select the most suitable plan among those applicable in the current context. This enables the Dialogue Manager agent to tailor its responses according to the conversational context and the user???s physical context, devices and preferences.  Finally, we report the evaluation results, which indicate the robustness and effectiveness of the dialogue model in handling a range of users.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spoken dialogues</field><field name="subject">dialogue management</field><field name="subject">BDI agents</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">natural language processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28241</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scratch-pad memory management for static data aggregates</field><field name="creator">Li, Lian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scratch-pad memory (SPM), a fast on-chip SRAM managed by software, is widely used in embedded systems. Compared to hardware-managed cache, SPM can be more efficient in performance, power and area cost, and has the added advantage of better time predictability. In this thesis, SPMs should be seen in a general context. For example, in stream processors, a software-managed stream register file is usually used to stage data to and from off-chip memory. In IBM's Cell architecture, each co-processor has a software-managed local store for keeping data and instructions.  SPM management is critical for SPM-based embedded systems. In this thesis, we propose two novel methodologies, the memory colouring methodology and the perfect colouring methodology, to place the static data aggregates such as arrays and structs of a program in SPM. Our methodologies are dynamic in the sense that some data aggregates can be swapped into and out of SPM during program execution. To this end, a live range splitting heuristic is introduced in order to create potential data transfer statements between SPM and off-chip memory.  The memory colouring methodology is a general-purpose compiler approach. The novelty of this approach lies in partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file then generalising existing graph colouring algorithms for register allocation to colour data aggregates. In this thesis, a scheme for partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file is introduced. This methodology is inter-procedural and therefore operates on the interference graph for the data aggregates in the whole program. Different graph colouring algorithms may give rise to different results due to live range splitting and spilling heuristics used. As a result, two representative graph colouring algorithms, George and Appel's iterative-coalescing and Park and Moon's optimistic-coalescing, are generalised and evaluated for SPM allocation.  Like memory colouring, perfect colouring is also inter-procedural. The novelty of this second methodology lies in formulating the SPM allocation problem as an interval colouring problem. The interval colouring problem is an NP problem and no widely-accepted approximation algorithms exist. The key observation is that the interference graphs for data aggregates in many embedded applications form a special class of superperfect graphs. This has led to the development of two additional SPM allocation algorithms. While differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together, both algorithms place data aggregates in SPM based on the cliques in an interference graph. In both cases, we guarantee optimally that all data aggregates in an interference graph can be placed in SPM if the given SPM size is no smaller than the chromatic number of the graph.  We have developed two memory colouring algorithms and two perfect colouring algorithms for SPM allocation. We have evaluated them using a set of embedded applications. Our results show that both methodologies are efficient and effective in handling large-scale embedded applications. While neither methodology outperforms the other consistently, perfect colouring has yielded better overall results in the set of benchmarks used in our experiments. All these algorithms are expected to be valuable. For example, they can be made available as part of the same compiler framework to assist the embedded designer with exploring a large number of optimisation opportunities for a particular embedded application.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scratch-pad memory.</field><field name="subject">Compiler.</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reuse of industrial products - a technical and economic model for decision support</field><field name="creator">Anityasari, Maria, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the field of sustainable manufacturing, a wide range of research has been carried out to attain the more effective use of natural resources and the reduction of environmental impacts during the whole product life cycle. This goal can be best achieved by promoting multiple-reuse of parts, sub-assemblies, or entire products. However, the decision toward reusing an old product depends on a variety of parameters with many uncertainties. Therefore, a comprehensive model to assess the reusability of products prior to the reuse decision is urgently needed. The objective of this research has been to develop a comprehensive assessment model, integrating technical, environmental, social, and economic aspects to evaluate the reusability of industrial products. The assessment model consists of four sub-models, which are a methodology to assess the quality and reliability of products, a model to translate the social responsibility aspect into warranty cost, a methodology to integrate environmental costs, and an economic model to accumulate total life cycle cost as the basis of the evaluation. The model also facilitates trade-offs between the factors to investigate the possibility to improve the reusability of a product. To apply the assessment model in the real business environment, a set of decisionmaking methodologies under different take-back scenarios has been developed as a guideline for manufacturers. Furthermore, as the existence of uncertainty in the reuse strategy is undeniable, a methodology to integrate uncertainties into the assessment model is also developed. The model validation, using three real cases collected from industrial partners on consumer and commercial products, has confirmed the applicability of the model to provide a useful tool to evaluate products at the end of their life cycle. The model also enables decision makers to disclose the risk associated with the decision, thus improving the quality of the decision. The results are in good agreement with the basic theory that the reuse and remanufacturing strategy is highly recommended from both environmental and economic reasons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making -- Methodology</field><field name="subject">Remanufacturing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40915</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation static liquefaction of lightly cemented sands</field><field name="creator">Elhadayri, Farj, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation was conducted on the static liquefaction  behaviour of very loose lightly cemented sands. Undrained and drained triaxial compression tests, one dimensional consolidation, high stress compression, and unconfined compression tests were performed on artificially prepared lightly cemented loose samples with cement-sand ratios of 2, 4 and 6%. Additional tests were also conducted on uncemented samples prepared at the same initial void ratio as the cemented samples. Besides the influence of degree of cementation, the effects of void ratio and confining pressure on the liquefaction potential of cemented sands were examined. The aim of this study is to make significant contribution to the understanding of static liquefaction failures in lightly cemented sands. It is shown that cementation could increase the initial stiffness and yield strength of cemented sands but its effect might decrease considerably after the peak strength because of destruction of the cementation bond. The response of cemented sands at lower cement contents was very similar to the response of loose sands and behaviour approached the response of medium to dense sands with increase in the degree of cementation. It is also shown that degree of cementation has a significant influence on liquefaction resistance. Even though the presence of small amounts of cementation did not prevent liquefaction failure, the liquefaction resistance of cemented sands generally increased for higher degrees of cementation.  The consolidation, high stress compression and unconfined compression tests demonstrated the effect of cementation in increasing both the stiffness and strength of cemented sands. The unconfined compression strength increased approximately linearly with the increase in cement content. The rate of strength gain increased with an increase in the dry density of the compacted sample, indicating that the cementation was more for denser samples.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cementation.</field><field name="subject">cemented sands.</field><field name="subject">liquefaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43104</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition</field><field name="creator">Straub, Axel, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si, grain size &gt; 1??m, no amorphous tissue) on glass is an interesting material for thin-film solar cells due to the low costs, the abundance and the non-toxic character of Si, and the properties of pc-Si like long-term stability and lateral conductance. Glass as supporting material significantly complicates the fabrication process as it limits the thermal budget and the maximum temperature. In this work, the feasibility of forming large-grained pc-Si thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition (IAD) on aluminium-induced crystallisation (AIC) seed layers (ALICIA solar cells) is investigated. IAD allows epitaxial growth at high rate, and being based on evaporation, is of low cost (high source material usage, no toxic gases involved). High-quality epitaxy on (100)-oriented Si wafer substrates is demonstrated in a non{UHV environment, to further increase its industrial appli- cability. High{rate growth and a sacrificial protective layer control contamination problems associated with the non-UHV environment. The process is then trans- ferred to AIC-seeded glass and optimised, with particular focus on the influence of the glass. Using high-temperature rapid thermal annealing and hydrogenation as post-deposition treatments, ALICIA solar cells with a 1-Sun open-circuit voltage of 420 mV are achieved. Moreover, two novel characterisation techniques are presented. One allows the fast and non-destructive assessment of the structural quality of pc-Si films using opti- cal measurements. Furthermore, `impedance analysis', a novel capacitance-voltage measurement technique based on impedance spectroscopy, is presented. It allows the reliable determination of the absorber layer doping density and the built{in potential of non-ideal p-n junction solar cells. The latter is used to investigate the influence of post{deposition treatments on the n-type absorber layer doping of ALICIA solar cells. It is found, using temperature dependent impedance analysis, that unintentional doping and defects have a strong influence on the absorber layer doping. A maximum in the short-circuit current density of ALICIA solar cells is found for phosphorus concentrations in the absorber of 1??1017 cm??3. For such ALI- CIA cells a base difusion length in the range 600 - 950nm, a short{circuit current density in the range 10 - 13.5 mA/cm2 and an energy conversion efficiency of 2.2% are obtained.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22435</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating non???pedagogical sociability of asynchronous computer supported collaborative learning environments</field><field name="creator">Abedin, Babak , Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">While technologically Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems have been considerably improved, previous studies have shown that the social aspect of CSCL is often neglected or assumed to happen automatically just by creating such virtual learning environments. Several studies on the other hand showed sociability of CSCL environments strongly relate to online learning enjoyment and effectiveness of learning. Social interactions in CSCL can be broadly categorized as pedagogical/on-task and non-pedagogical/non-task interactions. Accordingly, this thesis investigates the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL environments and primarily demonstrates that non-pedagogical/non-task interactions do occur in these environments. In addition, this thesis operationalizes the notion of non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL environments and determines factors that impact on it. A multi method approach for data collection and analysis is used. Results of a content analysis extend the Transcript Analysis Tool (TAT) instrument, the tool used for the content analysis, and show the presence and pattern of a substantial amount of nonpedagogical social exchanges occur in both virtual task-related as well as non-taskrelated spaces. The findings from the survey data, on the other hand, support the SIP theory and SIDE theory predictions and revealed that the sense of cohesion and awareness of others significantly impact on the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the perception of self-representation and perception of compatibility affect the sense of cohesion and awareness of others and indirectly contribute to the perceived non-pedagogical sociability of the environment. The findings of this thesis can be used in future research for investigating the relationship between the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL and other CSCL factors. It also provides CSCL lecturers and facilitators with a conceptual model by which sociability can be explicitly addressed in their course planning and delivery processes. From a practical point of view, this study develops and validates an instrument that guides required changes in the CSCL for improving the non-pedagogical social functionality of the environment. The findings also stress the importance of virtual spaces in CSCL design exercises in order to provide opportunities for students to have non-task discussions and to reflect on their own and others??? experiences and ideas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociability</field><field name="subject">Computer supported collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Social computing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44577</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stock return volatility surrounding management earnings forecasts</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Andrew Blair, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this study is to investigate the stock return volatility surrounding management earnings forecasts.  Disclosure by managers of expected earnings are particularly important communications, and as such, it is important to understand the capital market implications surrounding them.  In doing so, the research questions are essentially aimed at examining the stock return volatility, first, at the release of a management earnings forecast, and second, at the eventual announcement of the realised earnings for that period.  The first test investigates whether there is an increase in volatility surrounding a management earnings forecast for those firms who release them compared to a matched-firm sample of firms without a management earnings forecast at that date, and then further examines that result based on different forecast antecedents and forecast characteristics.  Next, this study tests, for firms who do release a management earnings forecast during the year, whether stock volatility is lower than firms who do not release a management earnings forecast at the eventual earnings announcement date.  In brief, the evidence using the Garman and Klass [1980] ???best analytic scale-invariant estimator??? of volatility in an Australian context, between 1993 and 2003, finds that stock return volatility is greater for bad news forecasts, forecasts of low specificity, and forecasts issued by firms perceived ex ante as being of lower credibility using both permutation analysis and modelling daily volatility.  At the earnings announcement date, however, there is no evidence that stock return volatility is lower for firms that issue management earnings forecasts during the year.  Overall, this result challenges the information asymmetry argument in the literature that disclosure will reduce volatility in the long-run.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stock Return Volatility</field><field name="subject">Disclosure</field><field name="subject">Management Earnings Forecasts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44839</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In Vitro and In Vivo neuronal differentiation capacity of human adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells</field><field name="creator">Khoo, Melissa Li Meng, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Discovery of the ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into cells of non-mesodermal tissues, particularly neuronal cells, have raised the possibility of utilising MSCs in regenerative/reparative therapies for neurological disorders.

The majority of the cyanide is consumed by minerals contained in the gold ore to produce many different cyanide soluble complexes or used in converting cyanide to other related species such as thiocyanate and cyanate. The high costs associated with cyanide and thiocyanate detoxification and excessive cyanide utilisation encountered when treating ores with high cyanide consumption constitutes a significant proportion of the overall processing costs. This study examines the possibility of recovering free cyanide from thiocyanate using a process based on the Acidification-Volatilisation-Regeneration (AVR) circuit in conjunction with a pre-concentration stage using commercially available ionexchange resin. From thermodynamic modelling based on the STABCAL program it was found that it was thermodynamically possible to recover cyanide from thiocyanate if the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate can be stopped. Addition of copper to the system found that the majority of the thiocyanate exists as copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) solid. Using ion-exchange resins can be an effective way to concentrate thiocyanate from tailing solutions or slurries. Four different models were successfully used to model the equilibria between thiocyanate and chloride on commercial ion-exchange resins. By normalising the equilibria data when applying the Mass action law the equilibria becomes independent of ionic strength within the range of concentration considered. An advantage of this is that only one unique equilibrium constant is used to describe the ion-exchange process. The electrochemical and kinetic studies showed that the reaction between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide is catalysed by hydrogen ions. Secondly under acidic conditions the rate of cyanide recovery by the AVR circuit was faster than at higher pH conditions. The overall reaction of thiocyanate with respect to the concentration of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide is an overall third order reaction. The derived third order rate expression is first order with respect to thiocyanate concentration and second order with respect to hydrogen peroxide concentration. Previous studies showed that the production of cyanide inhibits the reactions between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide, but by removing cyanide from the reaction by air stripping, this was not observed. Addition of copper to the system did not show a catalytic effect on the reaction but it was found that copper (II) ions suppresses competing reactions that occurred without affecting the reaction between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23018</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins of the banlieue rouge: politics, local government and communal identity in Arcueil and Cachan, 1919-1958.</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Jasen Lewis, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">By elucidating the origins of the banlieue rouge, a belt of communist-dominated suburbs surrounding Paris that arose during the interwar years and reached its apogee under the Fourth Republic, this thesis addresses the problem of why twentieth-century France was home to a pro-Soviet communist party with mass support. Specifically, a local study of the PCF in Arcueil and Cachan, two neighbouring communes south of Paris with divergent political evolutions since World War I, is used to discern how and why the Parti communiste fran??ais (PCF) came to exert hegemony in the working-class suburbs of Paris. After surveying the historiography of communism in France and beyond, this thesis concludes that the communist banlieue rouge was born of working-class alienation from bourgeois society that was nourished by a communist counter-society that was contingent upon the PCF???s capacity to adapt and respond to local circumstances. Using archival sources and statistical analysis, it demonstrates that in Arcueil and Cachan rapid suburbanisation and an attendant proletarianisation created the pre-conditions for the rise of the PCF. This study finds that during the interwar period the PCF rapidly emerged as an electoral force in both suburbs as it set about laying the foundations of a communist counter-society, especially in Arcueil where it won control of local government in 1935. In Arcueil, the PCF spearheaded the local Resistance movement during World War II and then under the Fourth Republic went on to consolidate a nascent communist communal identity, while in Cachan its influence fell victim to Cold War politics. The pre-conditions for the rise of communism were apparent earlier and to a greater degree in Arcueil, an industrialised, working-class suburb with long-standing radical traditions, than in the traditionally conservative Cachan. In Arcueil, the PCF was more successful than its counterpart in Cachan at exploiting an alienation that was not only part of the deep-seated historical traditions of the French working class but was also part of everyday life f or workers forced to live in miserable conditions. In suburbs such as Arcueil, suburban working-class pride at being a social outcast was conflated with communism to create a durable communist communal identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsibility and accountability in theory and practice: the truth and reconciliation commission???s investigation of human rights abuse in South Africa</field><field name="creator">Carman, Marina, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aims of the investigation conducted here are to draw out important debates in theory and in the South African social context over the concepts of responsibility and accountability for human rights abuse, and to look at how these were present within, and impacted on, discussions within and around the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC did not specifically discuss or define theoretical concepts of responsibility or accountability. However, I argue that it is possible to draw out some important features of its implicit approach ??? particularly in terms of its emphasis on collective responsibility and social context (in addition to individual responsibility), and its emphasis on moral arguments for individuals and collectives to accept responsibility and hold themselves accountable by contributing to future change. This ambitious and complex approach raised some important theoretical issues, which have been discussed and debated in the theoretical literature. These include: the relationship between individual responsibility, collective responsibility and the influence of ???the system???; the nature of collective responsibility; the nature of morality; the distinction between moral and political responsibility; and how individuals and collectives can or should be held accountable. In South Africa, these theoretical debates inter-mingled with a range of other factors, including individual and collective interests, motives and political perspectives. From an analysis of the existing literature on the TRC and original interviews conducted with key informants, I draw out three main opposing views which I argue arose in the South African social context about responsibility and accountability, and what the TRC could and should have done to address these. In a detailed analysis of the TRC???s hearings and Final Report, I draw out how theoretical debates, and these three opposing views, were present within and impacted on the TRC???s work. I argue that it was impossible for the TRC to satisfy everyone and resolve these debates, and that its approach led to unrealistic expectations of its work and its role more generally. This has impacted negatively on how the TRC was and is perceived.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23475</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANU Library - Publicly Available Digital Theses (ADT)</field><field name="creator">Australian National University, Division of Information, Library</field><field name="description">ANU Library Australian Digital Thesis Program.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Is part of Australian National University Library web site</field><field name="subject">theses, thesis, digital theses, digital thesis, ADT, Australian Digital Theses, ANU Digital Theses, ADT Program, PhD Theses</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au/templates/digtheses.dwt</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilising airborne scanning laser (LiDAR) to improve the assessment of Australian native forest structure</field><field name="creator">Lee, Alex C.</field><field name="description">Enhanced understanding of forest stocks and dynamics can be gained through improved forest measurement, which is required to assist with sustainable forest management decisions, meet Australian and international reporting needs, and improve research efforts to better respond to a changing climate.  Integrated sampling schemes that utilise a multi-scale approach, with a range of data sourced from both field and remote sensing, have been identified as a way to generate the required forest information.  Given the multi-scale approach proposed by these schemes, it is important to understand how scale potentially affects the interpretation and reporting of forest from a range of data.  
&#182;
To provide improved forest assessment at a range of scales, this research has developed a strategy for facilitating tree and stand level retrieval of structural attributes within an integrated multi-scale analysis framework.  The research investigated the use of fine-scale (~1m) airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data (1,125 ha in central Queensland, and 60,000 ha in NE Victoria) to calibrate other remotely sensed data at the two study sites.  The strategy refines forest structure mapping through three-dimensional (3D) modelling combined with empirical relationships, allowing improved estimation of maximum and predominant height, as well as foliage and crown cover at multiple scales.  Tree stems (including those in the sub-canopy) were located using a height scaled crown openness index (HSCOI), which integrated the 3D density of canopy elements within the vertical profile into a two-dimensional spatial layer.  The HSCOI modelling also facilitated the reconstruction of the 3D distribution of foliage and branches (of varying size and orientation) within the forest volume.  
&#182;  
Comparisons between forests at the Queensland and NE Victorian study sites indicated that accurate and consistent retrieval of cover and height metrics could be achieved at multiple scales, with the algorithms applicable for semi-automated use in other forests with similar structure.  This information has facilitated interpretation and evaluation of Landsat imagery and ICESat satellite laser data for forest height and canopy cover retrieval.  The development of a forest cover translation matrix allows a range of data and metrics to be compared at the plot scale, and has initiated the development of continuous transfer functions between the metrics and datasets.  These data have been used subsequently to support interpretation of SAR data, by providing valuable input to 2D and 3D radar simulation models.  Scale effects have been identified as being significant enough to influence national forest class reporting in more heterogeneous forests, thus allowing the most appropriate use and integration of remote sensed data at a range of scales.  An empirically based forest minimum mapping area of 1 ha for reporting is suggested.  The research has concluded that LiDAR can provide calibration information just as detailed and possibly more accurately than field measurements for many required forest attributes.  Therefore the use of LiDAR data offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between accurate field plot structural information and stand to landscape scale sampling, to provide enhanced forest assessment in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LiDAR</field><field name="subject">Forests</field><field name="subject">Structure</field><field name="subject">Height</field><field name="subject">Canopy density</field><field name="subject">Canopy cover</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20090127.222600</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and the Global Governance of Plant Genetic Resources</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Johanna</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the location and nature of the power that is deepening and broadening the revolution in modern biotechnologies, and which is inherent in the global governance of one type of genetic resource &#151; plant genetic resources.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost-effective Conservation Planning</field><field name="creator">Josie Carwardine</field><field name="description">Biodiversity is declining globally due to mounting anthropogenic threats. Actions to protect biodiversity against threats can be costly, involving land purchase, invasive species management, and inflicting opportunity costs of lost revenue and livelihoods in conservation areas. Governments and conservation organisations are under increasing pressure to deliver the greatest benefits from conservation funds, and to minimise conflicts between conservation and other human priorities. Most conservation planning approaches are limited in their ability to assist with cost-effective funding allocation decisions. First, approaches often lack quantifiable objectives and appropriate tools. Second, approaches rarely consider economic information, such as spatially explicit data on the costs of conservation actions. In this thesis I address these two limitations, which often co-occur, in spatial conservation planning. Problem definition includes specifying a quantifiable objective, a set of constraints and control variables, and knowledge of the system. A simple conservation objective is to protect target amounts of biodiversity features, such as 15% of the range of each species and vegetation type, over a minimal total reserve area. Here, targets are the constraints and the control variables are the decisions of whether or not to conserve each site. Target-based conservation planning is the dominant spatial prioritisation approach, but has been criticised for failing to protect untargeted portions of biodiversity and for employing targets too low to ensure species persistence. In Chapter 2, I review target-based systematic conservation planning, discovering that many perceived limitations can be overcome with current developments in research and software and better communication, whilst acknowledging the value of alternative approaches. Conservation planning objectives are becoming increasingly complex due to the need to conserve many kinds of features, such as species, habitat types, and ecosystem services. Measures of the spatial congruence between features is often used to determine if one feature is a good surrogate for representing another and whether multiple features can be easily captured in a single plan. In Chapter 3 I review the use of congruence metrics in conservation planning research, explaining the differences between the three most common metrics &#8211; spatial correlation, hotspot overlap, incidental representation &#8211; and demonstrating why high values in one metric can coincide with low values in another. Most importantly, I show that integrated systematic conservation planning, rather than congruence metrics, is the only way to determine how efficient it will be to protect multiple features in a reserve system. While conservation planning has an implicit goal of cost-efficiency, spatially explicit data on the costs of conservation action are rarely considered. Prioritisation analyses that do not consider conservation costs can lead to the misallocation of funds and high opportunity costs. In Chapter 4 I carry out a global analysis at 1&#186; resolution to identify areas that could protect targets of 10% of every mammal species&#8217; range whilst minimising the opportunity costs of forgone agricultural production. The a priori inclusion of opportunity costs reduced the cost of meeting conservation targets by at least 30%. I then compare cost-effective allocation of funds to actual funding allocation by international conservation agencies in 2006, highlighting globally important, threatened and under-funded regions. While estimates of conservation opportunity costs can increase conservation planning efficiency, there are often various actions under consideration, each with different associated costs. The definition of specific actions, and their respective costs, is rarely considered in conservation planning. In Chapter 5 I develop cost surfaces for two conservation actions in Australia (i) land purchase for reservation estimated by unimproved land values and (ii) stewardship payments to private landholders to conserve biodiversity estimated by forgone agricultural production. I then identify priority areas at a 10 km2 resolution for conserving 15% of the pre-clearing extent of a range of biodiversity features by these actions. I demonstrate that using cost data to reflect specific conservation actions minimises improves financial efficiency by up to two-fold. Cost-effective conservation planning is also hindered by uncertainties in estimates of conservation costs. In Chapter 6 I carry out the first comprehensive sensitivity analysis of conservation priorities to cost value, using the same goal as in Chapter 5, but restricting planning to reservation in Queensland, which is the Australian state with the best quality unimproved land value data. First, I show that sites which are essential or unhelpful for meeting conservation targets maintain a high and low priority status respectively, over a large range of cost data (1-400% of their estimated cost). Medium priority sites are sensitive to estimates of cost, and represent the greatest opportunities to make cost-effective decisions. Next I develop a simple approach for planning with uncertain cost data, where priorities can be updated as real information on the cost of a parcel of land becomes available. This chapter shows that uncertain cost data is useful for conservation planning. Potentially cost-effective areas for conservation actions in Australia are identified in Chapters 5 and 6. My final chapter serves to synthesise and interpret this research. Through comprehensive analyses, I have shown that cost-effective conservation planning requires the definition of appropriate objectives and tools, and the integration of conservation costs. Further, I have demonstrated accessible approaches that integrate these crucial factors, showing at least a doubling of efficiency in conservation investments. There are cost-effective opportunities for conservation actions in Australia and around the world: this research will assist Governments, Non-Government Organisations, and other conservation-minded people in finding them. Further investment is required in obtaining and wisely applying socio-economic data for conservation planning and in evaluating conservation projects to improve our knowledge base.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systematic conservation planning</field><field name="subject">priority setting</field><field name="subject">Decision Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203823</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic Models for the Analysis of Quantitative Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="creator">Denis Bauer</field><field name="description">Understanding transcriptional regulation quantitatively is a crucial step towards uncovering and ultimately utilizing the regulatory semantics encoded in the genome. Transcription of a gene is induced by the binding of site-specific transcription factors (TFs) to so-called cis-regulatory-modules (CRMs). The frequency and duration of the binding events are influenced by the concentrations of the TFs, the binding affinities and location of the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the CRM as well as the properties of the TFs themselves (e.g. effectiveness, competitive interaction with other TFs). Modeling these interactions using a mathematical approach, based on sound biochemical and thermodynamic foundations, enables the understanding and quantitative prediction of transcriptional output of a target gene. In the thesis I introduce the developed framework for modeling, visualizing, and predicting the regulation of the transcription rate of a target gene. Given the concentrations of a set of TFs, the TFBSs in a regulatory DNA region, and the transcription rate of the target gene, the method will optimize its parameters to generate a predictive model that incorporates the regulatory mechanism of the observed gene. I demonstrate the generalization ability of the model by subjecting it to standard machine learning and hypothesis testing procedures. Furthermore, I demonstrate the potential of the approach by training the method on a gene in D. melanogaster and predicting the output of the homologous genes in 12 other Drosophila species where the regulatory sequence has evolved substantially but the regulatory mechanism was conserved. Finally, I investigate the proposed role-switching behaviour of TFs regulating the development of D. melanogaster, which suggests that SUMOylation is the biological mechanism facilitating the switch.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="subject">Gene Regulation</field><field name="subject">Transcription Factor</field><field name="subject">Thermodynamic modeling</field><field name="subject">Optimization Problems</field><field name="subject">Comparative Genomics</field><field name="subject">Evolution and phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">SUMOylation</field><field name="subject">D. melanogaster</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203909</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Movement skills proficiency and physical activity in 6 to 12 year old children: A case for Engaging and Coaching for Health (EACH)-Child</field><field name="creator">Ziviani, J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">C1</field><field name="subject">110321 Rehabilitation and Therapy (excl.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games.

These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of wzz genes in Salmonella typhimurium virulence.</field><field name="creator">Murray, Gerald Laurence</field><field name="description">Title page, abstract and table of contents only.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReFashion reDunn : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Janet</field><field name="description">This study arises out of the researcher&#8217;s experience in the fields of costume and fashion. It develops, through design practice and reflection, a design process for fashion wear made from post-consumer recycled materials. Theoretical analysis provides global, historical, philosophical and design contexts within which to develop an ethos for this variant form of fashion wear designated ReFashion. Differences in design process between conventional fashion and ReFashion are detailed to highlight the significance of provenance of materials in the light of a perceived need to slow down clothing production and consumption. This perception is informed by scientific predictions that failure to engage with urgently needed changes to the prevalent economic paradigm will result in planet earth reaching a tipping point with potentially disastrous results for its inhabitants. Fundamental to the ReFashion ethos is preparedness for a speculative post-apocalyptic future that might render the fashion system unable to operate as it currently does, necessitating a more self-sufficient approach to clothing needs, with an accompanying shift in perceptions of what is deemed fashionable. The theme Survivalist Fantasy provides a lens to bring conceptual and material aspects of the work into focus. Informed by sustainability, Survivalist Fantasy recontextualises a failure of sustainable initiatives on a global scale and their adaptation on a local scale specifically in the arena of clothing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">costume</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">recycled materials</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/711</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">0027: the EU : an international agent in Palestine? : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Master of Arts in Politics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lyons, Katherine</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ability of the European Union (EU) to impact on the Palestinian people and their institutions. Before using the formal concept of actorness to examine the extent of this impact, it presents a model of actorness that synthesises aspects of Bretherton and Vogler&#8217;s and Sj&#246;sjedt&#8217;s models. It uses the components of this model as a series of lenses through which to focus on and examine various facets of the EU&#8217;s influence. The analysis deals with diplomacy, aid, and the effects of the unexpected Hamas victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) elections. The thesis finds that the EU&#8217;s early lack of diplomatic direction improved for a period but was limited by its consistent inability to have an effect if it ignored the US. In the field of aid, the EU has been a more successful actor. However, the EU&#8217;s best efforts in these spheres have been undone by two EU blunders. First, it classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation and subsequently felt unable to provide aid to a Hamas-run government. Second it joined the Quartet in the hope of increasing its own diplomatic clout, but found that it had given the US the opportunity to erode its ability to act as an independent financial agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">European Union</field><field name="subject">EU actorness</field><field name="subject">Hamas</field><field name="subject">Palestinian politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360105 International relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1156</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drawing from experience : visual modality in historic narrative illustration : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Institute of Communication Design, College of Creative Arts, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hunkin, Mathew</field><field name="description">This research investigates critical methods for approaching aesthetic design decisions in illustration.  As a method of communication illustration qualifies its subjects through aesthetic choices, or modalities.  The qualifying nature of these modalities can affect communication in an image and this research seeks an explicit understanding of how this communication occurs. This practice-based research project employs two aesthetic extremes, line and tone, in the creation of four historic visual  narratives designed to fill visual gaps in the history of 1 Commando Fiji Guerillas.  Line and tone are tendered as a means of visually negotiating the informing records of the Fiji Commando experience, records characterised by both conflict and absence.  Can these disparate, conflicting, yet necessary records of experience be visually acknowledged in an illustrated expansion of the Fiji Commando's visual history? This position serves as the point of departure for research. An understanding of the communicative properties of line and tone is followed by investigation into their relationship to the propositions they represent, with initial research suggesting that modalities reflect the social contexts from which they encode.  This relationship implied a means to negotiate the historic records necessary in a contemporary visual articulation of the Fiji Commando experience through the strategic use of aesthetic modalities to acknowledge the nature of informing source material. This practice-based approach to research allowed the consolidation of both the possible and the probable in the creation of a new visual, historic text, while revealing analytical approaches to aesthetic choice.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual narrative</field><field name="subject">Visual communication</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410299 Visual arts and crafts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1342</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rotten with perfection? : an exploration of the rhetoric of knowledge in knowledge management : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Teo-Dixon, Grace Poh Lyn</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Teo-Dixon, G. &amp; Monin, N.

The tool is intended to create an informative hub that influences a travellers experience of a location. Ethnographic research as reflective sketching was conducted in the Tongariro National Park. Within this setting reflective sketching located the kitchen and common area of traveller specific accommodation as an ideal collaborative environment to conduct participatory design research. In this collaborative environment snowboarders and skiers who are aged between 20-30 years are identified as the target audience. This specific audience participated in co-creative sessions throughout the design process, resulting in the participatory design of the tool. The design aim of the visual communication tool was to promote the exchange of experience between snowboarders and skiers about a specific location. This was achieved by adapting generative tools made up of a visual language which supported the word of mouth exchange and individual expression. The exchange of experiences was facilitated by co-creative sketching with the visual language during a state of play. Playful co-creative sketching supported word of mouth dialogue between the snowboarders and skiers in a way that co-created an informative visual representation of the dialogue or contextmap. The resulting contextmap represented an image for experience which was beyond an individuals conception and made individuals tacit-knowledge accessible to audiences within and outside the moment of exchange, creating an informative hub which influenced the specific audiences view of experience for a location. An action research methodology is used during the course of this research, informed by the approaches of co-creation, context-mapping and generative tools. These approaches constructed a theoretical framework for the participatory development and co-creative sketching of the communication tool. This supportive thesis discusses the context, the theoretical concepts and provides an in depth account on the research through design process; the week-by-week participatory process undertaken to develop the visual communication tool.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication design</field><field name="subject">Co-creation</field><field name="subject">Visual communication</field><field name="subject">Snowboarding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1340</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metadata_photography and the construction of meaning : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree Master of Fine Arts to Massey University, College of Creative Arts, School of Fine Arts, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nishioka, Mizuho</field><field name="description">Photographic technology is increasingly respondent to a desire for the production and consumption of information.

However, the implementation of evidence into clinical practice is a highly complex endeavour that has been said to occur in a 'black box&#8216;, defying easily reached explanations of how it happens in practice. The aim of this study is to explore the 'black box&#8216; of guideline implementation associated with primary health care nurses&#8216; use of a guideline that targets high health need populations in a region of New Zealand. The potential for improvement of cardiovascular health overall and the reduction of the marked disparities between M&#228;ori (indigenous people of New Zealand) and non-M&#228;ori drives the imperative to enact the recommendations of the Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. Primary health care nurses are well positioned at the frontline of healthcare to implement the guideline and an investigation of the realities of their practice as they do so will help to illuminate the contents of this particular 'black box&#8216;. The aim is achieved in two components by: 1. Exploring the complexities of primary health care nurses&#8216; use of the New Zealand Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. 2. Employing the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework to identify the enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in the primary health care setting. Method Both components of this study involve qualitative methods. The first component involves qualitative description utilising focus groups and interviews to explore the perceptions and experiences of a range of primary health care professionals involved in implementing the AMCVR guideline and thematic analysis of data. The second component utilises template analysis of the data, based on the Promoting Action of Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework. There are three elements of the PARiHS framework: Evidence, Context and Facilitation. This second component of the study is a systematic analysis of the enablers and barriers encountered by nurses as they implement the AMCVR guideline. Results The first component of the study generated four themes, which together have provided a rich portrait of the realities for nurses as they implemented the guideline. The four themes are self-managing client, everyday nursing practice, developing new relationships in the health team, and impact on health care delivery. The template analysis revealed that there were several enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in relation to Evidence and Context and that Facilitation was not occurring in a planned way. Conclusion Successful guideline implementation demands multidisciplinary, transformational practice development to create an effective workplace culture. Practice development is a powerful approach well suited to supporting primary health care nurses to maximise their practice-based knowledge and skills, and for them to contribute to the development of systems that will meet the information and communication requirements of successful guideline implementation. The imperative to improve cardiovascular health overall and specifically to address M&#228;ori health inequity mandates sustained effort and mobilisation of resources to ensure successful implementation of the AMCVR guideline.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative description.</field><field name="subject">Clinical practice guidelines.</field><field name="subject">Primary health care.</field><field name="subject">Implementation of evidence.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1074</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgements during information seeking : policy and research workers' assessments of enough information.</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Jennifer M.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how people determine they have enough information, a fundamental but perplexing question for human information behaviour researchers. Informed by theories of human judgement and decision making, the thesis investigates the ways in which judgements of enough information are made and the subtleties that shape this critical judgement. The empirical work that underpinned the thesis was an exploratory study conducted from an interpretive orientation and using the case study approach. The study examined multiple cases of judgements of enough information made while seeking and using information in the workplace. Semi-structured interviews (33) were conducted with public sector policy and research workers in Australia. Two interviews were carried out, the first with individual participants to explore the nature of the contexts in which they worked and the second, a paired interview with two participants to focus on how they assessed they had enough information. Interviews were taped and transcribed and inductive data analysis carried out. Principal findings included the importance of task in shaping judgements of enough information through an iterative and fluid process. Throughout the process the nature of what constituted enough information changed. Factors in the information use environment of the policy and research workers that shaped their judgements of enough information included the views of colleagues, supervisors and stakeholders, organisational decision making processes and organisational attitudes towards uncertainty. The collaborative information seeking and use of the policy and research workers resulted in collaborative judgements of enough information. The research makes three contributions to the field of human information behaviour research. Firstly findings provide new insights into judgements of enough information made by the policy and research workers, illuminating the judgement of enough information as a process and refining concepts critical to understanding judgements made while seeking and using information. Secondly the study provides a rich description of policy and research workers, a professional group not previously studied in relation to enough information, and their role in the public policy process. Thirdly concern about the limitations of behavioural decision theory to fully explain judgements of enough information led to consideration of naturalistic decision making, a recent development in decision theory. Naturalistic decision making affords a different perspective on human judgement and decision making. As a conceptual framework within which to develop more nuanced understandings of judgements and decision making during information seeking, naturalistic decision making has much to offer human information behaviour researchers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1076</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the structural behaviour of the fold-away shelter.</field><field name="creator">Rondero, Thomas Rolan E.</field><field name="description">The F-shelter underwent non-destructive monotonic load tests and destructive shake table test. The timber-framed shear walls with different sheatings; namely wood wool cement boards (wwcb) and F11 structural plywood were tested under uniaxial loading. Furthermore, finite element models (FEM) supplemented the experimental work. An FEM of the corner metal bracket and a 2-dimensional FEM for the timber-framed shear wall were generated and verified from the experimental work.  Behavioural responses from unidirectional lateral loading of the wall were obtained. For the dynamic test, the Kobe earthquake and Zone IV earthquake were simulated to determine the dynamic response of the F-shelter. Excitation was limited to 70% full scale displacement record of Kobe and 80% of Zone IV, due to the 100mm limitation in the allowable displacement on both sides of the shaker table. The shake table test showed that the F-shelter can withstand the simulated earthquakes.  FEMs were developed using ANSYS 7.2, a general finite element software. A requisite input data for the timber-framed shear wall FEM in lieu of a hinge connection corner joint for the timber-framed shear wall were generated through experimental work on the corner metal brackets and verified with the generated FEM. The results of the FEM of the Dipterocarpus grandiflorus Blanco (Apitong) timber-framed sheathed with wwcb were 5% to 9% higher than the average values for maximum deflections and maximum load capacity. The FEM results of the Radiata pine sheathed with F11 plywood, however, were 25% to 14% lower than the average values for maximum deflections and maximum load capacity.  This thesis has demonstrated the process of generating FEMs that can be used as a tool to improve and modify the F-shelter. The structural reliability of design and construction of the first F-shelter prototype was verified from the whole house test and structural modeling of the wall using FEM.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1077</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of multiple hypothesis testing procedures in the presence of dependence</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Sandra Jane</field><field name="description">Hypothesis testing is foundational to the discipline of statistics.

K.</field><field name="description">Traditionally New Zealand ecological research has focused on nature outside of cities, however, as with global trends, there is now more interest being given to the ecological functioning of cities and the potential they may hold for protecting native biodiversity. Traditionally, efforts to maintain biodiversity in urban areas have been restricted to remnants of native vegetation and restoration activities. Little attention has been given to how native biodiversity could be woven into the urban fabric in an ecologically meaningful way. One option, that is receiving much attention overseas, is to recruit underutilised urban spaces such as wasteland. A subset of urban wasteland, abandoned industrial areas usually awaiting development and other areas such as the railway buffer, are referred to here as greyfield. These are ephemeral sites that may sit between uses for as little as a few months to many years. Overseas, particularly in European countries, these have been recognised as important habitat for both native and introduced plant species. In New Zealand cities these support primarily introduced plants and their contribution to native biodiversity has been unknown. This thesis took an interdisciplinary approach to the question of whether urban greyfields might have potential value as biodiversity protection and conservation opportunity. Ecological methods were combined with an assessment of the planning framework to answer this question. iii Greyfields in Christchurch, New Zealand were surveyed to determine their current contribution to native biodiversity and whether they may act as urban analogues of natural habitats. Overseas research has shown that urban features such as pavements, walls and rooftops offer habitats analogous to cliffs and rocky habitats. Cities are therefore increasing the habitat exploitable by species whose natural habitats are geographically restricted. The Christchurch greyfields were assessed for their potential to act as analogues of four habitat types that have been categorised as historically rare in New Zealand: braided riverbeds, shingle beaches, rock outcrops and limestone outcrops. The findings suggest that urban greyfields, if managed appropriately, have the potential to support a wider range of native species Planning documents and biodiversity strategies written for Christchurch were assessed to see how well they facilitated non-traditional biodiversity enhancement initiatives, specifically the greyfield network for native biodiversity. A major finding here was a lack of information on how to enhance biodiversity where little of the natural features of the landscape were left and that this was creating a barrier to adopting more integrative approaches to enhancing native biodiversity. Finally, a plan to create a greyfield network for native biodiversity is proposed and suggestions are made as to minor changes to the planning framework that would more easily facilitate the uptake of novel biodiversity enhancement initiatives in the City.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wasteland</field><field name="subject">greyfield</field><field name="subject">biodiversity</field><field name="subject">enhancement</field><field name="subject">braided riverbed</field><field name="subject">habitat template</field><field name="subject">historically rare ecosystems</field><field name="subject">limestone</field><field name="subject">novel ecosystems</field><field name="subject">reconciliation ecology</field><field name="subject">rock outcrop</field><field name="subject">shingle beach</field><field name="subject">urban analogues</field><field name="subject">urban ecology</field><field name="subject">urban cliff hypothesis</field><field name="subject">wasteland</field><field name="subject">12 - Built Environment and Design</field><field name="subject">05 - Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1924</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Psychophysiology of positive and negative affect</field><field name="creator">Wilde, Kerrie</field><field name="description">Based on Fowles' 1980 explanation for the fractionation of the autonomic cardiac and electrodermal measures, this thesis explores the patterns of heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL) activity accompanying positive and negative emotion. A second aim of this thesis is to explore the psychophysiological changes experienced during challenging adventure activities, and whether these changes reflect changes in state anxiety and self esteem.A preliminary study carried out on the Ropes Course, an Outdoor Education adventure activity, indicated that participants experienced strong emotional and physiological changes during this activity. Dissociation of HR and blood pressure measures was found in this Study, with only systolic blood pressure reflecting group changes in state anxiety. In the main field studies, children aged 10-12 years participating on a Ropes Course activity were monitored "in situ" for HR and SCL changes using an ambulatory monitor with laboratory levels of precision. Fractionation of the HR and SCL measures was confirmed in the second study, with different HR and SCL response patterns found across the Ropes Course element epochs. In contrast to predictions based on Fowles' (1980) hypothesis, analyses of the physiological and emotion data in Study 3 found that the average HR and SCL levels recorded on the six elements of the Ropes Course differentially reflected levels of negative and positive emotion (respectively). These findings were confirmed in Study 5 after consideration of motility (movement) effects on the HR and SCL measures. Further studies using the Ropes Course activity indicated that increases in self esteem were associated with either higher SCL or lower HR levels during some of the more challenging elements of the Ropes Course. These data imply a relationship between self esteem and the experience of emotion during the successful completion of challenging adventure activities.In the laboratory, adult students participated in 10 one minute imagery sessions that were used to evoke positive and negative emotions of various intensity. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark and Tellegen, 1988) confirmed that students experienced emotions that were significantly different from a baseline state. The NA and PA scores were used to plot each imagery session on the experimental "affective space". Analyses of the physiological data in both laboratory studies supported the association of HR with negative emotion. The SCL measure was found to be not as responsive under imagery conditions, although greater sensitivity in this measure was found for positive emotion. In the second laboratory study, the PA and NA scores were also used to calculate an arousal, valence and emotion intensity score for each imagery session. Exploratory regression analyses indicated that HR reflected both emotion intensity and arousal emotion characteristics.The field and laboratory studies described in this thesis support linkages of HR with negative emotion and SCL with positive emotion contradicting Fowles' hypothesis. Together, these studies present a unique and more theoretical approach to the study of emotion. In addition, the field studies illustrate the benefits of psychophysiological research in Outdoor Education and the value of "in situ" monitoring.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1674</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions</field><field name="creator">Russell, Benjamin Gallard, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Odour plays an important role in many predator/prey interactions. In the northern hemisphere, many mammalian prey species have been shown to respond to predator odours. It is also widely assumed that mammalian predators utilise odours to locate their prey. This thesis explores the importance of odour in Australian mammalian predator/prey interactions. Responses of native Australian species to the faecal odour of two predators; the native tiger quoll Dasyurus maculatus and the introduced red fox Vulpes vulpes, were evaluated through live-trapping and focussed behavioural studies of captive animals. Tiger quoll responses to prey olfactory cues were investigated in a captive experiment. Native rodents (bush rats Rattus fuscipes, swamp rats R. lutreolus and eastern chestnut mice Pseudomys gracilicaudatus) equally avoided traps scented with either quoll or fox faeces, and in captive experiments, bush rats and swamp rats reduced their average speed in response to both predator odours. Of the marsupial species, northern brown bandicoots Isoodon macrourus and common brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula were captured more frequently in quoll-scented traps than unscented traps or foxscented traps, while captures of brown antechinus Antechinus stuarttii, long-nosed bandicoots Perameles nasuta and southern brown bandicoot I. obesulus were unaffected by the either predator odour. In captive experiments, brown antechinus, long-nosed and northern brown bandicoots decreased their foraging in response to both predator odours, and spent less time in areas scented with quoll faeces. Tiger quolls didn't appear to detect odour sources from a distance of &gt;65 cm, but they did follow scent trails and spent more time in areas scented with the urine and faeces of potential prey. Chemical analysis revealed no common components in fox and quoll odour which prey species could be responding to. Therefore, these native species have evolved to respond to fox odour since foxes were introduced to Australia 130 years ago. The stronger response of native rodents to fox odour may be a legacy of their co-evolution with canid predators prior to entering Australia. A better understanding of how odour is utilised in Australian predator/prey interactions may lead to a greater ability to protect Australia's unique mammalian fauna from introduced predators.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predation (Biology)</field><field name="subject">Predatory animals - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Spotted-tailed quoll - Ecology - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Red fox - Ecology - Australia - Sense organs</field><field name="subject">Rodents - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Brown antechinus - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Bandicoots - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula - Effects of predation on - Australia</field><field name="subject">Smell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25144</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifetime monitoring of appliances for reuse</field><field name="creator">Mazhar, Muhammad Ilyas, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Environmental awareness and legislative pressures have made manufacturers responsible for the take-back and end-of-life treatment of their products. Therefore, manufacturers are struggling to find ways to recover maximum value from returned products. This goal can best be achieved by promoting multiple reuse programs as reuse is one of the most effective ways to enhance a sustainable engineering economy. Since the essential goal of the reuse strategy is to reuse parts, the reliability of used parts becomes a core issue. Research indicates that reuse is technologically feasible, associated with a significant manufacturing cost saving, and it does not compromise product quality. However, it is not easy to be applied in reality. There are several uncertainties associated with reuse, the most common is the uncertainty of the product???s quality after use. A widespread implementation of the reuse strategy could be triggered, subject to the availability of reliable methods to assess the useful remaining life of parts. The evolution of such a methodology would play a pivotal role in making decisions on the supply chain process and the recovery value of returned products. Reliability assessment by life cycle data analysis is the basis of this research. The proposed methodology addresses the problem of reliability assessment of used parts by considering two important aspects. It performs statistical as well as condition monitoring data analysis for decision-making on reuse. The analysis is carried out in two stages. Firstly, a wellknown reliability assessment procedure, the Weibull analysis, is applied to analyse time-tofailure data to assess the overall reuse potential of components. In the second stage, the used capacity (actual life) of components is determined by analysing their operating history (condition monitoring data). The linear and nonlinear regression analysis, Kriging procedures and artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed in this stage. Finally, the Weibull analysis and ANNs are integrated to estimate the remaining useful life of components/assemblies of a product at the end of its first life cycle. The model was validated by using life cycle data from consumer products.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Recycled products</field><field name="subject">Production engineering - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Industrial management - Environmental aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25963</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental and theoretical investigation for the machining of hardened alloy steels</field><field name="creator">Lee, Tae-Hong, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research work in this thesis involves an experimental and theoretical investigation for high speed machining of AISI 4140 medium carbon steels and AISI D2 tool steels which are classified as being difficult to machine materials. An experimental program was carried out to determine the cutting forces, chip formation, the secondary deformation zone thickness and surface roughness at different cutting speeds using a 0.4mm and 0.8mm nose radii ceramic tools and -7?? rake angle for annealed (virgin) AISI 4140 and heat treated AISI 4140 steel. Another series of experiments was carried out on the annealed (virgin) and heat treated AISI D2 with 0.4mm, 0.8mm and 1.2mm nose radii CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) tools under various cutting conditions.  A theoretical model is developed by taking into account the flow stress properties of the AISI 4140 (0.44% carbon content) to use with the Oxley Machining approach. To find the flow stress data for AISI D2 tool steel, the Johnson and Cook empirical constitutive equation is used as the constitutive model. In addition, the magnitude of tool radius should be also considered to determine the prediction of cutting performances. To account for the effect of nose radius edge in hard machining, a simplified geometrical method is used to model the parameters for application in the Oxley Model and works for the cutting conditions considered here. These extensions to the Oxley machining theory were verified by experimental results. These results show a good agreement between the Oxley machining theory and hard machining experiment at data. The research work described in this thesis provides useful data for hard machining conditions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Metallurgy.</field><field name="subject">Steel alloys -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40624</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-verbal and verbal behaviour of beginner learners of Japanese: pragmatic failure and native speaker evaluation</field><field name="creator">Fukuda-Oddie, Mayumi, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study, undertaken within the field of interlanguage pragmatics, investigates the kinds of pragmatic failures observed among tertiary level foreign learners of Japanese and also seeks to find reasons to help explain the occurrence of these failures. The focus of the study is on the data generated from a role play where a student has to borrow a book from their Japanese teacher. The primary role play is performed by nine beginner level learners of Japanese studying at an Australian university, but the role play is also performed by ten Japanese native speakers in order to determine what is normative for native speakers in this situation. Unlike previous studies in this area, this research collects kinesic non-verbal data in addition to linguistic data. The data is analysed using Thomas's (1983) concept of pragmatic failure, and Brown and Levinson's (1978, 1987) politeness theory. The study also considers whether Japanese native speakers evenly evaluate the role play performances of the Japanese learners. Despite difficulties in the application of these linguistic theories to beginner level learners, a number of sociopragmatic failures and one pragmalinguistic failure are observed in the role play performances of the Japanese learners. These are partially explained by a lack of instruction, nervousness in performing the role play and the learners' limited proficiency in the Japanese language. Inconsistencies are also observed in the way that JNS participants evaluate the role play performances of the JFL learners.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language.</field><field name="subject">Interlanguage (Language learning)</field><field name="subject">Pragmatics.</field><field name="subject">Failure (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Students -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scratch-pad memory management for static data aggregates</field><field name="creator">Li, Lian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scratch-pad memory (SPM), a fast on-chip SRAM managed by software, is widely used in embedded systems. Compared to hardware-managed cache, SPM can be more efficient in performance, power and area cost, and has the added advantage of better time predictability. In this thesis, SPMs should be seen in a general context. For example, in stream processors, a software-managed stream register file is usually used to stage data to and from off-chip memory. In IBM's Cell architecture, each co-processor has a software-managed local store for keeping data and instructions.  SPM management is critical for SPM-based embedded systems. In this thesis, we propose two novel methodologies, the memory colouring methodology and the perfect colouring methodology, to place the static data aggregates such as arrays and structs of a program in SPM. Our methodologies are dynamic in the sense that some data aggregates can be swapped into and out of SPM during program execution. To this end, a live range splitting heuristic is introduced in order to create potential data transfer statements between SPM and off-chip memory.  The memory colouring methodology is a general-purpose compiler approach. The novelty of this approach lies in partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file then generalising existing graph colouring algorithms for register allocation to colour data aggregates. In this thesis, a scheme for partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file is introduced. This methodology is inter-procedural and therefore operates on the interference graph for the data aggregates in the whole program. Different graph colouring algorithms may give rise to different results due to live range splitting and spilling heuristics used. As a result, two representative graph colouring algorithms, George and Appel's iterative-coalescing and Park and Moon's optimistic-coalescing, are generalised and evaluated for SPM allocation.  Like memory colouring, perfect colouring is also inter-procedural. The novelty of this second methodology lies in formulating the SPM allocation problem as an interval colouring problem. The interval colouring problem is an NP problem and no widely-accepted approximation algorithms exist. The key observation is that the interference graphs for data aggregates in many embedded applications form a special class of superperfect graphs. This has led to the development of two additional SPM allocation algorithms. While differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together, both algorithms place data aggregates in SPM based on the cliques in an interference graph. In both cases, we guarantee optimally that all data aggregates in an interference graph can be placed in SPM if the given SPM size is no smaller than the chromatic number of the graph.  We have developed two memory colouring algorithms and two perfect colouring algorithms for SPM allocation. We have evaluated them using a set of embedded applications. Our results show that both methodologies are efficient and effective in handling large-scale embedded applications. While neither methodology outperforms the other consistently, perfect colouring has yielded better overall results in the set of benchmarks used in our experiments. All these algorithms are expected to be valuable. For example, they can be made available as part of the same compiler framework to assist the embedded designer with exploring a large number of optimisation opportunities for a particular embedded application.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scratch-pad memory.</field><field name="subject">Compiler.</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monumental amnesia: reading the spatial narratives written by contemporary urban landscapes.</field><field name="creator">Rozentals, Darien Jane, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Monumental Amnesia: Reading the Spatial Narratives Written by Contemporary Urban Landscapes This thesis analyses the spatial stories inscribed into urban landscapes by monuments. Differentiating between officially sanctioned, symbolic, and everyday monuments, this thesis theorises the narratological space composed by these objects: static, imagined and transitional, respectively. It argues that monumental sites are spaces of forgetting, rather than remembering, characterised through invisibility, opacity and mystification. Infused with paradox, monuments simultaneously reveal and conceal the histories and urban memories they are expected to commemorate. The discussion then turns to contemporary art, in particular memory installations, as a practice that counters the mystification inherent within urban space, actively exposing alternative pasts and memories. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first analyses the contemporary, officially sanctioned monuments of Vilnius, Lithuania that celebrate an ancient nationalism, alongside two neighboring sculpture parks that display retired Soviet icons, with a particular focus on Gintaris Karosas?? sculpture Infotree LNK. The second chapter theorises symbolic monuments, and focuses on the Japanese theme park Tobu World Square as a curiosity cabinet where the contemporary spatial practice, identified by Anthony Giddens, of ??disembedding?? is performed in miniature. It concludes with a discussion of Susan Norrie??s DVD installation of the park ENOLA. The third chapter examines everyday monuments, focusing on the industrial ruins of Manchester to unravel the archival aspects of these monuments and their gentrification. It closes with a study of Cornelia Parker??s installation Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View. Through these urban case studies and accompanying memory installations, the thesis explores how urban monuments disguise certain histories and memories of a city, and how art can reclaim alternative stories and memories from urban amnesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41245</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating factors that influence carbon dissolution from Coke into Molten iron.</field><field name="creator">Cham, S. Tsuey, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality.  As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted.  The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450-1550 ??C. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ??C for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s-1) = 0.47 to K (x 103 s-1) = 14.7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates.  The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role.  Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ??C was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123-129?? in the initial stages and between 109-114?? after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution.  The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke.  Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates.  The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles.  There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid iron.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Carbon.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40685</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of bone defect models in immunodeficient animals</field><field name="creator">Gan, Jade Ho Yue, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bone defects resulting from non-unions, fractures, significant revision joint replacements, tumour resection and osteolysis present a clinical problem. While autografts are considered the gold standard, ubiquitous use of this reparative technique is limited by graft supply and site morbidity. Recent progresses in tissue engineering using stem cells, bone enhancing molecules and gene therapy have provided more hypotheses for bone defect treatment. In vivo assessment to test these hypotheses requires animal models to mimic human conditions. Immunodeficient or nude animals have the advantage of hosting materials from human and other xenographic origins without immuno-intolerance or rejection. A thorough understanding of the biology in nude animals is vital for the further advancement of connective tissue healing and regeneration strategies. Nude mice are excellent xenographic hosts for in- vivo characterisation and provide a reproducible animal source. The immune deficiencies of nude compared to normal animals may however, influence bone healing and need to be addressed. This dissertation (a) investigated potential bone defect models in nude mice and nude rats (b) incorporated the selected bone defect model to evaluate the effect of T cell deficiency and age on bone defect healing in nude animals (c) determined the feasibility of a critical size defect (CSD) in nude mice. A distal-femur-condylar-defect (DFCD) model was successfully performed in nude mice and rats. The model was found to have some advantages as a bone defect model: (1) located at a weight-bearing skeletal site (2) no requirements for an internal or external fixator (3) does not obstruct or limit mobility (4) location is not in close proximity to any major organs such as the brain (5) easy identification of surface anatomy (6) defect size is standardised and reproducible (7) does not require lengthy and complicated surgery and (8) cost effective. This dissertation confirmed that bone healing in nude mice is similar to that of normal immunocompetent mice. Absence of T lymphocytes did not delay or inhibit bone repair. Use of older nude mice did not seem to affect the healing rate, in contrast to older normal mice, which showed delay in bone healing in the initial phase. Establishment of critical sized defects in mice at a weight-bearing location was not feasible due to the robust healing of murine. This dissertation recommends that the DFCD model could be utilized for the assessment of xenogenic materials at early time point.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone-grafting</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22429</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking visual preferences and visual sensitivity to image structure</field><field name="creator">Wong, Solomon Kim-Nung, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The statistical structure of natural images has sparked interest in regards to both visual processing of such images and the aesthetic responses they elicit. We bring together these two lines of research under the simple proposition that early visual processing, more specifically visual sensitivity, may mediate visual preferences. In our first set of experiments, we measured both visual preference and visual sensitivity in the same observers, using patterns varying in the slope of their amplitude spectrum. Our results found similar functions for both variables, supporting our hypothesis. In a second set of experiments, we investigated the same question with regards to simple spatial frequency variations, and found even more convincing results.

This thesis extends GE as follows: GE as an extension of Genetic Programming (GP) A novel method of automatically extracting information from the grammar is introduced. This additional information allows the use of GP style crossover which in turn allows GE to perform identically to a strongly typed GP system as well as a non-typed (or canonical) GP system. Two test problems are presented one which is more easily solved by the GP style crossover and one which favours the tradition GE ???Ripple Crossover???. With this new crossover operator GE can now emulate GP (as well as retaining its own unique features) and can therefore now be seen as an extension of GP. Dynamically Defined Functions An extension to the BNF grammar is presented which allows the use of dynamically defined functions (DDFs). DDFs provide an alternative to the traditional approach of Automatically Defined Functions (ADFs) but have the advantage that the number of functions and their parameters do not need to be specified by the user in advance. In addition DDFs allow the architecture of individuals to change dynamically throughout the course of the run without requiring the introduction of any new form of operator. Experimental results are presented confirming the effectiveness of DDFs. Self-Selecting (or variable) crossover. A self-selecting operator is introduced which allows the system to determine, during the course of the run, which crossover operator to apply; this is tested over several problem domains and (especially where small populations are used) is shown to be effective in aiding the system to overcome local optima.

The majority of the cyanide is consumed by minerals contained in the gold ore to produce many different cyanide soluble complexes or used in converting cyanide to other related species such as thiocyanate and cyanate. The high costs associated with cyanide and thiocyanate detoxification and excessive cyanide utilisation encountered when treating ores with high cyanide consumption constitutes a significant proportion of the overall processing costs. This study examines the possibility of recovering free cyanide from thiocyanate using a process based on the Acidification-Volatilisation-Regeneration (AVR) circuit in conjunction with a pre-concentration stage using commercially available ionexchange resin. From thermodynamic modelling based on the STABCAL program it was found that it was thermodynamically possible to recover cyanide from thiocyanate if the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate can be stopped. Addition of copper to the system found that the majority of the thiocyanate exists as copper(I) thiocyanate (CuSCN) solid. Using ion-exchange resins can be an effective way to concentrate thiocyanate from tailing solutions or slurries. Four different models were successfully used to model the equilibria between thiocyanate and chloride on commercial ion-exchange resins. By normalising the equilibria data when applying the Mass action law the equilibria becomes independent of ionic strength within the range of concentration considered. An advantage of this is that only one unique equilibrium constant is used to describe the ion-exchange process. The electrochemical and kinetic studies showed that the reaction between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide is catalysed by hydrogen ions. Secondly under acidic conditions the rate of cyanide recovery by the AVR circuit was faster than at higher pH conditions. The overall reaction of thiocyanate with respect to the concentration of thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide is an overall third order reaction. The derived third order rate expression is first order with respect to thiocyanate concentration and second order with respect to hydrogen peroxide concentration. Previous studies showed that the production of cyanide inhibits the reactions between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide, but by removing cyanide from the reaction by air stripping, this was not observed. Addition of copper to the system did not show a catalytic effect on the reaction but it was found that copper (II) ions suppresses competing reactions that occurred without affecting the reaction between thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23018</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins of the banlieue rouge: politics, local government and communal identity in Arcueil and Cachan, 1919-1958.</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Jasen Lewis, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">By elucidating the origins of the banlieue rouge, a belt of communist-dominated suburbs surrounding Paris that arose during the interwar years and reached its apogee under the Fourth Republic, this thesis addresses the problem of why twentieth-century France was home to a pro-Soviet communist party with mass support. Specifically, a local study of the PCF in Arcueil and Cachan, two neighbouring communes south of Paris with divergent political evolutions since World War I, is used to discern how and why the Parti communiste fran??ais (PCF) came to exert hegemony in the working-class suburbs of Paris. After surveying the historiography of communism in France and beyond, this thesis concludes that the communist banlieue rouge was born of working-class alienation from bourgeois society that was nourished by a communist counter-society that was contingent upon the PCF???s capacity to adapt and respond to local circumstances. Using archival sources and statistical analysis, it demonstrates that in Arcueil and Cachan rapid suburbanisation and an attendant proletarianisation created the pre-conditions for the rise of the PCF. This study finds that during the interwar period the PCF rapidly emerged as an electoral force in both suburbs as it set about laying the foundations of a communist counter-society, especially in Arcueil where it won control of local government in 1935. In Arcueil, the PCF spearheaded the local Resistance movement during World War II and then under the Fourth Republic went on to consolidate a nascent communist communal identity, while in Cachan its influence fell victim to Cold War politics. The pre-conditions for the rise of communism were apparent earlier and to a greater degree in Arcueil, an industrialised, working-class suburb with long-standing radical traditions, than in the traditionally conservative Cachan. In Arcueil, the PCF was more successful than its counterpart in Cachan at exploiting an alienation that was not only part of the deep-seated historical traditions of the French working class but was also part of everyday life f or workers forced to live in miserable conditions. In suburbs such as Arcueil, suburban working-class pride at being a social outcast was conflated with communism to create a durable communist communal identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">All the Small Things: The Refinement of Foraminiferal Analysis to Determine Site Formation Processes in Archaeological Sediments</field><field name="creator">Rosendahl, Daniel</field><field name="description">Foraminifera are single cell protozoa that are ubiquitous in marine environments. The hard casings, or tests, of foraminifera are routinely studied in the earth sciences, particularly for palaeoenvironmental information. Foraminifera have been little studied by archaeologists, however, despite their potential to contribute to understandings of coastal site formation processes and localised palaeoenvironments. In this study techniques and methods of foraminiferal analysis are developed and applied to the problem of distinguishing between natural and cultural marine shell deposits, using the Mort Creek Site Complex, central Queensland, as a case study. Results allow unambiguous demarcation of the natural and cultural deposits studied based on patterns of foraminiferal density. Natural deposits were found to have more than 1000 foraminifera per 100g of sediment, while cultural deposits exhibited less than 50 foraminifera per 100g of sediment. The range of taxa represented in the foraminiferal assemblage is consistent with a shallow water sub-tropical marine ecosystem, indicating general environmental stability throughout the period of deposit formation.

There has been considerable debate regarding the most appropriate sieve  sizes and quantification methods that should be applied in the recovery of vertebrate faunal remains. Few studies, however, have addressed the impact of recovery and quantification methods on the  interpretation of invertebrates, specifically shellfish remains. In this study, five shellfish taxa representing four bivalves (Anadara trapezia, Trichomya hirsutus, Saccostrea glomerata, Donax  deltoides) and one gastropod (Pyrazus ebeninus) common in eastern Australian midden assemblages are sieved through 10mm, 6.3mm and 3.15mm mesh. Results are quantified using MNI, NISP and weight.  Analyses indicate that different structural properties and pre- and postdepositional factors affect recovery rates. Fragile taxa (T. hirsutus) or those with foliated structure (S. glomerata) tend  to be overrepresented by NISP measures in smaller sieve fractions, while more robust taxa (A. trapezia and P. ebeninus) tend to be overrepresented by weight measures. Results demonstrate that for  all quantification methods tested a 3mm sieve should be used on all sites to allow for regional comparability and to effectively collect all available information about the shellfish  remains.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">southeast Queensland</field><field name="subject">recovery techniques</field><field name="subject">shell middens</field><field name="subject">shellfish</field><field name="subject">Seven Mile Creek Mound</field><field name="subject">Sandstone Point</field><field name="subject">One-Tree</field><field name="subject">taphonomy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:12664</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential for a novel alcoholic drink prepared from the New Zealand native plant Cordyline australis (ti k&#333;uka)</field><field name="creator">Patel, Minaxi</field><field name="description">Some New Zealand indigenous plants may offer unique qualities that can be used to secure an exclusive niche in the alcoholic drinks market in the same way that Scotch whisky and tequila are strongly identified with the country of origin, Scotland and Mexico. Tequila is a spirit distilled from a fermented agave, dry adapted lily. Agave is in the family Agavaceae, a notable New Zealand member of which is the common cabbage tree or ti k&#333;uka (Cordyline australis). Similarly, to the agave having a fermentable core, ti k&#333;uka has carbohydrate (inulin) content in its young stems and roots that can be hydrolysed in acidic suspensions or by enzyme hydrolysis to yield fructose. The main objective of this thesis was to systematically research the feasibility of the production of a tequila-like spirit from ti k&#333;uka stem, profiling the chemical properties of the spirit with a view of future commercial production of an iconic New Zealand spirit. The initial stage of the thesis focused on extracting inulin from the ti k&#333;uka stem and hydrolysing (by both acid and enzyme) it to yield reducing sugar. The sugar concentration yielded was too low (~ 10 to 15%) to be fermented and distilled economically. Rather, the ti k&#333;uka extract was evaporated to produce flavoured products by the Maillard reaction, a reaction between amino acids and sugars. The flavoured compounds were then infused with potable ethanol. In outline, the dried stem was hydrolysed with an inulinase at 60&#176;C for 1 hour. The pH was adjusted to 10 with sodium hydroxide and evaporated at 60&#176;C for 65 hours. The dried extract was reconstituted with water, centrifuged and the supernatant infused with portable ethanol to yield final different concentrations of 80, 67, 57 and 50%. The ethanol treatments simultaneously extracted flavour and colour to varying degrees. Next, sugars and amino acids were analysed in the ti k&#333;uka stems by liquid chromatography. The most abundant sugar present in the ti k&#333;uka after inulinase hydrolysis was fructose and the dominant amino acids were arginine, leucine, lysine, and aspartic acid/aspargine and glutamic acid/glutamine. Amino acids and reducing sugar were also analysed at different stages of the spirit production. The reducing sugar content decreased during each step of the process. The relative concentrations of arginine, leucine and lysine decreased while that of aspartic and glutamic acids increased during the whole process of making the spirit. Model systems were then used to simulate the reactions taking place between the amino acids and reducing sugar present in the ti k&#333;uka extract. The colour of the models became darker as a function of time, accumulating more brown pigment containing the flavoured compounds. Increasing the pH and concentration of the amino acids in the reaction mixture also increased the browning pigment formation. Dichloromethane and n-pentane and diethyl ether solvent extraction of the spirits and analysis of volatiles by gas chromatography- mass spectrometry revealed that the chemical profiles of the spirits were different from those of the commercial spirits, gin, tequila and whisky. Sensory evaluation was performed on four variations of the spirit, and demonstrated that the creations were consumer-acceptable. The costs and other issues involved in producing and marketing such a spirit were identified, the major selling point being geographical exclusivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cordyline australis</field><field name="subject">Maillard reaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/894</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Package design for children: do practitioners get it right?</field><field name="creator">Chareonsakdi, Thidarat</field><field name="description">The literature indicates that children are highly influenced by product packaging and that it is the packaging that will make the product stand out from the crowd and hopefully making a sale. There have been a number of valuable studies offering practitioners principles and guidelines on how to enhance package design for products that target children; however the extent to which practitioners adhere to the principles proposed by academics has had limited attention. This study is therefore aimed at examining the degree to which practitioners implement current knowledge relating to the principles of package design in the context of packages designed to attract children, while simultaneously assessing the relationship between package design and brand performance. An extensive secondary research of the literature has been made to establish a list of criterion for package design for children elements assessment. At the same time, attempts have been made to gather brand performance data. Product samples have been collected from major supermarkets in New Zealand and then analysed against the criterion using the principle of content analysis. The result generated by this study shows that practitioners are mostly adhering to the principles of children&#8217;s package design established by academic research.

Despite the large number of studies which have examined the effects of recasts, mixed views exist as to their usefulness as a corrective feedback technique. The present study has continued the investigation into whether their frequent use is justified and also if learners actually perceive recasts as being corrective in nature. The focus of this study is to explore developmental effects, both immediately following and delayed, of recasts while considering these two key aspects. The primary aim is to explore delayed benefits of recasts while the secondary aim is to investigate whether or not these learners perceived the feedback as a correct version of their incorrect question form. The study involved 34 English as a second language (ESL) learners from various first language (L1) backgrounds who were enrolled in a general English programme, at an Auckland language school. The participants completed demographic questionnaires and took part in task-based interaction sessions, with the members of the experimental group receiving input containing intensive recasts. The proportion and types of questions produced in the immediate and two delayed post-tests were compared and analysed to consider whether exposure to recasts was beneficial. The main findings suggest that for more advanced question types, interaction with intensive recasts may be more effective than interaction alone, for delayed L2 development, despite only weak support in the literature. On the other hand, similar positive effects on immediate question production are not strongly evident. Therefore, the results in this study add support to the claim that recasts may be beneficial for delayed second language acquisition (SLA), when the linguistic target is questions, even when these recasts do not seem effective immediately following exposure. Furthermore, awareness of negative evidence was indicated, which may have contributed, in part, to the positive delayed findings. Finally, these results suggest that recasts can be an effective pedagogical tool in the communicative L2 classroom when providing linguistic feedback in a way that does not unduly disrupt the flow of the interactive task. Practical suggestions for future research were also identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recasts</field><field name="subject">L2 question development</field><field name="subject">Implicit negative feedback</field><field name="subject">Delayed posttests</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/893</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">City centered cycling</field><field name="creator">Reilly, Lyle</field><field name="description">This project explores design considerations and processes involved in the development of sports performance clothing specifically aimed at city cycling commuters.

The ability of events to attract people to a destination for the purpose of attending the event is well documented. However the ability of an event to add value to attract tourists before or after the event is not so clear. In other words, can an events portfolio positively influence the decision to visit a destination at a time when none of the promoted events are scheduled? As a first step towards answering this important question, this study explores the contribution of an events portfolio to a consumer&#8217;s perceptions of a destination and how this influences their decision to attend a destination under these circumstances. The proposed study conducts a protocol analysis based on consumer&#8217;s decision-making thoughts. Each participant was given a choice between two destinations in India. Participants were asked to &#8216;think out loud&#8217; as they made the decision to visit one of two possible destinations, one with an events portfolio and the other without. However, their visit does not coincide with the events&#8217; dates. The results suggest four lines of reasoning utilised by prospective tourists in the destination choice process: 1) destination image; 2) the timing of the event with respect the time of visit; 3) tourists&#8217; level of interest in the event; and, 4) events not listed in the events portfolio might be scheduled during the time of the proposed visit. In course of finding lines of reasoning for cross-cultural issues it was found that culture, architecture, English language usage, and food are the major aspects that tourists consider while travelling to Indian destinations. In terms of the events portfolio, there is evidence of a preference for a &#8216;fit&#8217; between the event and Indian culture.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Event tourism</field><field name="subject">Protocol analysis</field><field name="subject">Destination image</field><field name="subject">Verbal protocol</field><field name="subject">Destination brand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/897</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family management of overweight in 5-9 year old children: results from a multi-site randomised controlled trial</field><field name="creator">Perry, Rebecca Anne</field><field name="description">Childhood overweight is a leading global public health issue. Chapter One of this thesis is a three part literature review of the evidence concerning the issue of childhood overweight and its management. Section One of the literature review describes this issue in terms of Australian and international prevalence rates and trends, health outcomes and aetiology. Sections Two and Three of the literature review examine the evidence to guide effective management of childhood overweight and analyse the thoroughness by which this evidence has been determined and translated into practice recommendations. 

The assumed cornerstones of child weight management are dietary change, increased physical activity, decreased sedentary behaviour, family support and behaviour modification. Recently, the role of parenting skills in the management of childhood overweight has been identified as a promising area of research. This thesis study examined the effect of the addition of parenting skills training to a parent-led, family-focussed healthy lifestyle intervention for the management of overweight in 5-9 year old children (The Parenting, Eating and Activity for Child Health (PEACH) Study). The methodology of the intervention is presented in Chapter Two.

Families of overweight 5-9 year old children across two sites (three cohorts per site) were randomized to either a healthy lifestyle group program (HL) or a healthy lifestyle plus parenting group program (HL+P). Parents in both groups received eight 1.5hour group education sessions covering topics on child/family nutrition, physical activity and positive body image. Parents in the HL+P group were offered a four week parenting skills training program prior to this. All information was directed to parents and they were responsible for initiating and maintaining healthy lifestyle changes with their families. The intervention was delivered over a six month period and group differences were examined at this time point (intervention effect) and six months following with no further program contact (maintenance effect). The sample size (n=169) was calculated to demonstrate an estimated reduction in BMI z-score of 30% in the HL+P group and 10% in the HL group over 12 months, allowing for a drop out rate of one third (power=80%, significance=95%). Intention to treat analysis was conducted using ANCOVA. 

The effectiveness of the intervention was measured against a comprehensive evaluation plan consisting of: 
&#149;	primary outcome indicators (body mass index (BMI) z-score and waist circumference (WC) z-score) (Chapter Three), 
&#149;	secondary outcome indicators (health-related quality of life (HRQoL), body size dissatisfaction and height z-score) (Chapter Three), 
&#149;	impact evaluation indicators (children&#146;s lifestyle behaviours and parent&#146;s parenting practices) (Chapter Four), 
&#149;	process evaluation indicators (participant attendance and satisfaction and maintenance of program integrity across sites) (Chapter Four) and 
&#149;	qualitative evaluation of the factors external to the intervention that supported or inhibited families to achieve their healthy lifestyle goals (Chapter Five).

Analysis of the primary outcomes (Chapter Three) found a significant group difference at the six month time point for BMI z-score (HL: -8%, HL+P: -13%, p=0.005), but not WC z-score (HL: -9%, HL+P: -11%, p=0.39). There were no group differences at the 12 month time point (six months following intervention end and with no further program contact). Application of the IOTF definition for childhood overweight and obesity to the full study sample found that 39 (23%) and 130 (77%) children were classified as overweight and obese respectively at baseline. By the six month time point (n=135), six (4%) children fell within the healthy weight range and 38% were classified as overweight and 58% as obese. At 12 months (n=123), 4% of children remained in the healthy weight range, 35% as overweight and 61% as obese. Children&#146;s psychosocial health and linear growth were sustained during the intervention and maintenance periods.

There were no between-group difference observed for any of the children&#146;s lifestyle behaviours (dietary and activity behaviours) or parents&#146; parenting practices. However, the group as a whole exhibited significant improvements from baseline for scores of diet quality at the six month time point that were maintained during the following six month non-contact period (p&amp;lt0.001 for   0-6mth and 0-12mth) (Chapter Four). Small screen usage significantly decreased for the full sample from 0-6 months and 0-12months (p&amp;lt0.001 for both), however time spent being physically active did not change. Parents in both groups reported improvements in aspects of parenting over both time periods. 

Evaluation of process indicators showed that the intervention was well attended and accepted by families (Chapter Four). Seventy three percent (123) of subjects were retained to the 12 month time point and 44% (75) attended at least 75% of scheduled program sessions. Of the 131 parents who responded to a program satisfaction questionnaire, ninety four percent reported receiving the help they desired and 99% would recommend the program to others. The integrity of intervention sessions was upheld across sites providing reassurance that the program protocol was adhered to and demonstrating a good degree of generalisability. 

The thematic analysis of interviews conducted with parents at the 12month time point identified more references to barriers than facilitators of healthy lifestyle goal achievement (433 vs 375) (Chapter Five). This chapter highlights the contextual nature of family-based interventions and weight management strategies and the need to consider these during program planning and delivery.

Chapter Six concludes the thesis by summarising its results and highlighting how they have contributed to the evidence base.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovarian cancer and diet: from nutrients to lifestyle</field><field name="creator">Fariba Kolahdooz</field><field name="description">Abstract Ovarian cancer is the 6th most common cancer in women worldwide and mortality from this cancer is high, because early diagnosis is difficult (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2006). Thus, identification of modifiable factors contributing to its aetiology is important in reducing the burden of a very fatal form of women&#8217;s cancer. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the association between diet and ovarian cancer risk within the context of a framework &#8216;from nutrients to lifestyle&#8217;. The study examined dietary and lifestyle factors that had not previously been investigated comprehensively in four main areas: nutrients (retinol, beta-carotene, vitamins E, C, and B), foods (fruit, vegetables, dairy products, eggs, meat and liver), diet patterns and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, and body-mass-index). The study used the data from two population-based case-control studies of women aged 18-79 years conducted in Australia 10 years apart; the Survey of Women&#8217;s Health (SWH, 1990-1993) involves 683 cases and 777 controls, and the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS, 2002-2005) includes 1329 cases and 1397 controls. Cases were recruited from gynaecological oncology treatment centres and controls were selected at random from the electoral roll. Detailed information on non-dietary risk factors was obtained using a questionnaire and dietary information was obtained via a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (adjusting for age, parity, oral contraceptive use, education, and energy intake) for ovarian cancer risk were estimated separately for each study with logistic regression modelling and weighted pooled risk estimates for the two studies were calculated using fixed-effects models. Principal components analysis of around 40 food groups was performed to identify dietary patterns in each study separately. There was an increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with retinol intake in both studies (combined OR for the highest vs. lowest quartile =1.42, 95%CI 1.19-1.69), while intake of beta-carotene was inversely related to cancer risk (combined OR=0.80, 95%CI 0.67-0.96). The associations between retinol and beta-carotene and risk appeared to be independent. Liver was also associated with an increased risk; however this association seemed to be explained by the high levels of retinol in liver. Dairy products and eggs are other good sources of retinol, but no clear relations were seen and additional adjustment for saturated fat further attenuated the associations. High vitamin E intake (combined OR=0.73, 95%CI 0.61-0.87) was associated with a decreased risk, but no overall association was seen for vitamin C (combined OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.89-1.27). It is noteworthy that vitamin C seemed to be more beneficial for current smokers than for never/past smokers. For the B vitamins, a significant inverse association was apparent only for niacin intake (combined OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.58-0.82). While there was no association between cancer risk and sources of niacin such as total meat and red meat, other niacin-rich foods such as poultry (combined OR=0.77, 95%CI 0.66-0.89) and fish (combined OR=0.83, 95%CI 0.71-0.97) were significantly inversely associated with risk. In contrast to poultry and fish, high consumption of processed meat was associated with a 24% increase in risk (combined OR=1.24, 95%CI 1.06-1.45). Total fruit (combined OR=0.75, 95%CI 0.60-0.94) and total vegetables (combined OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.52-0.92), specifically cruciferous vegetables (combined OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.63-0.98) and green leafy vegetables (combined OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.67-0.94), were associated with a modestly decreased risk, whereas the inverse association between red/yellow vegetables and risk did not quite reach statistical significance (combined OR=0.84, 95%CI 0.64-1.08). High fruit intake was, like vitamin C intake, somewhat more beneficial for current/past smokers than for never smokers. Exclusion of women who took dietary supplements did not substantially change the observed associations between nutrients and risk. Three major eating patterns were identified: &#8216;snacks and alcohol&#8217;, &#8216;fruit and vegetable&#8217;, and &#8216;meat and fat&#8217;. Significant inverse associations between the snacks and alcohol pattern and risk were attenuated after further adjustment for white/red wine intake in both studies; it thus appeared that the observed association was at least partly due to wine intake. A significant association between the fruit and vegetable pattern and risk was seen only in the more recent study. A diet characterized by high meat and fat was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, although the observed association was stronger in the SWH There was no evidence that the associations between diet pattern and cancer risk varied by women&#8217;s lifestyle. Although there was some variation in the analyses stratified by the histologic subtype of ovarian cancer, no consistent patterns of variation were observed for either study. These findings provide additional evidence that a healthy diet defined by high intake of fruit, vegetables, particularly cruciferous and green leafy vegetables, white meat and fish and low in meat and fat, especially processed meats might be beneficial against ovarian cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diet, nutrient, food group, diet pattern, lifestyle, ovarian neoplasm, cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177954</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIRTHWEIGHT AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CHRONIC DISEASE</field><field name="creator">Issa Al Salmi</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the relationship of birthweight to risk factors and markers, such as proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, for chronic disease in postnatal life. It made use of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). The AusDiab study is a cross sectional study where baseline data on 11,247 participants were collected in 1999-2000. Participants were recruited from a stratified sample of Australians aged &#8805; 25 years, residing in 42 randomly selected urban and non-urban areas (Census Collector Districts) of the six states of Australia and the Northern Territory. The AusDiab study collected an enormous amount of clinical and laboratory data. During the 2004-05 follow-up AusDiab survey, questions about birthweight were included. Participants were asked to state their birthweight, the likely accuracy of the stated birthweight and the source of their stated birthweight. Four hundred and twelve chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were approached, and 339 agreed to participate in the study. The patients completed the same questionnaire. Medical records were reviewed to check the diagnoses, causes of kidney trouble and SCr levels. Two control subjects, matched for gender and age, were selected for each CKD patient from participants in the AusDiab study who reported their birthweight. Among 7,157 AusDiab participants who responded to the questionnaire, 4,502 reported their birthweights, with a mean (standard deviation) of 3.4 (0.7) kg. The benefit and disadvantages of these data are discussed in chapter three. The data were analysed for the relationship between birthweight and adult body size and composition, disorders of glucose regulation, blood pressure, lipid abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases and glomerular filtration rate. Low birthweight was associated with smaller body build and lower lean mass and total body water in both females and males. In addition low birthweight was associated with central obesity and higher body fat percentage in females, even after taking into account current physical activity and socioeconomic status. Fasting plasma glucose, post load glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin were strongly and inversely correlated with birthweight. In those with low birthweight (&lt; 2.5 kg), the risks for having impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and all abnormalities combined were increased by 1.75, 2.22, 2.76 and 2.28 for females and by 1.40, 1.32, 1.98 and 1.49 for males compared to those with normal birthweight (&#8805; 2.5 kg), respectively. Low birthweight individuals were at higher risk for having high blood pressure &#8805; 140/90 mmHg and &#8805; 130/85 mmHg compared to those with normal birthweight. People with low birthweight showed a trend towards increased risk for high cholesterol (&#8805; 5.5 mmol/l) compared to those of normal birthweight. Females with low birthweight had increased risk for high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (&#8805; 3.5 mmol/l) and triglyceride levels (&#8805; 1.7 mmol/l) when compared to those with normal birthweight. Males with low birthweight exhibited increased risk for low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (&lt;0.9 mmol/l) than those with normal birthweight. Females with low birthweight were at least 1.39, 1.40, 2.30 and 1.47 times more likely to have angina, coronary artery disease, stroke and overall cardiovascular diseases respectively, compared to those &#8805; 2.5 kg. Similarly, males with low birthweight were 1.76, 1.48, 3.34 and 1.70 times more likely to have angina, coronary artery disease, stroke and overall cardiovascular diseases compared to those &#8805; 2.5 kg, respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was strongly and positively associated with birthweight, with a predicted increase of 2.6 ml/min (CI 2.1, 3.2) and 3.8 (3.0, 4.5) for each kg of birthweight for females and males, respectively. The odd ratio (95% confidence interval) for low glomerular filtration rate (&lt;61.0 ml/min for female and &lt; 87.4 male) in people of low birthweight compared with those of normal birthweight was 2.04 (1.45, 2.88) for female and 3.4 (2.11, 5.36) for male. One hundred and eighty-nineCKD patients reported their birthweight; 106 were male. Their age was 60.3(15) years. Their birthweight was 3.27 (0.62) kg, vs 3.46 (0.6) kg for their AusDiab controls, p&lt;0.001 and the proportions with birthweight&lt;2.5 kg were 12.17% and 4.44%, p&lt;0.001. Among CKD patients, 22.8%, 21.7%, 18% and 37.6% were in CKD stages 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Birthweights by CKD stage and their AusDiab controls were as follows: 3.38 (0.52) vs 3.49 (0.52), p=0.251 for CKD2; 3.28 (0.54) vs 3.44 (0.54), p=0.121 for CKD3; 3.19 (0.72) vs 3.43 (0.56), p= 0.112 for CKD4 and 3.09 (0.65) vs 3.47 (0.67), p&lt;0.001 for CKD5. The results demonstrate that in an affluent Western country with a good adult health profile, low birthweight people were predisposed to higher rates of glycaemic dysregulation, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular diseases and lower glomerular filtration rate in adult life. In all instances it would be prudent to adopt policies of intensified whole of life surveillance of lower birthweight people, anticipating this risk. The general public awareness of the effect of low birthweight on development of chronic diseases in later life is of vital importance. The general public, in addition to the awareness of people in medical practice of the role of low birthweight, will lead to a better management of this group of our population that is increasingly surviving into adulthood.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">birth weight</field><field

name="title">Addiction Neuroethics: The Promises and Perils of Neuroscience Research on Addiction</field><field name="creator">Adrian Carter</field><field name="description">Drug addiction is a significant problem facing most societies. It is associated with increased violence, crime and mental illness, and is one of the leading causes of preventable mortality and disability in most developed societies, accounting for over 12% of the total burden of disease (Begg et al., 2007). Neuroscience promises to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of addictive drug use, and the harm that it causes, by providing more effective and better targeted treatment of addiction (Volkow and Li, 2005). Proponents argue that an increased understanding of the neurobiological basis of drug addiction will also lend support for more humane social policies. These policies will recognise that addiction is a neuropsychiatric condition that should be treated therapeutically, leading to increased investment in addiction research and treatment (Dackis and O'Brien, 2005; McLellan et al., 2000). Optimism about the benefits of an understanding of the neurobiological basis of addiction needs to be tempered by more critical considerations. Overly simplistic interpretations of what this kind of approach reveals about addiction could result in less welcome consequences, especially if inappropriate use is made of emerging neurotechnologies, such as coerced use of naltrexone implants, population-wide vaccination programs against addiction, or the promotion of heroic &#8216;cures&#8217; for addiction, such as neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation. This thesis examines both the potentially welcome and unwelcome uses of neurobiological research of addiction with the aims of maximising the benefits, while minimizing any unanticipated harms. I refer to this as Addiction Neuroethics. The primary aims are to examine: (1) the impact that neuroscience research may have upon our understanding of autonomy and self-control in addicted individuals, (2) the implications this understanding may have for how we treat individuals with an addiction; and (3) the conditions under which it would be ethically acceptable to use various technologies emerging from this research. This thesis falls into three parts. First, a concise and accessible summary of the key findings of recent genetic and neuroscience research of addiction is provided. This includes the neuroanatomy of addiction (e.g. the mesolimbic reward pathway), the molecular and cellular biology of addiction, neurocognitive changes, and the role of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities. The second part of this thesis explores how neuroscience research may influence the way that modern societies think about drug use and addiction, and deal with those that suffer from it. This section addresses the central question: do addicted persons have the capacity to make autonomous decisions regarding their own drug use? This raises a number of additional questions. How much responsibility and blame should we attribute to addicted individual&#8217;s for their actions? How should society deal with addicted persons, or respond to the harm that they cause? Should society coerce addicted individuals into treatment, and if so, under what conditions? The third part of this thesis examines the ethical issues raised by the use of powerful new technologies that are emerging from neurobiological research on addiction, such as novel psychopharmacologies, depot implants, drug vaccines, neurosurgery and brain stimulation, neuroimaging and genetic testing. The report also considers the more speculative possibility that addiction neurobiology may improve our ability to prevent the development of addiction, for example, by using genetic screening to identify individuals at high risk of addiction and &#8216;drug vaccines&#8217; to prevent these individuals from becoming addicted. This thesis demonstrates that the chronic use of addictive drugs has significant impacts upon key decision-making regions of the brain (e.g. motivation, memory, impulse inhibition) that affect addicted individuals ability to choose not to use drugs. While the autonomy of addicted individuals is impaired in certain situations, and to varying degrees, it is not extinguished. Rather than deny autonomy, we should aim to engage addicted individuals in ways that increase their autonomy. For example, coerced treatment of addiction may be a valid approach to getting addicted individuals in treatment. However we should avoid overriding the autonomy of addicted individuals by offering treatment as an alternative to punishment for some crimes (e.g. theft to fund drug habit). Such treatment should aim to treat a medical condition, and not be a form of extrajudicial punishment. Addiction is a highly stigmatised condition. This can significantly impact upon the way in which neuroscience research is understood and applied. Scientists, clinicians and policy makers must be mindful of over-enthusiastic applications of novel technologies that may be prematurely embraced and promoted to a desperate and vulnerable population without proper evaluation of the risks, or without considering how these technologies may be used once approved. The treatment of addiction should be judged by its efficacy and safety, as for any other medical treatment. Addicted individuals should be treated as any other individual suffering from a medical condition. The thesis concludes with some general suggestions about the directions in which this debate is likely to develop and identifies areas that will require further analysis and empirical investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">addiction</field><field name="subject">neuroethics</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">consent</field><field name="subject">coercion</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179596</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemispheric contributions to language: A divided visual field investigation of semantic processing following unilateral lesions</field><field name="creator">Erin Smith</field><field name="description">The left hemisphere (LH) is accepted as the dominant hemisphere for language processing. There is also evidence confirming the language processing abilities of the right hemisphere (RH), particularly its lexical-semantic processing potential (Chiarello, 1988; Joanette, Goulet, &amp; Hannequin, 1990). The capacity of the RH for language processing is significant to the investigation of language processing following LH lesions. However, the precise neurocognitive mechanisms underlying language processing following lesion remain to be fully elucidated. Subsequently, the overall aim for this thesis is to investigate hemispheric contributions to semantic processing following unilateral lesions, and to explore the significance of the contribution made by the RH. In order to achieve this overall aim, the current thesis firstly explores the hemispheric contributions made to lexical-semantic processing for healthy adults, and then shifts focus to explore the changes in hemispheric processing for participants with unilateral lesions (LH and RH). Comparisons of hemispheric activation between these groups will clarify the underlying hemispheric mechanisms that facilitate language processing following unilateral lesion. This thesis includes four complementary investigations of hemispheric contributions to semantic processing. The first study combined divided visual field (DVF) priming with event-related potentials (ERPs), in order to investigate controlled hemispheric semantic priming for young healthy adults. Two experiments were employed for a between subjects comparison of time-course differences (stimulus onset asynchrony, or SOA, varied between experiments) in hemispheric activation of associated and nonassociated category members. Continuous electroencephalograms were recorded throughout the priming task for each participant, and later analysed with reference to relevant ERP components (N400 and Late Positive Complex). Bilateral N400 priming was revealed for associated category members at both the short and long SOA. There was no significant N400 priming for the nonassociated category member condition. The examination of hemispheric priming of associated and nonassociated category member stimuli over the same time-course was continued in the second study for participants with unilateral LH lesions and matched controls. The second investigation aimed to determine the impact of unilateral LH lesions on controlled hemispheric semantic priming, utilising the DVF priming paradigm with participants following unilateral lesions. This study also aimed to explore associations between hemispheric activation during the online priming task and offline comprehension abilities. Differences in priming were observed between the LH lesion group and the control group, with participants in the LH lesion group requiring the association relationship to elicit priming. Priming also varied for participants as a function of their offline comprehension abilities, with RH priming associated with higher offline scores. The third investigation continued the exploration of hemispheric semantic activation following LH lesion, examining the impact of a LH lesion on interhemispheric control mechanisms, and the modification of hemispheric processing capacities with and without dominant hemisphere control. This investigation again utilised DVF priming with associated and nonassociated category member stimuli, in conjunction with the dual task paradigm. The dual task paradigm is designed to overload one hemisphere&#8217;s processing resources in order to remove interhemispheric suppression. Findings indicate that following LH lesions, the RH&#8217;s contribution is enhanced under conditions that are designed to overload the LH. The final study shifts from the investigation of participants with LH lesions to the impact of a RH lesion. This exploration of controlled hemispheric semantic priming following RH lesion sought to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms for semantic processing following unilateral lesion. The RH&#8217;s role in lexical-semantic processing has been documented consistently over approximately the last twenty years, however, there remains limited direct investigation of a RH lesion&#8217;s impact on contributions to semantic processing. A single case investigation utilised the same experimental procedure as the second study described. Findings suggest a similar activation pattern between the individual with RH lesion and the control participants, with both exhibiting bilateral activation of the associated and nonassociated category member stimuli. However, a subtle difference was found between the activation of the individual with RH lesion and that of the control group, with the individual with a RH lesion showing increased strategic processing difficulties at the longer SOA. Overall, the current thesis demonstrates the importance of the RH for efficient strategic semantic processing for both healthy adults, and people with unilateral lesions. In addition, this thesis concludes that following a LH lesion, the RH contribution to controlled semantic processing may be associated with successful comprehension, and that RH contributions may be improved with the addition of a secondary task designed to overload LH processing. The present thesis provides evidence to support the use of the DVF priming paradigm in the investigation of hemispheric contributions to semantic processing following unilateral lesion. It is anticipated that these findings will improve the current understanding of the underlying hemispheric contributions to lexical-semantics following a unilateral lesion, and will encourage continuing investigation into the RH&#8217;s capacity to impact language recovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hemispheric Contributions</field><field name="subject">Semantics</field><field name="subject">Semantic Priming</field><field name="subject">Association</field><field name="subject">Category Membership</field><field name="subject">Controlled Processing</field><field name="subject">Left Hemisphere Lesion</field><field name="subject">Right Hemisphere Lesion</field><field name="subject">Divided Visual Field</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179598</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren).

However, the majority of SerpinB2 is retained intracellularly, and many uPA-independent activities have been reported for SerpinB2 suggesting an alternate function. This thesis explores the role of SerpinB2 in epithelial tumour cell lines, highlights the problems associated with various expression systems and argues that SerpinB2 has no role in growth or apoptosis of tumour cells. A potential role for immune modulation and angiogenesis is suggested in in vivo models. Previous research using SerpinB2 transfected, clonally selected tumour cell lines suggested that SerpinB2 regulates the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (Rb) by binding and protecting Rb from degradation. Despite the use of two techniques under numerous conditions and positive controls, no significant interaction between SerpinB2 and Rb was found. SerpinB2 was reported to bind Rb through a PENF homology motif located within the SerpinB2 C-D interhelical loop region. The PENF homology motif was postulated to represent the motif responsible for binding to the C-pocket of Rb. Epstein Barr Virus nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA6) is a known Rb binding protein, which contains two predicted PENF homology motifs. However, mutation of the two PENF homology motifs within EBNA6 did not reduce Rb binding. Furthermore, the SerpinB2 PENF homology motif is actually not well conserved between SerpinB2 proteins from multiple species, whereas other regions of the SerpinB2 C-D loop show a high level of conservation. These data do not support a role for SerpinB2 and the PENF homology motif in Rb binding. SerpinB2 has been proposed to have a role in regulating growth and apoptosis. To further investigate this proposed phenotype of SerpinB2, SerpinB2 was expressed in a range of epithelial tumour lines using transient transfection. No change in growth, apoptosis or Rb levels were found. After &#8776;2-3 month antibiotic selection for the SerpinB2-expressing plasmid, SerpinB2 protein was lost without the loss of the transgene, indicating selective pressure against long-term SerpinB2 protein expression. To further investigate long-term SerpinB2 expression adenovirus and lentivirus vectors were used. Infection of tumour cell lines with adenovirus vectors expressing SerpinB2 resulted in reduced cell growth, characterised by increased p53 (but not Rb) levels and G2 arrest or apoptosis. When SerpinB2 expressing lentivirus vectors were used to transduce the same tumour cell lines, high levels of long-term expression of functional SerpinB2 was achieved. However, SerpinB2-expressing cell lines showed no differences in growth, proliferation, Rb levels, or apoptosis induced by a range of agents. Growth and apoptosis observed with adenovirus SerpinB2 had all the characteristics of adenovirus-associated toxicity, which has been reported previously for specific proteins. These experiments highlighted the problems associated with SerpinB2 expression systems and suggest that SerpinB2 expression per se is not toxic nor has a role in regulating Rb, growth and apoptosis. Screening of a number of tumour cell lines identified the HPV16 transformed cervical cancer line as expressing high levels of SerpinB2. SerpinB2 was located both extracellularly and intracellularly with a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. A high molecular weight SerpinB2 species was identified in CaSki cells and was shown to be the N-linked glycosylated species. Sequencing showed the protein to be Type A SerpinB2 and the protein was shown to form an inhibitory complex with uPA. An abundant low molecular weight SerpinB2 species was also identified in CaSki cell supernatants and appeared to be a proteolytic fragment of SerpinB2. Treatment of CaSki with PMA, TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; increased SerpinB2 levels. Lentiviral based shRNA failed to significantly down regulate SerpinB2 expression and increasing SerpinB2 levels with lentiviral expression did not change growth, apoptosis, Rb levels or E7 transcription. Lentiviral expression of SerpinB2 in (normally SerpinB2 negative) HPV16 transformed SiHa cells, also failed to show changes in Rb levels or E7 transcription. CaSki thus express wild-type and functional SerpinB2, but no evidence could found that SerpinB2 effects HPV16 E7 transcription or Rb levels. The data presented identifies CaSki as valuable source of biologically functional SerpinB2. SerpinB2 expression in breast cancer cells has been associated with positive prognosis. Tubo, a SerpinB2-negative murine breast carcinoma cell line, was transduced with lentivirus expressing SerpinB2 and grown subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. SerpinB2 expressing tumours appeared red and were larger than control tumours. Furthermore, SerpinB2 expressing tumours had a &#8776;2 fold higher density of blood vessels when compared to Tubo and Tubo expressing EGFP. Mice carrying tumours expressing SerpinB2 also showed reduced anti-tumour IgG2 responses. These data suggest that a role for SerpinB2 in regulating angiogenesis and antitumour immunity. In conclusion, this thesis challenges the notion that SerpinB2 regulates Rb, cell cycle, and apoptosis and suggests a potential role for SerpinB2 in tumour angiogenesis and immunity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serpinb2</field><field name="subject">retinoblastoma protein</field><field name="subject">lentivirus</field><field name="subject">adenovirus</field><field name="subject">Human papilloma virus</field><field name="subject">th1</field><field name="subject">angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">caski</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184655</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Treadmill Walking at High Intensity During Rehabilitation Following Stroke</field><field name="creator">Suzanne Kuys</field><field name="description">The majority of people with stroke regard walking in their community as very important (Lord et al 2004). Walking in the community is limited by slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity (Lord et al 2004; Patterson et al 2007). Slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity are identified sequela in people with stroke (Hill et al 1997). By the end of rehabilitation approximately 80% of people with stroke achieve independent walking (Dean &amp; Mackay 1992; Hill et al 1997). However, less than 10 percent are able to easily walk in their community (Hill et al 1997). Optimal motor learning requires task-specific practice (Carr &amp; Shepherd 2003). Treadmills offer the opportunity for repetitive practice of complete gait cycles (Shepherd &amp; Carr 1999), potentially providing greater intensity and longer duration walking practice than usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Recently there has been some suggestion that high-intensity interventions may improve walking in people with stroke (Moseley et al 2005). Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in people with stroke have been shown to impact on walking, in particular walking capacity (Kelly et al 2003). Treadmills, commonly used to retrain cardiorespiratory fitness in the healthy population, have been used to implement high-intensity interventions, improving cardiorespiratory fitness in people with chronic stroke (Macko et al 2005). Therefore it is possible that exercise aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness may improve walking in people with stroke. The aim of these four studies was to investigate in those following stroke if walking on a treadmill at high-intensity during inpatient rehabilitation could improve walking capacity without compromising pattern and quality. The first study determined, in an Australian setting, the duration and intensity of usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Study 2 compared walking pattern immediately following overground and treadmill walking practice at the same intensity. Study 3 examined the effect of treadmill walking at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness on walking pattern and quality. The final study, investigated the feasibility of implementing a high-intensity treadmill intervention in addition to usual physiotherapy rehabilitation in people following stroke able to walk undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Intensity in all studies was calculated using heart rate reserve or the Karvonen method. Heart rate is a valid, accurate and stable indicator of exercise intensity due to its relatively linear relationship with oxygen consumption (ACSM 2006). For those people taking beta-blocker medication, the heart rate-lowering effect of this type of medication was accommodated. A target intensity of 40% heart rate reserve was used; as this is the minimum required improve cardiorespiratory fitness (ACSM 2006). Walking pattern and quality were measured in Studies 2-4. Walking pattern was measured by linear kinematics using GAITRite (CIR Systems, Clifton, NJ, USA) and angular kinematics using a 2-dimensional webcam application. Walking quality was determined by observation of the webcam footage and scored using the Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Wisconsin Gait Scale and a vertical visual analogue scale by blinded assessor. The first study found that people with stroke spent an average of 21 (SD 11) minutes participating in standing and walking activities that are associated with reaching the target intensity during physiotherapy rehabilitation. Those who could walk spent longer in these activities (25 minutes, SD 12) compared to those would couldn&#8217;t walk (17 minutes, SD 9). However, the intensity of these activities was low; walkers reached a maximum of 30% heart rate reserve and non-walkers reached 35% heart rate reserve. Using the treadmill as a mode of task-specific physiotherapy rehabilitation, the second study in this thesis found that walking pattern was similar following 10 minutes of treadmill and overground walking practice at the same intensity. The third study found that during walking on the treadmill at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (up to 60% heart rate reserve), many of the linear and angular kinematic parameters moved closer to a more normal pattern and walking quality was not compromised. The final study in this thesis, a randomised controlled trial, found that a 6-week high-intensity treadmill walking intervention was feasible in people with stroke able to walk who were undergoing rehabilitation. Participants attended 89% of the treadmill sessions, reaching an average duration of more than 20 minutes and an intensity of 40% heart rate reserve after two weeks. The intervention also appeared effective with significant improvements in walking speed and capacity following the treadmill walking intervention. Improvements in walking speed were maintained at 3 months. In summary, these studies found that usual physiotherapy in people with stroke was of low intensity. In addition, it was found that treadmill walking was safe and feasible as a means of increasing the intensity of physiotherapy rehabilitation, without compromising walking quality and pattern. Therefore, it may be possible to improve walking in people with stroke using high-intensity treadmill walking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke Rehabilitation,</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy,</field><field name="subject">Gait,</field><field name="subject">Treadmill</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184759</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETIC ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT TRAITS FOR CONFECTIONERY SUNFLOWER IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Yue Sun</field><field name="description">Sunflower is grown worldwide for oil production. In Australia, sunflower is under intense competition from canola as an oil crop. Confectionery sunflower aimed for the overseas snack food market is a potential opportunity for Australian farmers due to its ability to provide off-season supply to the major market located mainly in the northern hemisphere. To serve this aim, new confectionery sunflower hybrids adapted to Australian production system with drought tolerance, large achenes, high self-fertility and rust resistance are of paramount importance. The objectives of this project were to understand the genetic inheritance and genetic linkage relationships of the above traits and also to identify linked DNA markers with the potential for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The inheritance of achene-length was studied in a 12 x 12 diallel and a 14 x 12 North Carolina design II (NC II) mating design. Achene-length was evaluated under three environments for each mating design. Genetic correlation among all five achene-size related traits (achene-length, -width, - thickness and also kernel-length and -width) and 100-achene weight were moderate to high. Narrow-and broad-sense heritability for achene-length was moderate to high and similar for each design. The general combining ability (GCA) and maternal effects were found to be the main genetic factors controlling achene-length and each accounted for around 45% of the total genotypic variance. The inheritance of self-fertility (SF) was assessed with the same 12 x 12 diallel mating design evaluated in two environments. The 12 parents also displayed various levels of SF in addition to a wide range of achene-length. Negative genetic correlations between SF and all five achene-size related traits and 100-achene weight were observed. Modelling achene-length as a covariate revealed that certain pre-pollination floret characteristics represented by achene-length at maturity strongly affects SF in sunflower. When the effect of achene-length was removed statistically as a covariate, the specific combining ability (SCA) effect increased dramatically and became the major factor (other than pre-pollination floret characteristics) for SF determination and accounted for 65% of the total variance. Long achene genotypes tended to have low SF and a positive SCA effect was observed more frequently in F1 hybrids that involved small achene lines. The broad sense heritability was moderate (0.663 &#177; 0.017), while the estimate of narrow-sense heritability was nearly zero. A segregating F6:7 recombinant inbred line population with 239 progeny was developed from a cross between HaR4, a low delta (&#916;), high transpiration efficiency (TE), sunflower line with rust resistance but relatively low SF, and SA52 with all the characteristics in the opposite direction. The population was evaluated in two environments for three TE-related traits including &#916;, specific leaf weight (SLW) and chlorophyll content (CC) and four agronomic traits i.e. days to flowering (DTF), plant height (PlantH), SF and rust resistance (RustR). A linkage map 1074.6 cM in length with 138 SSR and 37 ISSR markers consisting of 19 linkage groups was constructed. Spatially adjusted BLUPs were used in QTL analysis for individual and combined environments. Altogether, 10 QTL were identified for &#916;, SLW and CC at individual environments, and 7 were detected by a combined analysis. Sixteen QTL were identified for 4 agronomic traits and 14 of them were confirmed by a combined analysis. Significant linkage among all three TE related traits was discovered on linkage group 4 (LG4), where alleles from one parent had the same direction of influence on TE which suggested either coupling phase linkage or pleiotropy. QTL for SF and RustR were closely linked on LG13. An F2 population with 502 progeny developed from a cross between Jumbo, a large achene confectionery sunflower line, and RIL25, an oilseed small achene line, was evaluated for five achene-size related traits in a single field trial. Using a subset of 178 progeny a framework genetic linkage map, 899.7 cM in length, containing 128 SSR markers and 23 ISSR markers was constructed with 18 linkage groups. Based on the results of a simulated QTL analysis, a modified selective genotyping strategy was employed for QTL analysis with 178 F2 individuals (128 randomly selected, 25 shortest achene F2&#8217;s and 25 longest achene F2&#8217;s). Altogether 18 achene-size related QTL with small effects were identified. Achene-size related genes characteristically expressed additive gene action although several alleles were partially recessive towards the large achene parent. The 18 identified achene-size related QTL were validated in the same diallel mating experiment mentioned above. Significant marker-trait associations were detected for 15 QTL. In addition to 12 significant alleles detected from the F2 population, 12 additional alleles associated with achene-size traits were revealed after the analysis with the diallel. These markers are ready to be used in MAS for confectionery sunflower breeding. Great steps have been made in obtaining essential knowledge of inheritance and linkage of target traits for breeding confectionery sunflower adapted to Australian production environments. The identified markers can be used in MAS and further enhance the breeding process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confectionery sunflower</field><field name="subject">quantitative trait loci</field><field name="subject">combining ability</field><field name="subject">carbon isotope discrimination</field><field name="subject">specific leaf weight</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll content</field><field name="subject">achene size</field><field name="subject">kernel size</field><field name="subject">self-fertility</field><field name="subject">rust resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Approaches to the Development of Koala Sperm Cryopreservation Techniques</field><field name="creator">Yeng Zee</field><field name="description">The primary objective of the studies described in this thesis was to improve the cryopreservation success of koala spermatozoa for the purpose of establishing a genome resource bank for this species. A defining feature of the studies in this thesis was the implementation of an organelle-specific approach to better understand the causes of koala sperm cryo-injury. The functional attributes of spermatozoa, such as mitochondrial function, plasma membrane fluidity, membrane lipid asymmetry and DNA integrity were assessed as an indication of cryo-injury. Sperm mitochondrial function and plasma membrane integrity were examined by cryomicroscopy using the fluorescent probes JC-1 and propidium iodide (PI) respectively in a dual staining technique. Cooling and re-warming koala spermatozoa were more detrimental to mitochondrial function than to plasma membrane integrity. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was suppressed by freezing and thawing treatments; after thawing, MMP declined significantly during rewarming (from 5&#186;C to 35&#186;C). The distribution of GM1 ganglioside was examined using fluorescent-labelled cholera toxin B. No significant redistribution of GM1 was observed after chilling or cryotreatment. The externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) was examined using fluorescent-labelled annexin V. There was no significant increase in translocation of PS after chilling or cryopreservation. These observations imply that cryotreatment had little effect on plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Koala spermatozoa were incubated in a range of anisotonic media to investigate whether nuclear swelling was caused by osmotic flux during the cryopreservation process. Although the most hypotonic solution tested (64 mOsm/kg) induced the highest incidence of nuclear relaxation (mean &#177; SEM; 12 &#177; 3%), this was not as severe as that previously documented following cryopreservation. Chromatin relaxation is a phenomenon observed in koala spermatozoa, where the sperm nucleus expands due to the result of structural changes in the natural conformation of the sperm DNA/protamine complex. DNA fragmentation was not a primary cause of cryopreservation-induced sperm chromatin relaxation, although in situ nick translation of putative DNA breaks indicated that these increased as the sperm head became progressively more relaxed. Using a Sperm Chromatin Dispersion test (SCDt) specifically developed and validated for koala spermatozoa, a continuum of nuclear morphotypes was observed, ranging from no apparent DNA fragmentation to spermatozoa with highly dispersed and degraded chromatin. A double comet assay was also developed to investigate DNA fragmentation in the koala spermatozoa. Conducted under neutral followed by alkaline conditions, this assay was able to differentiate between single- (SSB) and double-stranded (DSB) DNA damage in an effort to refine the interpretation of DNA damage in mature koala spermatozoa; the majority of the koala spermatozoa had nuclei with DNA abasic-like residues. The ubiquity of these residues suggested that constitutive alkali-labile sites are part of the structural configuration of the koala sperm nucleus. Spermatozoa with &#8220;true&#8221; DNA fragmentation exhibited a continuum of comet morphologies, ranging from a more severe form of alkaline-susceptible DNA, to nuclei that exhibited both SSB and DSB. Swelling of koala sperm chromatin following cryopreservation has largely been attributed to the absence of inter-molecular disulphide cross-linkages in the marsupial sperm nucleus. Fish spermatozoa also lack disulphide bonds within their chromatin, but nevertheless, have been successfully cryopreserved. To examine the hypothesis that the cryoprotectants used for fish sperm cryopreservation will confer a similar degree of protection on koala spermatozoa, various concentrations of five cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and dimethylacetamide) were evaluated. Each treatment was compared against an established koala sperm cryopreservation protocol that uses 14% glycerol. Dimethylacetamide at a concentration of 12.5% (v/v) was found to be comparable to glycerol in the successful cryopreservation of koala spermatozoa although high inter-male variability was observed. However, when the new protocol was subsequently validated for a larger population of captive koalas (n = 22), glycerol emerged the better cryoprotectant with respect to all sperm viability parameters assessed except for that of the incidence of chromatin relaxation, which was not affected by the cryoprotectant. Significant difference was also observed in the post-thaw survival of spermatozoa from different animals, which was independent of pre-freeze semen quality. Based on post-thaw semen viability parameters, the koalas could be divided into two distinct groups, where one group had significantly higher sperm viability compared to the other group, regardless of cryoprotectant used. Positive correlation between motility and MMP was observed before and after cryopreservation. However, cryopreservation significantly reduced the dependency between these variables (P &lt; 0.001), suggesting that cryopreservation reduced the dependency between mitochondrial function and motility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marsupial, spermatozoa, cryopreservation, mitochondrial function, cryodamage, DNA fragmentation, chromatin relaxation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186352</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legitimation of violence against women in Colombia: A feminist critical discourse analytic study</field><field name="creator">Laura Tolton</field><field name="description">This study analyses the legitimation of violence against women in Colombia, using critical discourse analysis to explore attitudes related to violence, gender, and power. Internet forums from the website of the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo provide everyday examples of talk about two incidents of violence against women (VAW), a sexual assault and a wife-beating, both of which triggered a large scale reaction from the Colombian public. Colombia is a unique context to study the normalisation of VAW. This nation has been characterised by high levels of violence over the last sixty years, suffering through evolving stages of armed conflict. Militarisation has been shown to increase the occurrence of VAW (Kelly, 2000), and the normalisation of VAW may intensify as well in militarily violent contexts (Hume, 2004; McWilliams, 1998). Critical discourse analysis offers theory and methodology to examine an aspect of life in terms of social justice and power (Fairclough, 2003; Resende, 2009), denaturalising the discursive practices which help to produce and reproduce power relations between social groups (Fairclough &amp; Wodak, 1997; van Dijk, 1993). This study examines legitimation, a social action realised in discourse, which has the goal of setting and reinforcing a certain social order. The project also explores how legitimation in these forums is tied to Colombian culture and the topic of VAW. Drawing on the methods of van Dijk (1988, 1998, 2001) ,Wood and Kroger (2000), and grounded theory (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008), multiple readings of the forums elicited salient themes as well as discursive strategies used to carry out legitimation of VAW. These were analysed in terms of underlying social beliefs prevailing in Colombian society. Dominant themes emerging from analysis of the sexual assault forums include: &#8216;&#8220;real&#8221; violence is more important&#8217;; &#8216;this incident was not a big deal&#8217;; &#8216;it&#8217;s her fault anyway&#8217;; and &#8216;she should have appreciated it&#8217;. These manifest the dominant strategies and structures of contrasts, minimisation, victim blaming, and romanticisation/sexualisation, respectively. Analysis of the wife-beating forums reveals the following themes: &#8216;this is not related to me&#8217;; &#8216;wife-beating is a private issue&#8217;; &#8216;domestic violence is normal and even important&#8217;; &#8216;it is the victim&#8217;s responsibility to change&#8217;; and &#8216;the victim deserves this violence&#8217;. Dominant strategies included respectively: distancing explanations and solutions, discourses of privacy, normalising violence, focusing on the victim, and victim blaming. The forum analyses illustrate how legitimation relates to Colombian culture and the topic of VAW. Numerous elements of culture and topic are used to criticise women&#8217;s agency and suggest that women ought to be passive and silent. In one culture-related example, the Colombian reiteration of violent events works to silence women&#8217;s stories about their experiences of VAW. Another strong element of culture is found in Colombian sayings and proverbs presenting a common knowledge discourse normalising VAW as romantic, sexual and necessary. Discourses used more universally to justify VAW include the idea that women belong in the private sphere and the psychopathologisation of women as attention-seeking and slutty. These elements work together to suggest that women are strong, sexual, and dangerous, needing violence from an authority to keep them uncomplaining and submissive. This work can inform future studies about discourse concerning VAW in Hispanic contexts, sketching in a little-studied disciplinary intersection. As this research participates in the aims of feminist critical discourse analysis, it is hoped that the present study will also be used for critical campaigns aimed at media specialists and educators so that they may create greater awareness and promote change, pointing out and discouraging these discourses legitimating violence against women in Colombia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist critical discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">violence against women</field><field name="subject">wife abuse</field><field name="subject">sexual assault</field><field name="subject">legitimation</field><field name="subject">Spanish linguistics</field><field name="subject">Colombian culture</field><field name="subject">macropropositions</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">online newspaper forums</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203523</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Portfolio of compositions and exegesis: Leitmotifs and their development.</field><field name="creator">Hall, Philip Jeremy</field><field name="description">This submission for the degree of Master of Music at the Elder Conservatorium of Music, University of Adelaide, consists of a portfolio of original compositions supported by an explanatory exegesis.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalisation of Maori businesses in the creative industry sector : ko te rerenga o te toki a tu, he whare oranga : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Warriner, Virginia Carolyn Ann</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study how Maori businesses in the creative industries internationalise products and services. Sub-topics also investigated were the motivators and drivers, the types of support received and the challenges associated with exporting. The exporter, not yet exporter and non-exporter formed the three groups for this study. A mixed-method approach utilising a postal survey and indepth face-to-face interviews provided the data and results for the main findings. Ten themes emerged from the survey results and assisted with interpreting the interviews. An original koru framework was presented throughout the thesis to portray the findings as they evolved. Networking was identified as the preferred internationalisation approach in this study. Of the ten themes, the uniqueness of a product was the most important driver to exporting. Maori tikanga was also relevant as a Maori business driver and presented challenges when Maori principles were incorporated with everyday mainstream practices. Maori tikanga was the only theme specific to the Maori participants, whereas the other nine aspects are likely to pertain to non- Maori businesses in this sector. &#8220;Strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; ties were integral to the participants&#8217; support infrastructure. However, government and its agencies were considered as being unhelpful to the smaller firm. Finance and exporting costs, followed by a lack of government assistance and incentives were the main export challenges for the participants. Another challenge for exporters were in finding suitable agents, contacts and distributors, whereas fluctuating exchange and interest rates were a problem for the not yet exporting group. A recommendation for Maori businesses is to continue creating unique products and to target international niche markets. Government needs to reassess their support policies and provide initiatives especially appropirate to micro and small businesses in the creative industries. There is also a need for government export agencies to better understand and market the uniqueness that Maori and their products offer to the international arena.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">creative industry</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1244</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ewe size and nutrition during pregnancy : effects on metabolic and productive performance of the offspring : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Linden, Danitsja Stephanie van der</field><field name="description">Exposure of the fetus to adverse conditions in utero may result in developmental adaptations that alter metabolism and postnatal growth of the offspring. This thesis investigated the effects of dam size and nutrition during pregnancy on growth, metabolic function and lactational and productive performance of the female offspring to two years of age. Four-hundred and fifty heavy (60.8 kg &#177; 0.18) and 450 light (42.5 kg &#177; 0.17) dams were randomly allocated to ad libitum or maintenance nutritional regimens from days 21 - 140 of pregnancy, under pastoral grazing conditions. From one week prior to lambing, all dams were fed ad libitum until weaning. After weaning, female progeny were managed and fed under pastoral conditions as one group. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy affected lamb growth to weaning, however, after weaning lamb growth was affected by dam size. Dam size had no effect on glucose metabolism, adrenal function or fat metabolism in 16-month-old female twin offspring. Dam nutrition during pregnancy had a minor effect on glucose metabolism and no effect on adrenal function or lipolysis, however, it did possibly affect gluconeogenesis and/or glycogenolysis, with increased glucose production in ewes born to maintenance-fed dams. Ewes born to dams fed maintenance showed greater milk production, lactose percentage, lactose and crude protein yield. Ewes born to heavy dams showed greater milk production and lactose yield. Dam size had no effect on reproductive performance of the female offspring. Being born to a larger dam showed no advantages over being born to smaller dams, for number of lambs born and weight of lambs at birth and weaning. &#8216;Grand&#8217;dam maintenance nutrition increased lamb birth and weaning weight and lamb growth rates of the &#8216;grand&#8217;offspring. Ewes born to maintenance-fed dams could have an advantage over ewes born to ad libitum-fed dams in physiological stressful situations in life as their liver may be able to supply more glucose to support their growing conceptus and milk production to increase the chances of survival of their offspring. These results indicate that it is possible to programme the offspring by feeding their dams differently during pregnancy under grazing conditions. With a better understanding of how offspring can be programmed through different maternal nutritional regimens, it may be possible to significantly increase the production potential of the New Zealand ewe population.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep reproduction</field><field name="subject">Lamb metabolism</field><field name="subject">Maternal nutrition</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1343</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into optimal stock option compensation : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Lai, Eugene Chang Fu</field><field name="description">Throughout twentieth century, it has become increasingly common for executives to be remunerated with stock options, contracts which allow the recipient to buy company stock at a predetermined price, thus giving the incentive to maximize the stock price in order to increase the value of the stock option contract. Not only has stock option compensation become increasingly prevalent to executives at most major listed companies, but also to employees at all levels of the firm, both big and small. However, along with the growth in popularity, stock option compensation also became a topic of contention, not only among the general public, but among lobbyists, legislators and academics. This thesis aims to provide a better understanding of stock option compensation practice, with a particular emphasis on the United States, where stock option compensation is most prevalent. The thesis is divided into three chapters: the first chapter deals with establishing a foundational understanding of stock option practice and possible drivers through investigating the literature on the history of stock option compensation practice in the US. The second chapter develops a holistic theoretical model of an optimal stock option compensation package to possibly explain some practice currently considered as excessive. Then lastly, the third chapter empirically tests the validity of possible drivers of executive stock option policy in recent times in an attempt to identify whether current practice is optimal or not. The first chapter is primarily a literature review, covering a series of events over the history of stock option compensation in the US, ranging from its early beginnings in the early twentieth century until the present day. Included in the coverage of significant events are: legislation impacting tax benefits for corporate and for recipients; &#8220;landmark&#8221; events such as the first case of &#8220;broad-based&#8221; option compensation resulting in companies following a standard business practice; trends in the stock market; academic theory of the development of agency theory which supports the use of tools such as equity based compensation, and the development of major option valuation models; the possible impact of accounting standards; and the possibly impact of major bankruptcies or unethical behavior directly or indirectly tied to executive stock option compensation. The second chapter follows with a theoretical approach to understanding stock option compensation trends by analyzing the major benefits and costs associated with stock options. The model developed differs to most other existing optimization models as it does not focus on one set of benefits or factors, rather a more holistic approach is taken. Using a holistic approach, this model also helps explain how levels of compensation that are considered excessive under an optimisation model based only incentive benefits, can actually be optimal for the firm once other costs and benefits are incorporated. The model also aims to provide an alternative explanation to the managerial power hypothesis to explain why the buoyancy of the market may be positively correlated with compensation levels. This is explained by the impact of the buoyancy of the market on the likelihood of stock option exercise, and the costs and benefits either unconditional, partially conditional or conditional on options being exercised. In addition, smaller companies are also found to benefit from stock options more than larger firms due to some of the unconditional benefits, in particular, the ability to attract higher quality talent which can also help small firms fulfil untapped potential. Lastly, the model also provides useful insight into the appropriateness of using of foregone option premiums as the economic opportunity cost of granting stock options. The third chapter aims to empirically test the impact of several factors brought up in Chapter One that may help explain changes in compensation that occurred at the turn of the century. These major factors analyzed are: 1) the bull market prior to and the bear market following the market crash of 2000, 2) changes in accounting standards for equity based compensation, and 3) possible public perception of corruption following several major bankruptcies associated with poor ethics in 2002. Mixed evidence is found regarding the impact of market cycles. These findings include cycles to be linked to granting options out-of-the-money, a general inverse relationship with the levels of stock option compensation with the buoyancy of the market, expected for companies managing incentives, and finally there are indications companies ceased granting options based on poor company stock price performance prior to 2001. Other findings indicate the possible influence of accounting standards on economic decisions as well as the broad impact of events surrounding 2001-2, even though they have no economic impact. On the one hand, decreases in stock option compensation levels is shown to be linked to accounting decisions, however, there is insufficient evidence to support the argument that firm-wide decision making to cease granting stock options completely was based on accounting decisions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stock option practice</field><field name="subject">Stock option policy</field><field name="subject">United States stock options</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1344</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crowdsourcing the production of public art : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Design, Massey University College of Creative Arts, Institute of Communication Design</field><field name="creator">Denton, Michael</field><field name="description">Many people that would like to contribute at some level towards creating art in public spaces. However little is currently being done to make use of this untapped potential. The difficulties involved with collecting and coordinating dispersed talent often prevents it from being utilized. But now the Internet offers new opportunities to make harnessing latent talent much easier. Successful online platforms (such as Wikipedia and YouTube) demonstrate the potential value that can be derived from volunteers when appropriate systems are in place to utilize their contributions. Jeff Howe refers to this idea of harnessing distributed volunteered effort via the web as &#8216;crowdsourcing&#8217;. Which he explains as &#8220;the process by which the power of many can be leveraged to accomplish feats that were once the province of a specialized few&#8221; (2008). This thesis aims to investigate how an online platform might harness voluntary contributions in order to produce public art. The design objective for this project is to develop an online platform that allows people to contribute towards creating art in public spaces. My research explores the needs and motivations of potential contributors as well as techniques for harnessing voluntary contribution and coordinating group effort. As understanding human behaviour and user interaction is central to this project I have adopted a user-centered approach to research and development. To better understand the requirements of the proposed online platform user research was initially conducted in the form of focus groups with potential users and then via an in depth case study. In order to tackle the challenge of designing an entire platform the process was divided into distinct elements that could be addressed individually. These elements included the core functionality, the brand identity, the structural design, the interface design, and the visual design. For each element I consider what techniques might help to better harness voluntary contribution. The final result provides an online environment for people to get involved with specific art projects around their city. Projects are presented as separate challenges and users can contribute at many different levels such as sharing designs online, attending events, or simply providing feedback</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art online</field><field name="subject">Community art</field><field name="subject">Online community</field><field name="subject">Online user research</field><field name="subject">Website design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::419900 Other Arts::419999 The arts not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1345</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Councils' use of the RMA and LGA in coastal development decisions : towards sustainability : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Resource and Environment Planning at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bell, Angela Maureen</field><field name="description">The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) gave councils a mandate and an obligation to promote sustainability. Along with this it also introduced an expectation that the environment will be better managed than previously. Evidence shows that the environment is continuing to be degraded. This is especially evident in the coastal environment where in the early 2000s there has been unprecedented development pressure. The addition of the Local Government Act in 2002 (LGA) has strengthened councils&#8217; sustainability mandate by stipulating a sustainable development approach and supporting processes and principles. Because the RMA and LGA have a similar sustainability directive there has been a push to utilise the compatible strengths that the LGA offers to enhance the outcomes achieved through RMA decisions, therefore, integrating and aligning the LGA and RMA. This research used case studies, including interviews, to examine how councils use their RMA and LGA mandates in coastal development decisions. The research found that currently there is little integration of the LGA&#8217;s requirements and sustainability direction in RMA coastal subdivision decisions. The case study analysis showed that using the principles and processes in the LGA and also a council&#8217;s policies, strategies, and plans other than RMA documents would provide up to date policy direction and contextual information that would be useful for RMA decisions and could provide a more sustainable outcome if used. The case studies identified a significant number of barriers to achieving sustainability through the RMA, including that much of the policy direction in RMA planning documents is not considered in deliberations. A number of these barriers are also likely to reduce attempts to integrate and align the LGA and RMA, unless they are addressed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resource Management Act</field><field name="subject">Local Government Act</field><field name="subject">Coastal subdivision</field><field name="subject">Sustainability barriers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300903 Sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two novel MYB transcriptional activators regulate floral and vegetative anthocyanin pigmentation patterns in Petunia : [a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand] EMBARGOED UNTIL 12 MARCH 2012</field><field name="creator">Albert, Nick William</field><field name="description">Mr Albert investigated the genetic mechanisms controlling complex floral and vegetative pigmentation patterns in Petunia. He discovered two new MYB transcription factors that control the timing and spatial location of anthocyanin pigment production in flowers and leaves, giving rise to specific colour patterns. He showed that complex pigmentation patterns are formed by tightly controlling the expression of genes required to synthesise anthocyanin pigments and involves proteins that both activate genes and repress them from being expressed. The interactions between distinct classes of transcription factors form an intricate network and hierarchy, allowing fine control of gene expression and strict control of pigment production. These findings will aid in the development of ornamental plants with new pigmentation patterns and also this research serves as a model for how plants control the expression of genes to produce health-promoting plant compounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigmentation patterns</field><field name="subject">Anthocyanin regulators</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Previous studies revealed evidence that this carnivorous, primarily benthic feeder consumes a non-indigenous macrobenthic species. Many non-indigenous macrobenthic species have now become established in New Zealand waters. For example, in Rangitoto Channel, Hauraki Gulf, non-indigenous macrobenthic species are prolific, with three bivalve species in particular having thriving populations: Limaria orientalis, Musculista senhousia, and Theora lubrica. The role of these species in the diet of snapper, however, is unknown. To assess the availability of indigenous and non-indigenous prey species to snapper, benthic macrofaunal assemblages throughout Rangitoto Channel were surveyed. To do so, sediment samples were collected at 84 sites. At 24 of these sites sediment was also collected for grain size analysis and at 40 of these sites the seafloor was surveyed with video. To investigate the diet of snapper, fish were collected from four monitoring sites within the channel. Bimonthly monitoring of the diet of snapper as well as the benthic macrofauna was completed at these monitoring sites and trends in the abundance of three prey species, two of which were non-indigenous species, within the sediment and the diet of snapper were compared from June to December 2008. A detailed description of the benthic macrofaunal assemblages throughout Rangitoto Channel confirmed that three non-indigenous species are established throughout this area. The analyses revealed that the diet of snapper has shifted compared to previous studies. Snapper now consume large quantities of two non-indigenous species, M. senhousia and L. orientalis. Consumption of the former species apparently results from its dominance and biomass within the sediment. It is therefore not surprising that snapper consumed large amounts of this species. In contrast, L. orientalis occurred disproportionately in the diet of snapper compared to its abundance within the sediment. I suggest that the establishment of some non-indigenous species benefits snapper.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snapper</field><field name="subject">Invasive</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="subject">Hauraki</field><field name="subject">Pagrus auratus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/898</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel methods of transduction for active control of harmonic sound radiated by vibrating surfaces</field><field name="creator">Burgemeister, Kym A.</field><field name="description">Large electric transformers such as those used in high voltage substations radiate an annoying low frequency hum into nearby communities. Attempts have been made to actively control the noise by placing a large number of loudspeakers as control sources around noisy transformers to cancel the hum. These cancellation systems require a large number of loudspeakers to be successful due to the imposing size of the transformer structures. Thus such systems are very expensive if global noise reduction is to be achieved. The aim of this thesis is to investigate theoretically and experimentally the use of thin perforated panels closely placed to a heavy structure to reduce the radiation of unwanted harmonic noise. These panels can themselves be vibrated to form a control source radiating over a large surface surrounding the primary source. The problem of the equipment overheating inside the enclosure is alleviated because the holes in the panels still allow natural cooling. An initial study is carried out to determine the resonance frequencies of perforated panels. The use of previously determined effective elastic properties of the panels and Finite Element Analysis to theoretically calculate their resonance frequencies is examined. Secondly the attenuation provided by active noise control using perforated panels as control sources is explored by use of a coupled analysis, where the primary source is assumed to influence the radiation of the perforated control panel. This analysis was found to predict poorly the amount of attenuation that could be achieved, so an uncoupled analysis is undertaken, where both the primary and control sources are assumed to radiate independently of each other. Not only does this greatly simplify the theoretical analysis but it also enables prediction of attenuation levels which are comparable to those determined experimentally. The theoretical model is reformulated to enable comparison of the sound power attenuation provided by perforated panel control sources with that of traditional acoustic and structural control sources. Finally, the use of modal filtering of traditional acoustic error sensor signals to give transformed mode (or power mode) sensors is examined. The independently radiating acoustic transformed modes of the panel are determined by an eigenanalysis and a theoretical analysis is presented for a farfield acoustic power sensor system to provide a direct measurement of the total radiated acoustic power. The frequency dependence of the sensor system, and the amount of global sound power attenuation that can be achieved is examined. Experimental measurements are made to verify the theoretical model and show that a sound power sensor implemented with acoustic sensors can be used in a practical active noise control system to increase the amount of attenuation that can be achieved. Alternatively the sound power sensor can be used to reduce the number of error channels required by a control system to obtain a given level of attenuation when compared to traditional error criteria. The power mode sensor analysis is then applied to the perforated panel control system, with similar results.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Active noise control, Transformers, Perforated panels</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37932</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand migrants to Australia :social construction of migrant identity</field><field name="creator">Green, Alison E.</field><field name="description">New Zealanders&#8217; motivations for migrating to Australia and the effect of migration on their cultural and national identity were examined through analysis of interviews and surveys with New Zealand migrants and stayers. Factors influencing the move included economic pull factors, lifestyle factors, family reunification, some dissatisfaction with New Zealand society, the desire for a change, and a sense of adventure. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with their new lives in Australia, and once resident there, initial motivating reasons merged with factors which reinforced and justified the decision to move. These included the benefits of a warmer climate, the perception that Australia was a more relaxed and tolerant society, and the belief by Maori that living in Australia freed them from negative stereotypes.New Zealand migrants to Australia revised their identity in light of their new experiences, and yet continued to view New Zealand positively, retaining aspects of their New Zealand identity as part of their ongoing evolving identity. However, while feeling at home in both countries, as time went on many migrants adopted a more Australian identity. Over time, they considered Australia was superior in a number of respects, and adapted and changed in response to Australian influences. Despite this, migrants maintained the boundary between New Zealand and Australian characteristics through a process of constant comparisons and, somewhat ambivalently, retained their strong positive regard for New Zealand. In the main, participants considered they could be happy in either country, but were happier in Australia. Migrants constructed positive reasons to justify their move and viewed themselves as adventurous and determined, while stayers constructed equally positive reasons for staying in New Zealand, seeing themselves as settled and stable.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Australia Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Sociology, Demography (0938)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/1</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A flexible framework for leveraging verification tools to enhance the verification technologies available for policy enforcement</field><field name="creator">Larkin, James</field><field name="description">Program verification is vital as more and more users are creating, downloading and executing foreign computer programs. Software verification tools provide a means for determining if a program adheres to a user&#8217;s security requirements, or security policy. There are many verification tools that exist for checking different types of policies on different types of programs. Currently however, there is no verification tool capable of determining if all types of programs satisfy all types of policies. This thesis describes a framework for supporting multiple verification tools to determine program satisfaction. A user&#8217;s security requirements are represented at multiple levels of abstraction as Intermediate Execution Environments. Using a sequence of configurations, a user&#8217;s security requirements are transformed from the abstract level to the tool level, possibly for multiple verification tools.

As a result, it was concluded that negative emotions were associated with more systematic processing and positive emotions were related to more heuristic processing (Tiedens and Linton, 2001). However, recent studies of the effects of emotions on consumer decision-making have shown that emotions with the same valence and arousal level can lead to different response behaviours (Lerner and Keltner, 2000; Ragunathan and Pham, 1999; Tiedens and Linton, 2001; Yi and Baumgartner, 2004). Cognitive appraisals have been offered as an avenue for explaining these differences (Bagozzi, Gopinath and Nyer, 1999; Ruth, Brunel and Otnes, 2002; Tiedens and Linton, 2001); however, a comprehensive theory of their effects on decision-making has yet to emerge. This three study research program tests whether the cognitive appraisals of outcome desirability and agency combine to offer a more comprehensive explanation of emotion&#8217;s effect on consumer decision-making processes than has been offered to date. Outcome desirability and agency are proposed to influence decision-making processes both directly and through the mediating influence of emotions. Results show that emotions mediate relationships between outcome desirability and agency appraisals and consumer decision-making processes. There is some evidence to suggest that agency driven emotions differentially influence consumer decision-making processes and outcomes. Further study is needed to confirm how these complex interactions work together to drive decision-making behaviours.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer behavior</field><field name="subject">Decision making psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Marketing psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/watson</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Wu, Chen-Huan</field><field name="description">This thesis not only seeks to demonstrate the requirements of and procedures for recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in the Republic of China (ROC), but also explores whether ROC&#8217;s legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards comply with international &#8216;best practice&#8217; standards as contained in the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (UNCITRAL Model Law. Even though ROC&#8217;s former legislation and practices did not conform to these standards, the present legislation and practices do comply with the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Although ROC and the People&#8217;s Republic of China (PRC) both insist on a &#8216;one China&#8217; policy and each claims that it represents the whole of China, each has its own legal system. Nonetheless, ROC adopted the &#8216;regional conflict of laws&#8217; theory based on the concept of &#8216;one country, two regions&#8217; to deal with cases relating to recognition and enforcement arbitral awards rendered in PRC. In the context of that theory, this thesis explores the requirements of and procedures for recognition and enforcement of PRC arbitral awards in ROC, and whether there are any deficiencies in this regard. The thesis concludes that the ROC legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of PRC arbitral awards in ROC are consistent with the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. The government of PRC resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao from 1 July 1997 and 20 December 1999 respectively. However, PRC adopted the principle of &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217;. PRC authorizes the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR) and the Macao Special Administrative Region (Macao SAR) to exercise a high degree of autonomy and to enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial, including that of final adjudication. Thus, the ROC legislation deems that Hong Kong and Macao arbitral awards are foreign arbitral awards in ROC. So, the legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of Hong Kong arbitral awards and Macao arbitral awards also are in conformity with the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Moreover, the legislation and practices regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign, PRC, Hong Kong, and Macao arbitral awards go further than international standards set out by the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law. Applying for recognition or enforcement of a foreign, PRC, Hong Kong, or Macao arbitral award, an original arbitration agreement or an original arbitral award can be substituted by an electronic format, which was made originally and can show the whole text as well as can be downloaded for examination. Furthermore, the courts of ROC construe the limitations regarding recognition or enforcement foreign, PRC, Hong Kong, or Macao arbitral awards narrowly. In addition, even though the ROC legislation regarding recognition and enforcement of foreign, Hong Kong, and Macao arbitral awards adopts the principle of reciprocity, the ROC Courts adopt the notion of comity. The thesis clarifies recognition and enforcement of PRC arbitral awards in Hong Kong, and recognition and enforcement of Hong Kong arbitral awards in PRC as well. Hong Kong arbitral awards are enforceable in PRC, and PRC arbitral awards also are enforceable in Hong Kong in accordance with the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards Between Mainland and the Hong Kong SAR 2000 (PRC) and the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance 2000 (Hong Kong SAR) respectively based on the principle of &#8216;one country, two systems&#8217;. Both the provisions of the Arrangement Concerning Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards Between Mainland and the Hong Kong SAR 2000 (PRC) and the Arbitration (Amendment) Ordinance 2000 (Hong Kong SAR) comply with the international standards set out in the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conflict of laws</field><field name="subject">Arbitration and award</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/wu</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is it because I'm gay? :the effect of sexual orientation on perceived discrimination: a cross-cultural study</field><field name="creator">Kim, Sarang</field><field name="description">Previous research have theorized that causes of the psychological distress faced by lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs) are stigma and discrimination they face in the society. Perceptions of discrimination, whether it actually occurs or not, also affect behaviours. This project investigated whether non-heterosexuals (LGBs) perceive more discrimination than do heterosexuals in the same given situations. In Study 1, LGBs&#8217; levels of perceived discrimination in non-discriminatory situations (those where no actual discrimination took place) were compared with the responses of heterosexuals. In addition, Study 1 also examined which psychological well-being related variables (internalized  heterosexism (homophobia), marginalization, isolation, alienation, self-esteem, and satisfaction with life) contributed most to perceptions of discrimination. Five hundred and sixty adults (355 Korean, 205 Australian) participated in the study through an online survey. Major findings were: only the Australian LGBs but not the Korean LGBs showed significantly higher levels of perceived discrimination than did heterosexual counterparts. Using a priming stimulus did not increase the perception of discrimination; heterosexuals were more aware of others knowing their sexual orientation than LGBs. Alienation was the variable that most related to perceived discrimination. Study 1 had used only situations where no actual discrimination was included or intended. This study also showed that there were a number of differences between the Australian and Korean samples: Korean LGBs had significantly lower psychological well-being; and most of the Korean LGBs were in Stage 4 (acceptance) whereas the majority of Australian LGBs were in Stage 6 (synthesis). Further cross-cultural studies are needed. Study 2 examined the responses of perceived discrimination using an actual discriminatory scenario and a non-discriminatory scenario. It also examined the relationships between outness and perceived discrimination; and between previous experience of discrimination and perceived discrimination. Sixty six Australian university students (44 females, 21 males, and one gender unidentified) participated in this second study. Major findings were: significant differences were found in perceived discrimination between the nondiscriminatory and discriminatory scenario situations for all participants, between heterosexuals and LGBs, between lesbians and heterosexual women, but not between lesbian women and gay men. No correlation was found between outness and perceived discrimination in either the discriminatory or the non-discriminatory situations. However, previous experience of discrimination was correlated sharply with perceptions of discrimination in both scenarios.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homophobia Australia</field><field name="subject">Gays Australia</field><field name="subject">Gays Korea</field><field name="subject">Homophobia Korea</field><field name="subject">Sociology, General (0626)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/3</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure information flow for inter-organisational collaborative environments</field><field name="creator">Bracher, Shane</field><field name="description">Collaborative environments allow users to share and access data across networks spanning multiple administrative domains and beyond organisational boundaries. This poses several security concerns such as data confidentiality, data privacy and threats to improper data usage. Traditional access control mechanisms focus on centralised systems and implicitly assume that all resources reside in the one domain. This serves as a critical limitation for inter-organisational collaborative environments, which are characteristically decentralised, distributed and heterogeneous.  A consequence of the lack of suitable access control mechanisms for inter-organisational collaborative environments is that data owners relinquish all control over data they release. In these environments, we can reasonably consider more complex cases where documents may have multiple contributors, all with differing access control requirements. Facilitating such cases, as well as maintaining control over the document&#8217;s content, its structure and its flow path as it circulates through multiple administrative domains, is a non-trival issue.  This thesis proposes an architecture model for specifying and enforcing access control restrictions on sensitive data that follows a pre-defined inter-organisational workflow. Our approach is to embed access control enforcement within the workflow object (e.g. the circulating document containing sensitive data) as opposed to relying on each administrative domain to enforce the access control policies. The architecture model achieves this using cryptographic access control &#8211; a concept that relies on cryptography to enforce access control policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer security</field><field name="subject">Cryptography</field><field name="subject">Computers Access control.</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/11</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value creation in a virtual world</field><field name="creator">Hales, Kieth R</field><field name="description">During the past two decades, increasingly powerful and capable information technologies have made information more accessible and valuable so that it has become the prime resource for business; ahead of the traditional resources of land, labour and capital. Improved information acquisition, usage and distribution has also driven and enabled globalisation. The emergence of the virtual enterprise (VE) is one consequence of changed market conditions and advanced information communications technology (ICT). VE s are characterised by various configurations of networks of collaborating partnerships and intensive ICT linkages. As ICT has become more pervasive, businesses have become increasingly reliant on it for their effective operation so now the question for business strategists is how to create value and sustainable competitive advantage in a virtual world? This thesis offers an answer to that question.This thesis uses rational arguments drawn from a wide variety of research from both the business and ICT disciplines to examine the theoretical foundations of value creation. It explores the development of corporate strategy and value driven sources of competitive advantage from the viewpoints of industrial organisation (IO), the resource based view (RBV) of the firm, innovation, transaction cost economics, network theory and value and supply chains. However, these established strategy theories, whose origins often predate the internet, do not adequately accommodate the expanded roles that information and digital technologies play in creating value in an increasingly digital environment. Alternately, Information Systems research, which is rich in information technology, struggles to accommodate the notion of value as legitimate information systems goal. Virtual organisation (VO) is a new strategic paradigm that is centred on the use of information and ICT to create value. VO is presented as a meta-management strategy that has application in all value oriented organisations. Within the concept of VO, the business model is an ICT based construct that bridges and integrates enterprise strategic and operational concerns.The Virtual Value Creation (VVC) framework is an innovative and novel business model that draws on the concept of virtual organisation. The VVC&#8217;s objective is to provide enterprises with a framework to determine their present and potential capability to use available information to create economic value. It owes its inspiration to Porter and Drucker, both of whom emphasised value creation as the legitimate focus for enterprise activity and the source of sustainable competitive advantage. The VVC framework integrates existing and emerging theories to describe the strategic processes and conditions necessary for the exploitation of information in a commercial setting.The VVC framework presently represents a novel and valuable tool that enterprises can use to assess their present and potential use of information to create value in a virtual age.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virtual enterprise</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">value creation</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/hales</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solution biases and pheromone representation selection in ant colony optimisation</field><field name="creator">Montgomery, James</field><field name="description">Combinatorial optimisation problems (COPs) pervade human society: scheduling, design, layout, distribution, timetabling, resource allocation and project management all feature problems where the solution is some combination of elements, the overall value of which needs to be either maximised or minimised (i.e., optimised), typically subject to a number of constraints. Thus, techniques to efficiently solve such problems are an important area of research. A popular group of optimisation algorithms are the metaheuristics, approaches that specify how to search the space of solutions in a problem independent way so that high quality solutions are likely to result in a reasonable amount of computational time. Although metaheuristic algorithms are specified in a problem independent manner, they must be tailored to suit each particular problem to which they are applied. This thesis investigates a number of aspects of the application of the relatively new Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) metaheuristic to different COPs.The standard ACO metaheuristic is a constructive algorithm loosely based on the foraging behaviour of ant colonies, which are able to find the shortest path to a food source by indirect communication through pheromones. ACO&#8217;s artificial pheromone represents a model of the solution components that its artificial ants use to construct solutions. Developing an appropriate pheromone representation is a key aspect of the application of ACO to a problem. An examination of existing ACO applications and the constructive approach more generally reveals how the metaheuristic can be applied more systematically across a range of COPs. The two main issues addressed in this thesis are biases inherent in the constructive process and the systematic selection of pheromone representations.The systematisation of ACO should lead to more consistently high performance of the algorithm across different problems. Additionally, it supports the creation of a generalised ACO system, capable of adapting itself to suit many different combinatorial problems without the need for manual intervention.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Combinatorial optimisation problems</field><field name="subject">metaheuristic algorithms</field><field name="subject">Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/montgomery</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation and behavioural explanation of family businesser functioning</field><field name="creator">Craig, Justin B</field><field name="description">This research investigated the causes of behavioural difficulties among family businessers in two studies. Study one adapted the evolutionary theory of the firm to the family business context in an empirical study that involved 370 family businessers from 46 families. The study found that: (1) stakeholder cohorts within the family (employed by the business versus not employed by the business; owners of stock versus non stock owners; related to founder versus not related; male versus female) were significantly divided on business direction and planning, the introduction of new routines to the business and various roles, habits, norms and codes that made up the collective knowledge base of the firm; (2) the founding generation reported significantly higher levels of individualism and self-belief than second and third generation family businessers; and (3) the founding generation differed significantly to the third (but not the second) generation on business direction and planning related matters.The second study was a single case design study involving two second-generation family businessers and one third-generation family businesser from three separate family businesses. Using the Skinnerian theory-based technique of functional assessment and the recently formulated Valued Outcomes Analysis (VOA) each individual&#8217;s behaviour was analyzed after an initial interview. From this analysis, causes of behaviour were derived and presented to each participant with suggestions for behaviour change. As a result of adopting the suggestions, each individual reported improved functioning at a second interview conducted after a five-week lapse. It was found that individual functioning in family business could be improved by establishing (1) the function of the behaviour, and (2) the valued outcomes that drive the behaviour.

The current research was designed to investigate the types of written errors ESL teachers corrected and the types of error treatment methods they used to correct those errors in the context of Bond University on the Cold Coast. Moreover, it was intended to highlight the relationship between the literature and actual practice in terms of error treatment of written work. In this study, sixty-six students&#8217; written texts corrected by nine different teachers were collected and examined. The teachers&#8217; treatment of the learner errors found in each sample were identified and classified according to their features. The findings from both quantitative and qualitative data on the patterns of error treatment were analysed, and following this, various comparisons were made. The results of the study indicated that despite the current trend of language teaching, error treatment was frequently provided by the teachers in the ESL classrooms. Moreover, the teachers constantly corrected the deviations of local aspects of the language, which did not seriously influence the intelligibility. In addition, the results of the study also demonstrated that the teachers used both explicit types and implicit types of correction methods in a hybrid manner, and they altered their mode of correction depending on the types of errors. They tended to provide explicit correction for wrong vocabulary and sentence construction errors whereas other surface features, such as grammatical and mechanical errors were generally highlighted with implicit correction, especially with correction codes. The findings of this study suggest that increasing the use of less-time consuming error treatment methods for rule-governed lexical errors and educating learners to be able to carry out self-correction could reduce the teachers&#8217; burden of written error treatment. Moreover, constant information exchange would allow the teachers to revise, refine and change their ways to deal with errors. Until clear effectiveness of certain patterns of error treatment is proven by further studies, these suggestions could be made in order to maximise the benefits of the teachers&#8217; treatment of written errors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language study and teaching evaluation</field><field name="subject">English language written</field><field name="subject">Language, General (0679)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/hashimoto</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative analysis of the corporate governance legislative frameworks in Australia and Jordan measured against the OECD Principles of Corporate Governance 2004 as an international benchmark</field><field name="creator">Sharar, Zain</field><field name="description">In recent years, countries across the globe have come to realise the importance of an official corporate governance regime, which provides a platform for market integrity and efficiency, as well as facilitating economic growth. Formulating effective corporate governance measures is a complex task for legislators. The purpose of this paper is to provide an in depth analysis and comparison of the corporate governance legislative frameworks in Australia and Jordan. In 2004, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in conjunction with national and international governmental organisations, finalised a universal set of corporate governance principles. Although non-binding, the OECD Principles 2004 are a serious attempt to strengthen every aspect of corporate governance and, accordingly, have been utilised in this paper as an international benchmark.The ultimate objective of this paper is to formulate a number of detailed and specific recommendations to the Jordanian Government. Jordan&#8217;s legislative framework for corporations received a significant shake-up a decade ago when the Jordanian Government began the process of implementing a privatisation program under the guidance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Despite a number of positive developments since this program was initiated, the Jordanian Government has continually failed to recognise the importance of promoting good corporate governance. There can be no doubt that the Jordanian companies&#8217; legislation is in desperate need of reform. The vast majority of the provisions are ambiguous and lack the necessary detail to regulate the complex sphere of company law. In this writer&#8217;s opinion, the relevant authorities in Jordan must act immediately to bring the country&#8217;s legislative regime into line with internationally recognised standards and practices. Chapter 1 of the paper sets out an introductory explanation of corporate governance and corporate structure. Chapter 2 provides a brief account of the history of company law in Jordan and a description of the different types of company structures permitted under the relevant Jordanian legislation. Chapter 3 provides a detailed discussion of the corporate governance principles formulated by the OECD. The process began in 1999 and was completed in 2004 after extensive revision and consultation. Chapter 4, the core part of the paper, presents a comparative analysis of the implementation of the OECD principles in Australia and Jordan. Chapter 5 provides an explanation and analysis of two important shareholders&#8217; remedies in the Australian companies&#8217; legislation that do not exist in Jordan. Finally, Chapter 6 provides a summary of analysis and sets out a list of recommendations to the Jordanian Government.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance Jordan</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance Australia</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/sharar</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The value relevance of enterprise resource planning information</field><field name="creator">Wickramasinghe, Jayantha</field><field name="description">The value of information technology investments is becoming a topical issue for corporate governance under the recent regulations enacted in the US (Sarbanes Oxley Act, US Congress, 2002). Increasingly, it is becoming clear that the absence of a definitive approach to evaluating IT investments is an impediment to the governance of corporations. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information systems are a key IT implementation that has been promoted in both vendor and practitioner communities alike as a panacea for informed enterprise performance management. This research sets out a methodology for the evaluation of ERP&#8217;s contribution to enterprise value. This issue is important because billions of dollars of corporate funds have been invested in these systems since the early 1990s. Shareholders and management require a justification of ERP based upon its proven contribution to enterprise and shareholder value.The study develops a theory for the value relevance of ERP information by showing how ERP meets the requirement of a management and organizational innovation. Such an innovation promotes enterprise operations, improves enterprise performance, supports value creation, and increases shareholder wealth. A model is presented for testing the value of ERP adoption. Empirical testing proceeds in two phases. The first phase develops a model for forecasting normal performance. Performance is shown to be a function of autoregressive earnings moderated by macroeconomic factors impacting operations. The latter are associated with the business cycle. The estimated coefficients of the model are used for predicting the earnings performance of the firm. The residuals of actual earnings less the predicted represent abnormal performance. This represents the unique improvement in performance over the prior year after adjusting for macroeconomic effects. The second phase tests the value relevance of ERP information. A returns&#8211;earnings model developed by previous research is adapted with ERP&#8211;earnings interaction terms representing the ERP system&#8217;s effect on performance. Two classes of tests are performed on the model: tests of performance relevance of ERP systems, and tests of value relevance. The former tests ERP performance across several accounting metrics identified as indicators of firm performance level change. The latter tests the market response to these changes in a bid to determine if, in the perception of the market, the changes in the performance level attained to by the firm are associated with ERP adoption. These tests are performed for each year of a 5&#8211;year period following adoption. The results of the tests of performance relevance show that ERP&#8211;adopter firms do not achieve significant abnormal earnings in years 1 and 2 of the test period. They realize significant, negative, abnormal earnings in year 3. In years 4 and 5, they attain significant, positive, abnormal earnings. The tests of value relevance show that the market responds significantly to ERP adoption in year 2 of the test, but not in other years. The early response immediately after the year of adoption would seem to indicate a significant early expectation from these systems. However, this does appear to translate into long&#8211;term value relevance for ERP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Management information systems</field><field name="subject">Business planning</field><field name="subject">Enterprise resource planning (ERP)</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, General (0310)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/wickramasinghe</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Putting the storytelling back into stories : creative non-fiction in tertiary journalism education</field><field name="creator">Blair, Molly</field><field name="description">This work explores the place of creative non-fiction in Australian tertiary journalism education. While creative non-fiction &#8212; a genre of writing based on the techniques of the fiction writer &#8212; has had a rocky relationship with journalism, this study shows that not only is there a place for the genre in journalism education, but that it is inextricably linked with journalism. The research is based on results from studies using elite interviews and a census of Australian universities with practical journalism curricula. The first stage of this study provides a definition of creative non-fiction based on the literature and a series of elite interviews held with American and Australian creative non-fiction experts. This definition acknowledges creative non-fiction as a genre of writing that tells true stories while utilising fiction writing techniques such as point of view, dialogue and vivid description. The definition also takes into account creative non-fiction&#8217;s diverse range of publication styles which include feature articles, memoir, biography, literary journalism and narrative non-fiction. The second stage of the study reports upon elite interviews with Australian writers who have produced works in the genres of journalism and creative non-fiction. These interviews reveal the close relationship journalism and creative non-fiction share across a variety of approaches and techniques. This study also shows how creative non-fiction can improve the careers of journalists and the quality of journalism. The census of journalism programs further reveals the place of creative non-fiction in tertiary journalism education and prompts the formulation of a two tiered model for the genre&#8217;s inclusion in the curriculum. The first tier involves including creative non-fiction in a core journalism subject. The second tier is an elective creative non-fiction subject which builds on the skills developed in the core classes. Through the literature, and the responses of the elites and survey respondents, it was possible to show how creative non-fiction helps journalism students to appreciate the history of their profession, explore their talents and finally to be part of what may be the future of print journalism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative writing Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Non-fiction Authorship</field><field name="subject">Non-fictionTechnique</field><field name="subject">Journalism (0391)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/blair</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade, environment and sovereignty: developing coherence between WTO law, international environmental law and general international law</field><field name="creator">Condon, Bradly J</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the consistency of WTO law with international environmental law and general international law in the field of trade and environment. GATT obligations require trade measures to comply with national treatment (Article III) and most &#8211;favoured nation treatment (Article I) and to prohibit import and export restrictions (Article XI). GATT exceptions permit measures to protect human, animal or plant life or health (Article XX(b)) and to conserve exhaustible natural resources (Article XX(g). This thesis analyses the consistency of unilateral and multilateral environmental measures with these GATT obligations and exceptions. It argues that the Article XX exceptions should be interpreted according to the proximity of interest between the country using trade restrictions and the environmental problem. It argues further that Article XX should be interpreted in accordance with customary international law regarding sovereign equality, non-intervention and the doctrine of necessity. Applying the principle of sovereign equality to WTO rights, this thesis proposes that WTO provisions be designed and interpreted to compensate for the economic inequality of WTO members in order to ensure equal access to WTO rights. Moreover, the principle of non-intervention should be applied in the WTO context to prohibit economic coercion. Unilateral environmental trade restrictions fail both tests. They use economic coercion to intervene in the internal affairs of sovereign States and are available in practice only to countries with significant market power. However, the doctrine of necessity may be invoked to excuse the non-observance of WTO and other international obligations to permit the use of trade restrictions to address urgent environmental problems with which the enacting country has a jurisdictional nexus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World Trade Organization</field><field name="subject">Environmental law</field><field name="subject">International trade</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/condon</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Animals in the landscape :an analysis of the role of the animal image in representations of identity in selected Australian feature films from 1971 to 2001</field><field name="creator">Forscher, Helene</field><field name="description">Despite the salient role of the landscape in the development of white Australian identity, and the prominence of the landscape discourse in dominant film commentary, little attention has been afforded to the function of the animal image as a cultural representational code in the context of the meanings educed. The aim of this study is to examine the animal and human-animal representations in selected Australian films released between 1971 and 2001, and to establish the various ways in which such a focus foregrounds significations which offer new, or more complex, articulations of Australian identity.This study was confined to live-action representations of animals, not necessarily as central figures, in Australian feature films. Within the three-decade time-frame, the films chosen for analysis were selected to provide illustrations of the main hypothesis through a range of narrative themes and genres. The films considered include those recognised as forerunners to the Revival (e.g. Walkabout and Wake in Fright); classics of the Revival (e.g. Picnic at Hanging Rock and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith); Australian produced international commercial successes (e.g. The Man From Snowy River and Crocodile Dundee); as well as films which have fallen off the radar of recent Australian film commentary (e.g. Mad Dog Morgan and Long Weekend), and those that never made it into the matrix of intellectual representational discourse (e.g. Howling III: The Marsupials and Razorback). The films were analysed as open-ended metaphors, allowing for negotiated and oppositional readings. The images and the narratives of the films were interpreted using qualitative methods grounded ontologically in a mixed method semiotic approach. All representational modes were considered: image, symbol, analogy, allegory, metaphor or metonymy. Where appropriate, cultural, psychological and behavioural theories from reception studies were employed to describe or decode textual effects. The discussion addresses overt messages and alternate interpretations. The dominant meanings were considered from the social reflection perspective and where pertinent, analysed through social imaginary theory.The analysis found that Walkabout functions as the seminal text in the study of animal symbolism, human-animal representation and the objective or &#8216;ecological&#8217; perspective in post-Revival Australian cinema. The film introduces a new mode and style of animal representation evident in many subsequent Australian films. Films set around the time of Federation featuring marginalised protagonists and the landscape are found to be nationing allegories, presenting themes of equal import and greater contemporary relevance than those of male representation. More recent films with marginalised protagonists exhibit a shift in focus from the concerns of emerging nationhood to those of Australia&#8217;s emerging cosmopolitanism. In representations of masculinity and the landscape, the privileging of the physical activity of human-animal interaction resituates the texts beyond the customary matrices of patriarchal affirmation and the promotion of a pastoral ethos. Themes of humananimal &#8216;mateship&#8217; and inter-species egalitarianism are identified, as well as the presentation of conflict resolution through symbolic metamorphosis into animality. The films are revealed to be a more complex exposition of Australian identity than previously recognised, marking a distinct development in the progression of national representations towards an environmentally aware ethos.Analysis of the horror genre foregrounds the nexus between Australian identity, assimilation and metamorphosis into animality. The feral/indigenous dichotomy is identified as a key trope in Australian representation and the portrayal of particular modes of human-animal relationships are seen to function as indicators of deviance in characterisation. The discussion also highlights the way in which the privileging of animal representations works to emphasise the universality of the films&#8217; concerns, while simultaneously grounding them in a specific culture and location. Principally, the findings in this study confirm my original proposition that animal-centred readings of the selected films would reveal a rich seam of fresh interpretative possibilities relevant to the discourse of Australian national cinema and identity. I have also argued that many of the cultural significations and thematic nuances offered by the texts have been overlooked or misinterpreted by a dominant commentary which repeats the omissions inherent in the viewpoint of the sublime aesthetic by failing to recognise the codes and conventions signified in the detail of the filmic representations.More broadly, this study exemplifies the ways in which animal-centred readings not only resituate certain texts within the cannon of Australian national cinema, but how depictions of animals and the human-animal relationship function simultaneously as both nationing and universalising tropes. By admitting animal-focused discussion into the norms of Australian cultural criticism and textual discourse, the resulting significations connect the texts with a global contemporary inflection in existential concern: namely that of the relationship between humans and the environment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animals in motion pictures</field><field name="subject">Photography of animals</field><field name="subject">Cinema (0900)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/forscher</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agency Trade-offs in Family Firms: Theoretical Model, Empirical Testing and Implications</field><field name="creator">Yupitun, Mark Anson</field><field name="description">Agency theory is one of the principal frameworks utilized in explaining the family business phenomena. The objectives of this dissertation are to (1) identify the unique agent-principal dynamics that differentiate family firms from non-family firms, (2) determine the effects of these unique agency dynamics on family firm performance, and (3) evaluate these unique agency dynamics within family businesses, as moderated by differing forms of governance and management practices.This dissertation proposes that family firms are defined by two unique and opposing agency dynamics. On one hand, it is posited that family firms are defined by their ability to deploy concomitant forms of relational governance that reduce information asymmetry and associated agency costs. On the other hand, it is posited that family firms are distinctly encumbered with agency costs from non-economic family oriented goals. These distinct agency cost-savings, termed as family gains, and agency costs, termed as family costs, contribute to the study on how and why family firms perform differently than non-family firms.In addition, the study proposes that the ensuing trade-off between family gains and family costs may lead to competitive advantages for family firms in highly competitive environments. This agency trade-off provides a link between agency theory and the resource-based perspective of the family firm.Finally, this dissertation seeks to investigate these agency dynamics among family firms that employ differing governance and management practices. In particular, this study looks at how the agency dynamics of family firms that employ the most concentrated forms of management and governance, manifested as owner-manager led family firms, compare against other forms of family firms. This study posits that manager led family firms, on one hand, have greater family gains and, on the other hand, have greater family costs when compared against other forms of family firms. Moreover, it is proposed that under highly competitive environments, the trade-off between family gains and family costs lead to greater competitive advantages for owner-manager led family firms over other family firms.This dissertation employs cross-sectional linear regression as the primary tool for empirical analysis on Australian business data. In addition, non-parametric testing is utilized to support the above analysis. These analyses are complemented by proper robustness checks to support the study&#8217;s validity.The results from empirical analysis corroborate this study&#8217;s propositions. First, the research suggests that family firms have family gains driven by lower information asymmetries, but have family costs driven by greater divergence in firm objectives. Second, the results indicate that family firms outperform non-family firms, which is consistent with extant family business literature. Likewise, the results suggest that family firms under managerial ownership have greater family gains and greater family costs than other</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family business</field><field name="subject">Agency theory</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/19</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Chinese national identity to Taiwanese consciousness: an examination of the cultural elements in Taiwan's democratization during the Lee Teng-hui era and its legacy, 1988-2004</field><field name="creator">Ching-Ni Liu, Jessie</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of the emergence of democracy and its localized culture in Taiwan during the Lee Teng-hui era and its legacy, from 1988 to 2004. From a Leninist authoritarian system, Taiwan experienced a peaceful transition to representative democracy. The establishment of the first opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), in 1986, and President Chiang Ching-kuo&#8217;s tolerance towards it, had signalled the commencement of Taiwan&#8217;s democratization. Various political opposition movements existed prior to 1986, especially between 1983 and 1986, indicating a gradual strengthening in the public&#8217;s political consciousness. The pivotal event to mark the democratization-localization movement in Taiwan was the emergence of a local Taiwanese, Lee Teng-hui, as President of the Republic of China and Chairman of the ruling party, the Chungkuo Kuomintang (KMT). This occurred when he succeeded Chiang Ching-kuo upon his death in 1988. Local politics henceforth emerged as a major force and KMT factional struggles had begun in earnest. During the democratic transformation that took place in Taiwan in the last quarter of the 20th century, the ruling power of the Waishengren political elite (that is, the Chinese who took over Taiwan in 1945) gradually transferred to local political leaders, and the suppressed issue of building an independent Taiwanese nation became politicized. Furthermore, the KMT itself was undergoing a far-reaching transformation, moving from liberalization, to democratization, to localization or Taiwanization. As a result, the issues of national recognition and the power redistribution of different national groups (from Chinese &#8220;Mainlanders&#8221; to local Taiwanese) had combined with democratization from the beginning. Democratization was assisted by institution-building through regular elections, an associated critical voice from opposition groups, a solid middle class, and the Taiwanization phenomenon itself. While the experience of colonial rule and an oppressive (rather than reformist) KMT may be said to be in the past, and hence less an impetus for action in the present, yet with the addition of a persistent military threat from People&#8217;s Republic of China seeking  Taiwan&#8217;s &#8220;reunification&#8221; with the &#8220;motherland&#8221;, past, present and an anticipated future, combine contextually in the quest for Taiwan&#8217;s integrity &#8211; and hence the acquisition of an identity that is consciously Taiwanese rather than Chinese by default.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwan democracy</field><field name="subject">Taiwan Politics and government</field><field name="subject">Lee Teng-hui</field><field name="subject">Political Science, General (0615)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/ching-ni</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internet censorship offending : a preliminary analysis of the social and behavioural patterns of offenders</field><field name="creator">Carr, Angela</field><field name="description">During the past decade, significant public concern has focused on the use of the Internet to access child pornography and other legally objectionable material. Media reference to individuals involved in such activity typically portrays them as socially isolated &#8216;paedophiles&#8217;, &#8216;perverts&#8217; and &#8216;sexual predators&#8217; whose offence behaviour is encouraged by on-line associations with others who share their interest in this material. Although academic literature does not tend to adhere to the sensationalism of these views, it too suggests that on-line networks may be important in understanding the behaviour of individuals who seek to gratify an interest in legally objectionable material.A major aim of this thesis was to examine the relationship between involvement in Internet based social activity and involvement in accessing legally objectionable material via the Internet. As such, data collected during the investigation of a sample of 145 individuals identified as using the Internet to access legally objectionable material was subjected to a series of explorative analyses. These analyses revealed significant associations between individuals&#8217; use of Internet applications facilitating directed, two way communication (eg. Email and ICQ) during the process of accessing legally objectionable material and indicators of increased personal investment in offence related activities.A second goal of this thesis was to identify variables associated with offenders&#8217; decisions to engage in on-line social interaction during the process of accessing legally objectionable material. In turn, criminological and communications theory and research pertaining to the interpersonal behaviours that individuals engage in during criminal actions, and the characteristics of individuals who make use of socially facilitative Internet applications, was reviewed. Based on the findings of this review, it was hypothesised that offenders who engage in regular interaction with others outside of the Internet environment would be more likely than those who did not to seek out opportunities for interaction in the Internet environment. In line with this hypothesis, further systematic and detailed analysis of the data revealed an association between opportunities for interpersonal interaction in an offender&#8217;s home or work environment and the likelihood that offenders would make use of Internet applications facilitating online social interaction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet and children</field><field name="subject">Internet pornography</field><field name="subject">Sex offenders</field><field name="subject">Pedophilia</field><field name="subject">Social Work (0452)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/carr</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Corporate Governance on Market Reactions to Earnings: A Comparison of A Class and B Class shares in the People's Republic of China</field><field name="creator">Jih, Kevin</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this dissertation is to examine the role of corporate governance in the performance of publicly listed corporations.

These differences are then being qualified as either relevant or irrelevant for the categorisation of individual jurisdictions. This reflects the argument that only features occurring in only one of the legal families can be relevant when categorising jurisdictions. Only such features can be, from the author&#8217;s point of view, specific and typical for their legal family and inherent features of them.The first thing to be considered under this premise is the respective sources of law (Chapter 1). These are in civil-law jurisdictions traditionally statutes and in commonlaw jurisdictions predominantly courts&#8217; decisions. There are, of course, statutes also in common-law jurisdictions and previous courts&#8217; decisions play an important role also in civil-law systems. The differences are not inherent. Furthermore, there are fundamental legal concepts, that is important concepts underlying the respective rules. These concepts may explain differences between the rules. The examination of sources of law, altogether, does not reveal any distinguishing factors.Chapters 2&#8211;5 discuss the issue of attitudes of common-law and civil-law judges to statutory interpretation. Chapter 2 examines the respective methods of statutory interpretation. This does not reveal any differences as to common-law and civil-law judges&#8217; attitudes; for instance, greater adherence of common-law judges to the literal meaning of rules arguably does not exist. As shown in Chapter 3, this is true also in the area of Criminal Law under the special safeguards this subject provides. Chapter 4 asserts terminology causes differences between the systems; this is true even in case of identical terminology which is sometimes being interpreted in a diametrically different way. Moreover, differences can also be compensated for elsewhere in the legal system. Altogether, Chapter 4 does not reveal any inherent differences between the systems. As Chapter 5 shows, there is an ongoing process of convergence between common-law and civil-law systems, which means the categorisation into legal families becomes even less plausible.Chapter 6 shows that the categorisation into legal families is not only incorrect but also highly misleading and that there are numerous scholarly statements relying incorrectly on the family concept. The proposition (Chapter 7) is that it may nevertheless be feasible to structure comparative-law texts according to the wellknown legal families, as these show a common historical background. However, for conducting research into particular foreign legal rules (micro-comparative research), the family concept becomes a misleading starting-point. Insofar the concept should be abandoned or, at least, used only together with an appropriate warning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil law</field><field name="subject">Common law</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/landskron</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public policy in the judicial enforcement of arbitral awards: lessons for and from Australia</field><field name="creator">Ma, Winnie</field><field name="description">Judicial enforcement of arbitral awards is necessary where there is no voluntary compliance by the relevant parties. Courts world-wide may refuse to enforce arbitral awards if such enforcement would be contrary to the public policy of their countries. This is known as &#8216;the public policy exception to the enforcement of arbitral awards&#8217;. It is enshrined in the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958 (New York Convention) and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985 (Model Law), which are two of the most prominent international instruments in promoting and regulating international commercial arbitration.The public policy exception is one of the most controversial exceptions to the enforcement of arbitral awards, causing judicial inconsistency and therefore unpredictability in its application. It is often likened to an &#8216;unruly horse&#8217;, which may lead us from sound law. The International Law Association&#8217;s Resolution on Public Policy as a Bar to Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards 2002 (ILA Resolution) endorses a narrow approach to the public policy exception &#8211; namely, refusal of enforcement under the public policy exception in exceptional circumstances only. The ILA Resolution seeks to facilitate the finality of arbitral awards in accordance with the New York Convention&#8217;s primary goal of facilitating the enforcement of arbitral awards. The courts of many countries refer to this as the New York Convention&#8217;s &#8216;pro-enforcement policy&#8217;, which demands a narrow approach to the public policy exception.This thesis explores the main controversies and complexities in the judicial application of the public policy exception from an Australian perspective. It is a critical analysis of the prevalent narrow approach to the public policy exception. It examines the extent of the ILA Resolution&#8217;s suitability and applicability in Australia, considering past problems experienced by the courts of other countries, the distinctive features of the Australian legal system, and future challenges confronting the Australian judiciary. It examines when and how the Australian judiciary may need to swim against the tide by departing from the narrow approach to the public policy exception. For instance, such departure may be appropriate for ensuring that their application of the public policy exception neither causes nor condones injustice, and thereby preserves the integrity and faith in the system of arbitration. The author&#8217;s perspective throughout this thesis is that of an academic lawyer, as she has not had the benefit of practical experience in this area of the law.The recommendations throughout this thesis are tailor-made for the Australian judiciary. They are Australian in perspective yet international in character. They canvass certain issues not addressed in the ILA Resolution, encouraging the Australian judiciary to participate in the ongoing debate and the ultimate resolution of those issues. In doing so, this thesis contributes to refining the judicial application of public policy in determining the enforceability of arbitral awards. The public policy exception to the enforcement of arbitral awards, or its application, need not be an unruly horse in Australia.&#8220;This version contains corrections of typographical errors identified in the original version of the thesis submitted for completion of the SJD program&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arbitration and award Australia</field><field name="subject">Public policy (Law)</field><field name="subject">International arbitration and award</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/ma</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of earnings management on the value-relevance of earnings and book value: a comparison of short-term and long-term discretionary accruals</field><field name="creator">Whelan, Catherine</field><field name="description">Earnings and book value are commonly used as the basis for firm valuation. However, the reliability of earnings, as indicated by earnings management, may affect its relevance in determining firm value. This thesis investigates the link between earnings management and firm valuation by assessing the impact of earnings management on the value-relevance of earnings and book value.Three different sources of earnings management are investigated: total discretionary accruals, short-term discretionary accruals, and long-term discretionary accruals. Total discretionary accruals are estimated using the Jones model (Jones 1991). New models are developed to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. These models enable investigation of the differential impact of earnings management via short-term versus earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals. The primary proposition is that earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on the value-relevance of earnings and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals.For firm&#8217;s whose discretionary accruals indicate earnings management, the value relevance of earnings is expected to be lower than for firms without earnings management. Moreover, in the presence of earnings management, it is expected that there will be a shift from a reliance on earnings to a reliance on book value in the valuation process. This would be reflected in a decrease in the value-relevance of earnings and an increase in the value-relevance of book value.This thesis provides evidence that earnings management plays a role in the valuation process. A major contribution of this study is the development of models to enable the estimation of short-term and long-term discretionary accruals, thereby extending the earnings management literature by addressing the differential effect of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. The results clearly demonstrate that low reliability of information reduces its value-relevance. This link between the integrity of accounting information and its usefulness to market participants supports the need for ongoing regulatory activity to improve the integrity of the financial reporting process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discretionary income</field><field name="subject">discretionary trusts</field><field name="subject">earnings management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Accounting (0272)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/whelan</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of undergraduate student self-employment intention and the impact of entrepreneurship education and previous entrepreneurial experience</field><field name="creator">McStay, Dell</field><field name="description">Chapter One, introduction and research methodology.

It attempts to define what we mean by this elusive concept and its relevance to human behaviour. The thesis then develops an operational definition of evil that is distilled from the writings of various social scientists. The thesis argues, however, that in addition to merely defining evil, there are three emotive elements that also go towards our preparedness to label an act as evil. The thesis then examines the causes of evil acts. The thesis argues that the interactive causation, of situation and disposition, is the most robust explanation of evil acts. The thesis rejects the notion of the evil person, instead arguing that it is ordinary people who commit evil acts. The thesis then examines the causes of genocide, the most evil of acts, and links this back to the previous discussion of causal factors of evil acts. Germany&#8217;s war against the Soviet Union in World War II, in particular the role of the Waffen-SS is then discussed. The death and destruction during this conflict would result not just from military operations, but also from the systematic killing and abuse that the Waffen-SS directed against Jews, Communists and ordinary citizens. The thesis then utilises the case study of the Waffen-SS to highlight the application of the interactive causation explanation in regards to evil acts. The conventional wisdom that the Waffen-SS in WWII fought a relatively clean fight, unsullied by the atrocities committed by the Nazis, is challenged&#8212;and largely demolished. Focusing on the Eastern Front, the thesis contends that the Nazi vision of a racial-ideological death struggle against Slavic hordes and their Jewish-Bolshevik commissars resonated with soldiers of the Waffen-SS, steeped in traditional anti-Semitic and racist dogmas. In doing so the thesis clearly shows that the Waffen-SS was an organisation that committed widespread atrocities. The thesis then applies the operational definition of evil to the case study and determines that the acts committed by the Waffen-SS were in fact evil. It also contends that the concept of evil is useful in explaining human atrocity. In conducting this examination the thesis provides some insight into the challenges facing society from preventing future broad-scale acts of evil.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evil acts</field><field name="subject">genocide</field><field name="subject">Waffen-SS</field><field name="subject">human atrocity</field><field name="subject">Sociology, General (0626)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/6</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning, innovation and performance in family-controlled manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Australia</field><field name="creator">Dharmadasa, Pradeep</field><field name="description">Organisational learning has been identified as a lasting source of competitive advantage in uncertain environments. Plentiful research has highlighted that knowledge and skills and the capabilities they develop are strategic resources and that effective utilisation of these resources enhances firm innovation and performance. However, in spite of this widespread recognition, family businesses, specifically family SMEs, have not been the subject of previous research exploring the strategic impact of organisational learning on innovation and firm performance. This research, therefore, sets out a theoretical framework drawing upon organisational learning theory and innovation, and explores the strategic links between organisational learning, innovation and firm performance &#8220;within&#8221; family SMEs and &#8220;between&#8221; family and non-family SMEs.  The study was undertaken in an Australian context using a sample of 222 manufacturing SMEs comprised of 104 family and 118 non-family SMEs. The data were obtained from the Business Longitudinal Survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics over the financial years 1995/96 - 1997/98, which provides the most recent available comprehensive longitudinal dataset of SMEs in Australia.  The study involved three constructs: organisational learning, innovation and firm performance. Organisational learning was operationalised using commitment to learning, shared vision, and networking. To measure commitment to learning, three variables, employee training, management development, and comparison of performance were used. Shared vision was measured using the presence of formal planning in the firms. Networking was measured using the existence of external networks. The innovation construct was measured using product and process innovation intensity, and firm performance was measured by growth of sales and rate of return on total assets.  Data were analysed using two tests: regression analysis and the Chow test. Whereas the former test was conducted to explore the direct and indirect effects of organisational learning on innovation and firm performance &#8220;within&#8221; family SMEs, the latter was conducted to compare those effects &#8220;between&#8221; family and non-family SMEs.  Our &#8220;within&#8221; results, concerning the direct effects of organisational learning on innovation found that network relationships positively influenced innovation in family SMEs. With regard to the direct effects of organisational learning on performance, we found that management development and formal planning were positively linked with family SMEs&#8217; performance. Moreover, relating to innovation and firm performance, our research concludes that innovation in family SMEs is positively linked with their performance. In the case of the indirect effect, we found that networks affect firm performance via innovation. With respect to the &#8220;between&#8221; results, we found that whereas the effects of formal planning and innovation on firm performance of family SMEs were stronger than for non-family SMEs, the effects of employee training and management development on firm performance were stronger in non-family SMEs. Concerning networks, we found a stronger effect of family SMEs&#8217; networks on their innovation than non-family SMEs.  Finally, we re-emphasised the necessity of more scholarly studies linking organisational learning with family business characteristics such as familiness, leadership, ownership, social interactions and organisational process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small to medium-sized enterprises</field><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises.</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/14</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Familiness quailities, entrepreneurial orientation and long-term performance advantage</field><field name="creator">Irava, Wayne Jeremy</field><field name="description">Familiness has become widely accepted as the appropriate construct representing the unique bundle of resources arising out of family involvement in business. However as yet we do not fully understand the types of familiness or the conditions that give rise to them and as such familiness remains in need of further exploration. This research explores the familiness construct and its role in perpetuating entrepreneurial activity in the family business through the development and deployment of an entrepreneurial orientation (EO) over multiple generations. The Resource-Based View (RBV) is the adopted firm level framework used to identify the unique bundle of family resources that represent familiness. These resources are then explored for their contribution to nurturing and perpetuating an EO, thereby creating a source of competitive advantage. The research also explores the association of EO to the achievement of the firm&#8217;s nonfinancial objectives. Using exploratory in-depth qualitative case studies of four multigenerational Australian family firms, data was collected via semi-structured interviews, observations, and secondary documents. NVivo assisted with the coding and analysis of data to identify common patterns and themes from both within-case and across-case analyses.Six resource dimensions were found to represent the familiness resource bundle: reputation, experience &#8211; insights and skills, learning,  decision-making, relationships, and networks. These resource dimensions, identified by their prevalence across all four cases, are spread across the resource categories (human, organizational, and process) and thus confirm the widespread potential of the family&#8217;s influence in business. The resource dimensions displayed a paradoxical nature and the ability to manage these paradoxes enabled these firms to exploit their familiness advantages (f+) and simultaneously mitigate the disadvantages (f-). Managing the paradoxical nature was central to the multigenerational success of these firms. Three of the six dimensions (experience &#8211; insights and skills, decision-making, and networks) were instrumental in influencing the development of the firm&#8217;s EO while three other dimensions (reputation, learning, and relationships) were more closely aligned with a market, learning, and communication orientation. The findings also suggest that family firms are better able to address non-financial objectives when they have strong EOs that engaged them in entrepreneurial activities. All interpretations of the findings are integrated into a conceptual model for future empirical analysis.The study contributes to research by identifying six dimensions (familiness resources model) that constitute the familiness resource bundle and through which family influence is most prevalent and best examined within the business. The study suggests that the paradoxical nature of these dimensions highlights conditions that give rise to familiness advantages (f+) or disadvantages (f-) and that managing these paradoxes gives rise to sustained competitive advantage. The study also proposes that the family is most influential in driving the firm&#8217;s EO: by being exposed to internal and external experiences that heighten their ability for opportunity recognition; by balancing the process (informal or formal), speed (fast or slow), and forum (concentrated or collaborative) of decisions; and by integrating and exploiting the firm&#8217;s strong and weak network ties. Finally the study confirms a close association between a firm&#8217;s EO and its non-financial objectives. The study thus encourages family firms to pursue entrepreneurial activity, not only because it sustains their livelihood over generations, but because it also assists in meeting the family&#8217;s non-financial objectives.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Family-owned business enterprises Management</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">Resource-based view</field><field name="subject">familiness</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/17</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and analysis for the 3G IP multimedia subsystem</field><field name="creator">Alam, Muhammad  Tanvir</field><field name="description">The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is the technology that will merge the Internet (packet switching) with the cellular world (circuit switching). It will make Internet technologies, such as the web, email, instant messaging, presence, and videoconferencing available nearly everywhere. Presence is one of the basic services that is likely to become omnipresent in IMS. It is the service that allows a user to be informed about the reachability, availability, and willingness of communication of another user. Push to talk over Cellular (PoC) is another service in IMS that is intended to provide rapid communications for business and consumer customers of mobile networks. In order to become a truly successful mass-market service for the consumer segment, the only realistic alternative is a standardized Push-to-talk solution providing full interoperability between terminals and operators. Instant Messaging (IM) is the service that allows an IMS user to send some content to another user in near real-time. This service works under IETF&#8217;s Message Session Relay protocol (MSRP) to overcome the congestion control problem. We believe the efficiency of these services along with the mobility management in IMS session establishment has not been sufficiently investigated.In this research work, we identify the key issues to improve the existing protocols in IMS for better system behaviour. The work is centred on the three services of IMS: (1) Presence Service, (2) Push-to-Talk over cellular and, (3) Instant Messaging and over the issue of (4) IMS session set up. The existing session establishment scenario of IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) suffers from triangular routing for a certain period of time when an end IMS user or terminal is mobile. In this thesis, the performance of three possible session establishment scenarios in a mobile environment is compared by using an analytical model. The model is developed based on the expressions of cost functions, which represents system delay and overhead involved in sessions&#8217; establishment. The other problem areas in optimizing presence service, dimensioning a PoC service and analysing service rates of IM relay extensions in IMS are identified. A presence server becomes overloaded when massive number of IMS terminals joins a network to request presence facility. Performance models are developed in this research to mitigate such load during heavy traffic for the presence service. Queuing analyses for different cases are provided while instant messaging chunks go through two consecutive relay nodes. The specific factors such as blocking probability, stability conditions, optimized subscription lifetime etc. in IMS environment parameters have been investigated. We have also elaborated models to dimension a PoC service for service providers with regards to controlling PoC session access, optimal PoC session timer, path optimization and number of allowable simultaneous PoC sessions for given network grade of service.In a nutshell, the contribution of this dissertation are: (a) a proposed robust scheduler to improve performance of the IMS presence service, (b) several derived models to dimension IMS Push-to-talk over cellular service, (c) a new mechanism to reduce cost for the IMS session set ups in mobile environment and (d) evaluation of message blocking and stability in IMS Instant Messaging (IM) service by applying queuing theories. All of these analyses have resulted in recommendations for the performance enhancements with optimal resource utilization in IMS framework.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Internet telephony</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/alam</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Choice of law in state contracts in economic development sector: is there party autonomy?</field><field name="creator">Bordukh, Oyunchimeg</field><field name="description">A state contract is a common mode of entry for foreign direct investment, especially in developing states. It can form the legal basis of the investment relationship between a foreign investor and a host government. But, like any other contract, it cannot stand itself covering all aspects of the legal relationship. The contract thus must belong to a specific legal system or a body of rules or principles which is usually called &#8220;applicable law &#8220;or &#8220;governing law&#8221;.Historically, a &#8220;concession contract&#8221; in the natural resources sector was the predominant form of a state contract and it used to be governed by the domestic law of each host state. However, since the 1950s, international investment arbitrations have abandoned the tradition and advanced a theory subjecting state contracts in the foreign investment sector to an external legal system, ie public international law. One of the bases of the theory of internationalisation was the principle of party autonomy that allows parties to a state contract to select any law of whatever country they like. Then, the 1965 Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention)1 formally adopted the principle of party autonomy in Article 42 (1) as the primary choice of law rule in disputes arising out a foreign investment contract concluded between a state and a national of another state.The object of this thesis is to prove that the fundamental problems of party autonomy in foreign investment contracts involving considerations of public and private law issues remain unsettled. It explores the main controversies and confusions in the theory of internationalising state contracts, looking at its historical context. It examines the extent of the application of party autonomy in state contracts such as natural resource exploitation contracts and construction of a plant and infrastructure contracts which reflect important economic development policies of developing countries.In considering past and current problems in the field of international investment law, the thesis argues that arbitral tribunals resolving disputes between a state and a foreign private individual should abandon the party autonomy approach because contractual freedom to choose the law of the contract would disregard the objectives which host states normally pursue through economic regulations such as development, environment and human rights concerns of foreign investment. It suggests a consensus-based approach similar to the rule adopted in the Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Certain Rights in Respect of Securities (Hague Securities Convention)2 and which would produce the desired effect. It recommends that the choice of law provisions found in Article 42 of ICSID Convention would need to be either modified or repealed. In doing so, this thesis attempts to contribute to the positive development of international investment law balancing state authority and private property rights.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investments Foreign (International law)</field><field name="subject">Arbitration and award</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/bordukh</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate Governance, Earnings Management, and the Information Content of Accounting Earnings: Theoretical Model and Empirical Tests</field><field name="creator">Bugshan, Turki O</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this dissertation is to show that corporate governance affects the value relevance of earnings in the presence of earnings management. The role of corporate governance is to reduce the divergence of interests between shareholders and managers. The role of corporate governance is more useful when managers have an incentive to deviate from shareholders&#8217; interests. One example of management&#8217;s deviation from shareholders&#8217; interests is the management of earnings through the use of accounting accruals. Corporate governance is likely to reduce the incidence of earnings management. Corporate governance is also likely to improve investors&#8217; perception of the reliability of a firm&#8217;s performance, as measured by the earnings, in situations of earnings management. That is, corporate governance will be value relevant when earnings management exists. The results of this research support these propositions.In this thesis, the value relevance of earnings is measured using the earnings response coefficient. Earnings management is measured using the magnitude of abnormal accruals as estimated by the modified Jones (Dechow et al., 1995) model. A review of the corporate governance literature revealed nine attributes that were expected to impact on shareholders&#8217; perception of earnings reliability due to their role in enhancing the integrity of the financial reporting process. The nine attributes represent three categories of corporate governance: 1) organisational monitoring; 2) incentive alignment; and 3) governance structure.Although not all corporate governance attributes suggested in the literature impact on investors&#8217; perception of a firm&#8217;s performance, the primary proposition that corporate governance affects this perception when earnings are managed is supported. The primary contribution of the study is finding evidence supporting the moderating effect of earnings management on the relationship between corporate governance and the value relevance of earnings. These results validate Hutchinson and Gul&#8217;s (2004) claim that the role of corporate governance attributes in firm performance should be evaluated in concurrence with a firm&#8217;s organisational environment. Future research should control for corporate governance and earnings management, as indicators of earnings reliability, when using returns-earnings regressions to address a research question.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">corporate profits</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/bugshan</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditor orientation, strategies and tactics in audit negotiations</field><field name="creator">Hollindale, Janice</field><field name="description">This study&#8217;s primary objectives are to establish the dimensions, strategies, and tactics used by auditors in the negotiation of sensitive disclosure issues with clients. These issues are typically addressed at the end of the audit and are the primary concern of the audit partner and senior manager. This study uses the tactics established in the negotiation research to test if auditors use the same groups of tactics, and whether these tactics are related by some underlying dimensions, and their relevant strategies.  Multidimensional scaling found that there are four dimensions to the tactics that auditors use. During negotiations with their clients, auditors employ tactics representing the underlying dimensions which can be interpreted as &#8220;Concern for Self&#8221;, &#8220;Concern for Client&#8221;, &#8220;Concern for Others&#8221;, and &#8220;Concern for Accounting Principles&#8221;. Results of cluster analysis established four primary classifications to the 38 auditor tactics. These are &#8220;Facilitating&#8221;, &#8220;Contextual&#8221;, &#8220;Forcing/asserting&#8221;, and &#8220;Appeal to authority&#8221;. Within these four classifications, twelve sub-categories were observed. These findings reinforce the complexities inherent in the resolution of an audit conflict, and suggest that auditors group together certain tactics for use as called for in the circumstances with which they are dealing.  This research contributes to theory within the fields of auditing and general negotiation because it has established that the two-dimensional model of concern that has formed the basis of much behavioural research is insufficient to describe an auditor&#8217;s responsibilities. There are four dimensions of concern. While some researchers have proposed a three-dimensional model of negotiation for auditors, the fourth dimension identified in this study is a contribution. This research expands current knowledge fundamental to the audit discipline by establishing the negotiation tactics used by auditors and their underlying multidimensionality, and thus has extended the knowledge of audit conflict management beyond that of strategy-level. Accordingly,this research is beneficial to practicing auditors and for the education of auditors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Confidential communications Australia Auditing</field><field name="subject">Disclosure of information Australia Auditing</field><field name="subject">Economics, Commerce - Business (0505)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/hollindale</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The authoritarian personality in the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Norris, Gareth</field><field name="description">This thesis began largely as an exploration into right-wing political ideology and its relationship to The Authoritarian Personality proposed by Adorno, Frenkel-Brunswick, Levinson and Sanford (1950). It had initially been envisaged that contemporary examples would manifest themselves within many neo-Fascist or &#8216;White Pride&#8217; style organisations and as an adage to their supposed historical underpinnings, would therefore be representative of modern day authoritarianism. As previously discovered by Eysenck and Coulter (1974) in their examination of British Fascists and Communists, the authoritarian syndrome is somewhat more complex to explain by way of reference to a number of radical semi-political organisations. Subsequently, the thesis was to take on a deeper and more philosophical direction as various parts of the literature were analysed and critiqued. And indeed to some extent the original proposal was abandoned in favour of a richer and more conceptual approach to our understanding of authoritarianism. This was discovered to be distinctly missing from the majority of the current literature in the field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Authoritarianism (Personality trait)</field><field name="subject">Psychology, Personality (0625)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/norris</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical analysis of the extent to which the personal civil rights recognised in the constitution of the Russian Federation are enjoyed under Russian law</field><field name="creator">Rapoport, Yuri</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the Russian Constitution 1993 and the legislation flowing from it against the background of the former (Soviet) constitutions and international human rights instruments at the beginning of Russia&#8217;s path towards democratization.Research for the thesis was conducted over a period of four years (1998 - 2002) during particular political and economic instability in the country following the financial crisis of 17 August 1998.A review was conducted of Russian laws that aim to protect, what are arguably the most fundamental rights of any democratic constitutional system - civil rights. Unlike political rights (which relate to the system of government), civil rights are the rights to liberty and equality granted to citizens of a country.The civil rights enumerated in this thesis are known as &#8216;natural&#8217; rights, and include the right to life; right to personal inviolability, right to privacy; right to dignity and good reputation; the freedom of information, movement, religion, language and nationality. These rights, are also referred to as &#8216;personal civil rights&#8217;, which is the term used in this thesis.The thesis presents a critical analysis of personal civil rights proclaimed in the Russian Constitution, demonstrating that although their articulation accords with international standards, there are obvious problems associated with economic and political factors that limit their enjoyment by Russian people.Most of the research for this thesis was conducted in Russia, providing a specific insight into the political, social and economic peculiarities (such as enduring totalitarian idiosyncrasies, and a prevailing context of corruption) the full extent of which is difficult to perceive from outside the country. Since, these peculiarities have a direct influence on the administration of justice in Russia, the thesis refers to local literature sources that contain an intimate knowledge of the effect of these factors on Russia&#8217;s current legal system.Chapter 1 of the thesis discusses the history and modern understanding of personal rights, as well as relevant parts of the current Russian Constitution, including how these differ from the previous constitutions. Subsequent chapters (2-9) discuss selected personal civil rights, which are particularly important in the context of Russian social, political, economic and legislative development; namely the rights to life and personal inviolability, privacy, dignity; and the freedom of information, movement, language nationality and religion,. These rights are at the core of any democratic constitutional system as they are essential in securing fundamental human freedoms.The Conclusion then summarizes the extent to which the personal civil rights proclaimed by the Russian Constitution are enjoyed by Russian people in light of Russia&#8217;s present political and economic reality. For most of the rights discussed, specific problems are identified and suggestions made as to what measures may be taken in order to overcome them.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Russia (Federation) Constitution</field><field name="subject">Russia (Federation) Constitutional law</field><field name="subject">Civil rights Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Human rights Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/rapoport3</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of the franchise relationship in Australia :a contractual analysis</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines whether the regulation of the franchise sector is effective in achieving two of the stated goals of the Franchising Code of Conduct. These two goals are redressing the imbalance of power in the relationship and increasing levels of certainty for participants in the sector. Based on the &#8216;new learning&#8217; in regulation, this dissertation takes an expansive approach to the concept of regulation. It considers how, in a &#8216;multi-layered system of governance&#8217;, the layers of regulation of the franchising sector contribute to these goals. The results of the analysis suggest that private, self-regulation through the layers of market and contract sets up a relationship where there is an imbalance of power in favour of a franchisor and uncertainty for a franchisee. The market interaction between the parties establishes these conditions, which are reinforced by the contract, in particular by the interaction of the standard form and relational qualities of the contract. A public layer of governance, direct intervention in the form of the Franchising Code of Conduct, relies largely on selfregulatory tools such as disclosure and is also ineffective in addressing the imbalance of power in the relationship and in increasing levels of certainty for franchisees. Because neither self-regulatory mechanisms nor legislative intervention achieves the stated goals of redressing imbalance of power and uncertainty in the franchise relationship, the analysis concludes that a reframing of regulation is necessary. The recommended revised regulatory program features collaborative, participative, democratic process to gather and assess good measurements that inform the identification of problems and the selection of tools appropriate to address those problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Franchises (Retail trade) Law and legislation Australia</field><field name="subject">Franchising (Retail trade)</field><field name="subject">Law (0398)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/spencer</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Class of Direct Search Methods for Nonlinear Integer Programming</field><field name="creator">Sugden, Stephen J</field><field name="description">This work extends recent research in the development of a number of direct search methods in nonlinear integer programming. The various algorithms use an extension of the well-known FORTRAN MINOS code of Murtagh and Saunders as a starting point. MINOS is capable of solving quite large problems in which the objective function is nonlinear and the constraints linear. The original MINOS code has been extended in various ways by Murtagh, Saunders and co-workers since the original 1978 landmark paper. Extensions have dealt with methods to handle both nonlinear constraints, most notably MINOS/AUGMENTED and integer requirements on a subset of the variables(MINTO). The starting point for the present thesis is the MINTO code of Murtagh. MINTO is a direct descendant of MINOS in that it extends the capabilities to general nonlinear constraints and integer restrictions. The overriding goal for the work described in this thesis is to obtain a good integer-feasible or near-integer-feasible solution to the general NLIP problem while trying to avoid or at least minimize the use of the ubiquitous branch-and-bound techniques. In general, we assume a small number of nonlinearities and a small number of integer variables.Some initial ideas motivating the present work are summarised in an invited paper presented by Murtagh at the 1989 CTAC (Computational Techniques and Applications) conference in Brisbane, Australia. The approach discussed there was to start a direct search procedure at the solution of the continuous relaxation of a nonlinear mixed-integer problem by first removing integer variables from the simplex basis, then adjusting integer-infeasible superbasic variables, and finally checking for local optimality by trial unit steps in the integers. This may be followed by a reoptimization with the latest point as the starting point, but integer variables held fixed. We describe ideas for the further development of Murtagh&#8217;s direct search method. Both the old and new approaches aim to attain an integer-feasible solution from an initially relaxed (continuous) solution. Techniques such as branch-and-bound or Scarf&#8217;s neighbourhood search [84] may then be used to obtain a locally optimal solution. The present range of direct search methods differs significantly to that described by Murtagh, both in heuristics used and major and minor steps of the procedures. Chapter 5 summarizes Murtagh&#8217;s original approach while Chapter 6 describes the new methods in detail.Afeature of the new approach is that some degree of user-interaction (MINTO/INTERACTIVE) has been provided, so that a skilled user can "drive" the solution towards optimality if this is desired. Alternatively the code can still be run in "automatic" mode, where one of five available direct search methods may be specified in the customary SPECS file. A selection of nonlinear integer programming problems taken from the literature has been solved and the results are presented here in the latter chapters. Further, anewcommunications network topology and allocation model devised by Berry and Sugden has been successfully solved by the direct search methods presented herein. The results are discussed in Chapter 14, where the approach is compared with the branch-and-bound heuristic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear integer programming</field><field name="subject">direct search method</field><field name="subject">Computer Science (0984)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/sugden</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criminal Profiling : a Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Process and Content</field><field name="creator">Petherick, Wayne</field><field name="description">This research examines the content and process involved in developing criminal profiles. To assess the material typically included in profiles and the way that the conclusions are developed, a qualitative analysis of the content of profiles was undertaken. This included, among other things, the characteristics offered, their prevalence, and the most common characteristics by profiling method. A further quantitative study was undertaken employing Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) which revealed three general themes in the advice given. These included Crime Scene, Internal Offender and Offender Characteristic facets, each of which was comprised of features suggestive of that facet. For example, the Crime Scene facet typically described offender actions and their interpretation at the physical location of the criminal event, such as staging and methods of control.The study employed a sample of 49 profilers reflective of the four main schools of thought; Criminal Investigative Analysis (CIA), Investigative Psychology (IP), Diagnostic Evaluations (DE) and Behavioural Evidence Analysis (BEA). CIA profiles were greatest in number with a sample size of 19. There were 14 BEA profiles and 8 each of DE and IP profiles. Together, there were in excess of 3000 individual variables ranging from age, sex and race to employment, geography, mental illness and risk.Results indicate that the vast majority of profilers employ either research or personal belief in forming their opinions, and that physical evidence is used the least in justifying a profiler&#8217;s opinion. However, when considering the individual methods, BEA placed the greatest reliance on physical evidence and its interpretation according with the forensic science philosophy of the method. CIA, the method used by the FBI, produced the most characteristics of the sample at 312 across 19 profiles, followed by BEA at 166 characteristics across 14 profiles. IP and DE profiles, with a sample size of eight each, had 90 and 61 characteristics respectively.Beyond these findings, the implication of the research will be discussed and some future direction for this research and the field in general will be provided. These areas include education, training, the scientific method and professionalisation. This thesis will also canvass the issue of whether profiling is an art or a science with particular reference to the research results and the existing literature that has bothered to address this issue.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Criminal behavior, Prediction of</field><field name="subject">Criminal investigation</field><field name="subject">Criminal methods Research Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Sociology, Criminology and Penology (0627)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/2</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Is the open organisations profile a valid and reliable measure of openness in organisations?</field><field name="creator">Stubbs, Lee</field><field name="description">This study is primarily about the Open Organisations Profile, a questionnaire developed in the United States by Professor Oscar Mink (1991) to assess openness in the workplace and thus assist in decisions on organisational change and development. The Open Organisations Profile was developed as an assessment tool of the Open Organisations theoretical model. The Open Organisations Model offers researchers a lens to assess an organisational system and the system&#8217;s ability to adapt to internal and external changes in its environment, while maintaining a sense of unity.While the Open Organisations Profile has been used extensively in Australia and the United States of America, limited research has examined its psychometric properties. This current set of studies aimed to examine the psychometric qualities of the instrument. The first study examined the reliabilities and factor structure of the Open Organisations Profile. Results indicated that the Open Organisations Profile displayed high internal consistency ranging from r = .80 to r = .95. Furthermore confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the theoretical three factor model of unity, internal responsiveness and external responsiveness.The second study assessed cultural differences and similarities between Australia and American using the profile. The findings suggested that significant differences existed between the countries and also between male and female values across the nine dimensions measured.The final study examined the relationships between the three higher order factors of openness and customer satisfaction and sales performance. The study found that the three factors of openness had a mediating effect on customer satisfaction and sales performance. The three studies showed the Open Organisation Profile offers researchers a reasonably reliable and valid instrument for assessing the openness of an organisation and its ability to adapt to internal and external changes in the organisation&#8217;s environment. Furthermore, the Open Organisations Profile could be used as guide to the areas that need to be addressed to help the organisation improve service delivery, customer satisfaction and financial return.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organization</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Organizational change</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management (0454)</field><field name="identifier">http://epublications.bond.edu.au/theses/15</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the nature of teacher knowledge needed and used in teaching statistics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctorate in Education (Ed.D.) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Timothy Angus</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the knowledge needed for teaching statistics through investigations at the primary (elementary) school level. Statistics has a relatively short history in the primary school curriculum, compared with mathematics. Recent research in statistics education has prompted a worldwide move away from the teaching of statistical skills, towards a broader underpinning of statistical thinking and reasoning. New Zealand&#8217;s nationally mandated curriculum reflects this move. Consequently, little is known about the types of knowledge needed to teach statistics effectively. Ideas from two contemporary areas of research, namely teacher content knowledge in relation to mathematics, and statistical thinking, are incorporated into a new framework, for exploring knowledge for teaching statistics. The study&#8217;s methodological approach is based on Popper&#8217;s philosophy of realism, and the associated logic of learning approach for classroom research. Four primary teachers (in their second year of teaching) planned and taught a sequence of four or five lessons, which were videotaped. Following each lesson, a stimulated recall interview, using an edited video of the lesson, was conducted with the teacher. The video and interview recordings were analysed in relation to the teacher knowledge and statistical thinking framework. The results provide detailed descriptions of the components of teacher knowledge in relation to statistical thinking that are needed and used in the classroom. Included in the results are profiles of each teacher&#8217;s knowledge. These profiles describe &#8216;missed opportunities&#8217;, which were defined as classroom incidents in which teacher knowledge was needed but not used, and consequently resulted in the teachers not taking advantage of chances to enhance students&#8217; learning. A number of significant themes were revealed, linked to knowledge for teaching statistics. The themes include: problems associated with teacher listening; the need for the teacher to be familiar with the data; students&#8217; difficulties with various components of the statistical investigation cycle; and understanding variation and the development of inference. The study concludes that for effective teaching of statistics through investigations, it is necessary for teachers to have knowledge in each of four categories as related to each component of statistical thinking. If any aspect of knowledge is not available or not used, teachers will not enhance, and could disadvantage, students&#8217; learning. Implications from the findings are considered for initial and on-going teacher education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">teacher knowledge</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Centruflow using semantic web technologies : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Giles, Jonathan Andrew</field><field name="description">Centruflow is an application that can be used to visualise structured data. It does this by drawing graphs, allowing for users to explore information relationships that may not be visible or easily understood otherwise. This helps users to gain a better understanding of their organisation and to communicate more effectively. In earlier versions of Centruflow, it was difficult to develop new functionality as it was built using a relatively unsupported and proprietary visualisation toolkit. In addition, there were major issues surrounding information currency and trust. Something had to be done, and this was a sub-project of this thesis. The main purpose of this thesis however was to research and develop a set of mathematical algorithms to infer implicit relationships in Centruflow data sources. Once these implicit relationships were found, we could make them explicit by showing them within Centruflow. To enable this, relationships were to be calculated based on providing users with the ability to 'tag' resources with metadata. We believed that by using this tagging metadata, Centruflow could offer users far more insight into their own data. Implementing this was not a straight-forward task, as it required a considerable amount of research and development to be undertaken to understand and appreciate technologies that could help us in our goal. Our focus was primarily on technologies and approaches common in the semantic web and 'Web 2.0' areas. By pursuing semantic web technologies, we ensured that Centruflow would be considerably more standards-compliant than it was previously. At the conclusion of our development period, Centruflow had been rather substantially 'retrofitted', with all proprietary technologies replaced with equivalent semantic web technologies. The result of this is that Centruflow is now positioned on the forefront of the semantic web wave, allowing for far more comprehensive and rapid visualisation of a far larger set of readily-available data than what was possible previously. Having implemented all necessary functionality, we validated our approach and were pleased to find that our improvements led to a considerably more intelligent and useful Centruflow application than was previously available. This functionality is now available as part of 'Centruflow 3.0', which will be publicly released in March 2008. Finally, we conclude this thesis with a discussion on the future work that should be undertaken to improve on the current release.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web technologies</field><field name="subject">CentruFlow</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalisation of Maori businesses in the creative industry sector : ko te rerenga o te toki a tu, he whare oranga : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Warriner, Virginia Carolyn Ann</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study how Maori businesses in the creative industries internationalise products and services. Sub-topics also investigated were the motivators and drivers, the types of support received and the challenges associated with exporting. The exporter, not yet exporter and non-exporter formed the three groups for this study. A mixed-method approach utilising a postal survey and indepth face-to-face interviews provided the data and results for the main findings. Ten themes emerged from the survey results and assisted with interpreting the interviews. An original koru framework was presented throughout the thesis to portray the findings as they evolved. Networking was identified as the preferred internationalisation approach in this study. Of the ten themes, the uniqueness of a product was the most important driver to exporting. Maori tikanga was also relevant as a Maori business driver and presented challenges when Maori principles were incorporated with everyday mainstream practices. Maori tikanga was the only theme specific to the Maori participants, whereas the other nine aspects are likely to pertain to non- Maori businesses in this sector. &#8220;Strong&#8221; and &#8220;weak&#8221; ties were integral to the participants&#8217; support infrastructure. However, government and its agencies were considered as being unhelpful to the smaller firm. Finance and exporting costs, followed by a lack of government assistance and incentives were the main export challenges for the participants. Another challenge for exporters were in finding suitable agents, contacts and distributors, whereas fluctuating exchange and interest rates were a problem for the not yet exporting group. A recommendation for Maori businesses is to continue creating unique products and to target international niche markets. Government needs to reassess their support policies and provide initiatives especially appropirate to micro and small businesses in the creative industries. There is also a need for government export agencies to better understand and market the uniqueness that Maori and their products offer to the international arena.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">creative industry</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1244</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two novel MYB transcriptional activators regulate floral and vegetative anthocyanin pigmentation patterns in Petunia : [a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand] EMBARGOED UNTIL 12 MARCH 2012</field><field name="creator">Albert, Nick William</field><field name="description">Mr Albert investigated the genetic mechanisms controlling complex floral and vegetative pigmentation patterns in Petunia. He discovered two new MYB transcription factors that control the timing and spatial location of anthocyanin pigment production in flowers and leaves, giving rise to specific colour patterns. He showed that complex pigmentation patterns are formed by tightly controlling the expression of genes required to synthesise anthocyanin pigments and involves proteins that both activate genes and repress them from being expressed. The interactions between distinct classes of transcription factors form an intricate network and hierarchy, allowing fine control of gene expression and strict control of pigment production. These findings will aid in the development of ornamental plants with new pigmentation patterns and also this research serves as a model for how plants control the expression of genes to produce health-promoting plant compounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigmentation patterns</field><field name="subject">Anthocyanin regulators</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological modernisation of industry : developing multi-disciplinary research in organization &amp; environment.</field><field name="creator">Orssato, Renato J.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops suitable approaches to conduct environment-related research in organisations, as well as systematic means for understanding the emergent phenomenon of ecological modernisation in industrialised societies. The study is organised in two distinct parts: While Part I deals with environment-related theories and practices in (and around) modern organisations, Part II situates such theories and practices in an analysis of the context of the European automobile industry. The research problem is defined through several stages. The research questions driving Part I are premised on the exploratory nature of the study, developed in an unfolding interplay between the review of the literature, the collection of secondary and (exploratory) primary data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. As the initial question is answered by reviewing the literature and interpreting the primary and secondary data, another question arises from the process, which then requires further research. Part II of the study departs from a proposition based on ecological modernisation theory, that pro-active environmental practices in corporations are part of a broader emergent sociological phenomenon, typical of modern industrialised societies. It analyses a specific socio-technical context that, hypothetically, is undergoing such process - that of the European automobile industry. Hence, the development of Part II aims at answering the following principal research question: Why is the European automobile industry undergoing ecological modernisation? Analytically, the concept of automobile field is proposed to establish a link between the product (automobile) and the context embedding its systems of production and consumption (field). The exploratory character of the study implied that the most adequate research procedures were of a qualitative nature. A combination of grounded theory and reflexive methodology is used to orientate the overall research process, which introduces a novel approach for the triangulation of qualitative data. Together, the chapters forming Part II of the thesis answer the principal research question. The fundamental technologies of the current technological regime of the automobile, as well as the economic and environmental implications of this regime are analysed. Then, an analysis of selected pilot programs to develop and commercialise electric vehicles, as well as schemes for the management of end-of-life vehicles in the Western European context is developed. Through the interplay between data collection and analysis, the thesis designs an analytical framework, built upon contingent factors, as well as circuits of political ecology, that foster or inhibit ecological modernisation in the automobile field. The study showed that the auto industry has developed incremental technological innovations and practices that resemble the pre-requisites for ecological modernisation. Radical innovations, however, are more likely to be initiated by outsiders. The concepts inherited from the past and reproduced in the present practice of car design explains such a situation as one that imposes a specific set of technologies on car manufacturing that require high levels of investment in systems of production. Such design paradigm not only imposes high break-even points for most car models; they also result in vehicles with extremely low environmental performance and entail serious limitations for increasing recycling rates of non-metallic parts. The characteristics of ecological modernisation in the European automobile industry are used to evaluate whether this phenomenon is conducive to sustainable industrial development. As an implication of this analysis, the concluding chapter presents suggestions for the enhancement of ecological modernisation theory. Fallibility is proposed as both a source of reflection about the appropriation of knowledge and a principle that can be used for the definition of eco-modernising strategies and actions. The acceptance of fallibility as an immanent characteristic of human action is critical for the approximation of the countervailing theories of ecological modernisation and risk society. Finally, if ecological modernisation is expected to facilitate sustainable industrial development, radical technological innovations may be necessary. Such radicalism in technology may need, however, an incremental institutional reform of modern societies. Together, radical technological innovations and incremental institutional reform constitute the concept of radical reformism, which is suggested for enhancement of the ecological modernisation theory, as well as for the development of its normative programmes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive industry.</field><field name="subject">Sustainability.</field><field name="subject">Industrial ecology.</field><field name="subject">Electric vehicles.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1006</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initialisation and Decentralised Control for Robotic Control</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Anh Duy</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

However, the implementation of evidence into clinical practice is a highly complex endeavour that has been said to occur in a 'black box&#8216;, defying easily reached explanations of how it happens in practice. The aim of this study is to explore the 'black box&#8216; of guideline implementation associated with primary health care nurses&#8216; use of a guideline that targets high health need populations in a region of New Zealand. The potential for improvement of cardiovascular health overall and the reduction of the marked disparities between M&#228;ori (indigenous people of New Zealand) and non-M&#228;ori drives the imperative to enact the recommendations of the Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. Primary health care nurses are well positioned at the frontline of healthcare to implement the guideline and an investigation of the realities of their practice as they do so will help to illuminate the contents of this particular 'black box&#8216;. The aim is achieved in two components by: 1. Exploring the complexities of primary health care nurses&#8216; use of the New Zealand Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. 2. Employing the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework to identify the enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in the primary health care setting. Method Both components of this study involve qualitative methods. The first component involves qualitative description utilising focus groups and interviews to explore the perceptions and experiences of a range of primary health care professionals involved in implementing the AMCVR guideline and thematic analysis of data. The second component utilises template analysis of the data, based on the Promoting Action of Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework. There are three elements of the PARiHS framework: Evidence, Context and Facilitation. This second component of the study is a systematic analysis of the enablers and barriers encountered by nurses as they implement the AMCVR guideline. Results The first component of the study generated four themes, which together have provided a rich portrait of the realities for nurses as they implemented the guideline. The four themes are self-managing client, everyday nursing practice, developing new relationships in the health team, and impact on health care delivery. The template analysis revealed that there were several enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in relation to Evidence and Context and that Facilitation was not occurring in a planned way. Conclusion Successful guideline implementation demands multidisciplinary, transformational practice development to create an effective workplace culture. Practice development is a powerful approach well suited to supporting primary health care nurses to maximise their practice-based knowledge and skills, and for them to contribute to the development of systems that will meet the information and communication requirements of successful guideline implementation. The imperative to improve cardiovascular health overall and specifically to address M&#228;ori health inequity mandates sustained effort and mobilisation of resources to ensure successful implementation of the AMCVR guideline.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative description.</field><field name="subject">Clinical practice guidelines.</field><field name="subject">Primary health care.</field><field name="subject">Implementation of evidence.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1074</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Privacy issues in health care and security of statistical databases</field><field name="creator">King, Tatiana</field><field name="description">Research Doctorate -

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD.

I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'&#8216;Because You Demanded It!': Participatory Culture and Superhero Comic Books</field><field name="creator">Taina Lloyd</field><field name="description">Comic books are one of the many popular cultural forms that attract, as part of their audience, a committed readership that engages in a participatory relationship as part of a shared interest in the text. In common with other media forms, this engagement expresses itself in a variety of ways, including interaction with other readers online and face-to-face at conventions, correspondence with producers, and the creation of textual products. Other features of the discourses and practices of this community may be more specific to the comic book readership. One of the most interesting of these is a participatory belief, widely expressed by readers, that they can influence the story content of the published comic book and that comic books are unique among other media forms in this. In this thesis, I investigate several aspects of this belief, in order to offer a more nuanced understanding of the participatory involvement that readers have in comic books, particularly the superhero comic books that dominate American comic book culture. First, I examine whether this participatory belief is supported by evidence from published comic books by undertaking a content analysis of the letter columns and story pages of comic books. Next, I explore the discourses of online comic book culture that relate to authorship and the boundaries of participation and show how the rules of textual engagement that are held by readers shape the interactions between readers and producers. Finally, I look for alternative participatory spaces that are available to comic book readers, finding these in a contested form of engagement with comic books, that of exploring the fictional universes of the text. This approach imagines the text as the representation of a non-actual world, to which the comic book is an incomplete window. Theorising this mode of engagement leads to a conceptualisation of participation that makes visible a participatory space that has been previously overlooked by academic fan studies, and that complicates the existing models of participatory culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">fan culture</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">comic books</field><field name="subject">fictional worlds</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199136</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bilingual Child-rearing in Linguistic Intermarriage: Negotiating Language, Power, and Identities between English-Speaking Fathers and Japanese-Speaking Mothers in Japan</field><field name="creator">Lachlan Jackson</field><field name="description">This is a qualitative sociolinguistic study that investigates the parental experiences of bilingual child-rearing for linguistically intermarried couples in Japan. In particular, it focuses on the role of native English-speaking fathers. Through the incorporation of questionnaire, logbook, and in-depth interview data, the study presents eight unique and richly-nuanced cases of language contact in the family domain. The thesis builds on influential works that have both questioned the ease with which children acquire two languages (Yamamoto, 2001b) and highlighted bilingual child-rearing as an emotionally draining and labour-intensive pursuit (Okita, 2002). In accordance with recent suggestions to more readily acknowledge the socio-political dimensions of bilingualism (e.g. Heller, 2007, p. 1; Myers-Scotton, 2006; Li Wei, 2008, p. 17), this study shows bilingual child-rearing to be an innately political phenomenon. The study supports the supposition that the individual circumstances of linguistically intermarried couples rarely align neatly with the prescriptive advice found in much of the popular literature on how to raise children in two (or more) languages (Piller, 2001b). In particular, abstractions of power and discursively constructed identities are shown to structure both the specific language choices and the broader parental practices of the couples in this study. For linguistically intermarried couples, bilingual child-rearing is shown to be a fluid process of negotiation, whereby language choices and decisions about transmission strategies are tied to social positioning of both self and other. Drawing from a broader literature pertaining to the social psychology of parenting, this thesis also proposes a model to analyse the ecological context of bilingual child-rearing. The linguistic behaviours of the parents, as well as their decisions concerning family language planning are shown to emerge from each family&#8217;s unique and fluctuating set of social circumstances. These include, but are not limited to, the quality of the spousal relationship, the family&#8217;s economic resources, (shifting) cultural affiliations of all family members, future plans, minority language contact opportunities, the medium of instruction at the child&#8217;s school, the needs and wishes of extended family members, as well as the agency of the child.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilingualism</field><field name="subject">Child-rearing</field><field name="subject">Linguistic Intermarriage</field><field name="subject">Power</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Stated Organizational Values in Times of Change and Crisis</field><field name="creator">Stewart Arnold</field><field name="description">Weick (2006) calls for researchers to investigate how employees &#8216;hold it together&#8217; during periods when organizational routine and order are challenged. This thesis focuses on employee experiences during two types of organizational upheaval: periods of planned, large-scale organizational change and periods of organizational crisis triggered by external events. In both conditions, employees can react negatively. This leads to failure to cope with the current situation and with future situations that pose similar threats and challenges. On the other hand, if employees can make sense of a threatening, challenging situation, the outcomes are more positive for them as individuals and for the organization as a whole. Weick&#8217;s (1988) concept of sensemaking is used as a guiding framework for investigating the experiences, attitudes, and actions reported by employees in times of organizational change and crisis. The general assertion of the thesis is that the espoused and enacted values of an organization provide sensemaking cues to employees in difficult times. More specifically, the role of stated organizational values is examined. Organizational values are often stated as a set of principles that provide guidance for employees, particularly as part of a managing-by-values approach. The context for the research program is the healthcare industry, because values are very important for healthcare employees. Moreover, healthcare organizations must continue to function optimally during challenging conditions. Three research studies are reported. Study 1 was conducted in an Australian public hospital that was undergoing large-scale change. Thirty-five employees from a range of occupations were interviewed midway through the five-year period of change. Thematic analysis of their interviews revealed that employees mostly reported negative experiences of the change program. Furthermore, employees made sense of the change program by focusing on specific cues in their situation. One such cue was the organization&#8217;s strongly promoted set of &#8216;core values&#8217;. The stated values were seen to be a visible symbol of the hospital&#8217;s principles, but there were negative perceptions about how well these principles were enacted. Study 2 was conducted in a public hospital in Singapore exposed to a crisis situation due to the SARS virus in 2003. Thirty-one employees from a range of occupations were interviewed four months after the outbreak had ended. Twenty of these participants returned for a second interview, one week after the first interview. A card sort procedure and thematic analysis of the interview data were used to investigate employees&#8217; experiences of the crisis. Results revealed that employees made sense of the crisis through identification with their profession and their organization. They also perceived that the hospital&#8217;s actions during the crisis were consistent with its written set of organizational values. In addition, employees identified a number of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) that they had shown during the crisis. Study 3 was conducted at three hospitals in Singapore. A pilot study involved 24 employees from a public hospital. They engaged in a focus group discussion about professionalism and they refined a set of hospital-specific employee behaviors that could potentially be classified as OCBs. The main study involved survey completion by a stratified sample of employees from another public hospital (n= 214) and from a private hospital (n=184). All respondents were invited to complete a second survey (measuring related variables) three weeks after the first survey. Analysis of 301 usable survey responses revealed findings that contribute to different literatures. Firstly, asking respondents to rate OCBs according to whether they were voluntary, unrewarded, and beneficial to the organization, revealed that many OCB items used in previous research were not perceived as being &#8216;true OCBs&#8217; by the survey respondents. Furthermore, despite the use of many possible OCB dimensions, the true OCB items were factor analyzed into just two factors. One factor reflected OCBOs, which are behaviors directed towards the organization as a whole, while the other factor reflected OCBIs, which are behaviors directed towards other individuals. A second contribution is the suggestion that employees&#8217; sense of &#8216;professionalism&#8217; is a single construct. Survey respondents did not distinguish between professional identification and professional commitment in the same way as organizational identification and commitment were differentiated. Professionalism was weakly related to tendency to engage in OCBOs and more strongly related to tendency to engage in OCBIs. Finally, the main contribution to the values literature is the development of the concept of &#8216;organizational values integrity&#8217; (OVI). This is conceptualized as the perceived alignment between organizational actions and organizational words, especially those words espoused in values statements. Structural equation modeling revealed that OVI influenced organizational identification and organizational commitment, which both mediated the impact of OVI on OCBOs. Furthermore, OVI had a direct impact on OCBOs. Overall, this thesis highlights employee perceptions that the organization acts in ways that are aligned to its stated values as important influences on employee attitudes and OCBs, particularly in difficult times.

These reasons come in two forms &#8211; limitations internal to the basic functioning of natural rights as such and limitations arising from rights-based considerations external to the property right. In terms of internal constraints, all natural rights conform to a variety of conditions delimiting the extent and strength of their application. Such conditions include, inter alia, requirements for consistency, universalisability and non-worsening. Like all rights, natural property rights must fulfil these conditions &#8211; but such rights require substantial limitations in order to legitimate their capacity to unilaterally impose new duties on others. Consideration of these conditions is, I argue, not sufficient to rule out natural intellectual property rights &#8211; but such conditions decisively limit the extent of those rights. By focusing upon the most general and deep-seated mechanisms of natural rights thought, this argument aims to be applicable to all natural rights theories. I argue natural rights theories have good reasons to accept one, if not both, of two conditions in particular: robust universalisability and self-ownership. As strong intellectual property rights violate both conditions, I conclude such rights cannot be justified by any recognisable natural rights theory. Turning to external considerations, I argue all individuals have a right to intellectual liberty &#8211; the right to inform their actions by learning about the world. This is a negative right: it grants freedom from interference in apprehending, investigating and thinking about the world, and in subsequently acting upon what has been learned. I argue this right is grounded in all Enlightenment views of human freedom and flourishing; it is supported by classical liberal State of Nature perspectives, and arises out of respect for human independence, self-governance, self-legislation, self-creation, autonomy and individuality. Acceptance of this right has profound consequences for the strength and scope of intellectual property regimes. I describe the extent we can find this right already operative &#8211; albeit in schematic and inchoate form &#8211; in contemporary intellectual property law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural rights</field><field name="subject">intellectual property</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">legal rights</field><field name="subject">John Locke</field><field name="subject">public domain</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201716</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Defining Sets in Latin Squares and two Intersection Problems, one for Latin Squares and one for Steiner Triple Systems</field><field name="creator">Thomas Mccourt</field><field name="description">Consider distinct latin squares, L and M, of order n. Then the pair (T1, T2) where T1 = L \M and T2 = M \ L is called a latin bitrade. Furthermore T1 and T2 are referred to as latin trades, in which T2 is said to be a disjoint mate of T1 (and vice versa). Dr&#225;pal (1991) showed that, under certain conditions, a partition of an equilateral triangle of side length n, where n is some integer, into smaller, integer length sided equilateral triangles gives rise to a latin trade within the latin square based on the addition table for the integers modulo n. A partial latin square P of order n is said to be completable if there exists a latin square L of order n such that P &#8838; L. If there is only one such possible latin square, L, of order n then P is said to be uniquely completable and P is called a defining set of L. Furthermore, if C is a uniquely completable partial latin square such that no proper subset of C is uniquely completable, C is said to be a critical set or a minimal defining set. These concepts, namely latin trades and defining sets in latin squares, are intimately connected by the following observation. If L is a latin square and D &#8838; L is a defining set, then D intersects all latin bitrades for which one mate is contained in L. In Part I of this thesis Dr&#180;apal&#8217;s result is applied to investigate the structure of certain defining sets in latin squares. The results that are obtained are interesting in themselves; furthermore, the geometric approach to the problem yields additional appealing results. These geometric results are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6. They pertain to partitioning regions (polygons in R2 that satisfy certain obvious conditions) into equilateral, integer length sided, triangles, such that no point, in the region, is a corner of more than three distinct triangles. In Chapter 2 one of the main two theorems on defining sets is established, as is a method for using the above geometric results to prove the nonexistence of certain types of defining sets. In Part II of this thesis, intersection problems, for latin squares and Steiner triple systems, are considered. The seminal works, for problems of these types, are due to Lindner and Rosa (1975) and Fu (1980). A natural progression, from the established literature, for intersection problems between elements in a pair of latin squares or Steiner triple systems is to problems in which the intersection is composed of a number of disjoint configurations (isomorphic copies of some specified partial triple system). In this thesis solutions to two intersection problems for disjoint configurations are detailed. An m-flower, (F,F), is a partial triple system/configuration, such that: F = {{x, yi, zi} | {yi, zi} &#8745; {yj , zj} = &#8709;, for 0 &#8804; i, j &#8804; m &#8722; 1, i 6= j}; and F = UX&#8712;FX. The first such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k and m &#8805; 2 such that a pair of latin squares of order n exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint m-flowers. The necessary terminology, constructions, lemmas and proof for this result are contained in Chapters 7, 8 and 9. The second such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k such that a pair of Steiner triple systems of order u exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint 2-flowers. This result relies on the solution to the latin square problem and an additional result from Chapter 9. The further constructions and lemmas used to prove this result are detailed in Chapter 10.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">latin trade</field><field name="subject">latin bitrade</field><field name="subject">triangulation</field><field name="subject">defining set</field><field name="subject">critical set</field><field name="subject">partial triple system</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple system</field><field name="subject">intersection problem</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christology in Crisis: An Assessment and Response</field><field name="creator">Dean Smith</field><field name="description">The tradition of classical Christology, understood in a MacIntyrean sense as an historically extended and socially embodied argument, is facing an epistemological crisis due to the fact that, at each stage in its complex development, it has failed to resolve the problems arising out of the articulation of the classical interpretation of the Incarnation. This failure on the part of the tradition is due to the unsatisfactory and intractable metaphysical dualism at its heart. This dualism, highlighted in each successive attempt to explain the union of the divine and human natures in Christ, is to be understood as a symptom of a more fundamental God-world dualism, entailed by the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, and informing the traditional Christian conceptual scheme. Failure to recognise and address the God-world problematic has led to one-sided Christological solutions that reflect and reinforce this original and most basic dualism. An alternative view of God is needed to inform Christology if the problematic dualism at the heart of the classical model is to be overcome and the epistemological crisis resolved. Pan(en)theism is such an alternative model of God that offers resources for a non-dualistic Christopraxis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">22 Philosophy and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">Christology, classical Christology, Alasdair MacIntyre, Karl Rahner, panentheism, dualism, epistemological crisis, creation ex nihilo, incommensurability, tradition.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203098</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between hypothalamic gene expression and the resumption of ovulation in postpartum beef cows</field><field name="creator">Ainu Husna M S Suhaimi</field><field name="description">The aim in this thesis was to gain an understanding of changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus of postpartum beef cows during the period of transition from suppressed ovarian follicular growth to increased follicular growth, and the resumption of ovulation. Beef cows tend to have an extended period of anoestrus after calving. This trait is particularly pronounced in tropically-adapted Zebu breeds. In addition to a genetic component, the postpartum anoestrous period can be influenced by age, body condition, the nutrient requirement of lactation, suckling stimulus, and maternal bonding. An extended postpartum anoestrous period is particularly evident in primiparous beef cows. This is understandable given that primiparous cows have yet to reach their mature body size which means there is a requirement to maintain maternal tissue growth whilst at the same time directing nutrients for milk production. Weaning removes maternal bonding, the suckling stimulus and nutrient requirement of milk production and, provided that nutrient supply and body condition are appropriate, primiparous cows show increased ovarian activity and resume ovulation after weaning. In the present thesis, groups of primiparous Zebu cows were weaned to promote increased ovarian follicular growth and hypothalamic gene expression was compared for weaned cows and contemporary cows that continued to lactate. Candidate genes were studied using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and a gene expression microarray was used to discover new genes and gene networks. Gene expression was examined in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area (sub-region H1) and posterior ventral hypothalamus (sub-region H2). The demarcation between H1 and H2 was a vertical line from the mid-point of the median eminence-pituitary stalk to the thalamus. Candidate genes studied by qRT-PCR included, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GNRH1), kisspeptin (KISS1), neuropeptide Y (NPY), oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and leptin receptor (LEPR). Marked regional expression was demonstrated for these genes. The expression of GNRH1 was greatest in the anterior hypothalamic region (sub-region H1) whilst the expression of KISS1 was greatest in the ventral posterior hypothalamic region (sub-region H2). Relative expression of LEPR, ESR1 and NPY was greater in H2 than H1. The regional gene expression patterns for GNRH1, KISS1, LEPR, ESR1 and NPY in the hypothalamus of cows were consistent with regional expression reported for other species. Weaning was associated with a decrease in the expression of LEPR, ESR1 and NPY. With regard to ovarian phenotype, there was a greater LEPR expression associated with ovarian phenotype 1 (OP1, follicles to 5mm) compared with ovarian phenotype 2 (OP2, follicles to 10mm) and ovarian phenotype 3 (OP3, recently ovulated) in sub-region H1. Relative expressions for ESR1, LEPR and NPY were highly correlated, particularly in sub-region H2. The evaluation of gene expression by microarray for cows with different ovarian phenotypes provided evidence of interactions between hormonal regulation and cell-cell signalling within the hypothalamus. Genes that were differentially expressed for different ovarian phenotypes were associated with reproduction, energy balance, the immune system and stress. Other genes that showed differential expression were involved with cell adhesion, synaptic transmission, ion signalling and neuronal development. The latter findings were interpreted to suggest that neuronal and glial cell plasticity is a feature of changes in reproductive functions of the hypothalamus. The evaluation of gene expression by microarray for weaned and suckled cows, irrespective of ovarian phenotype, identified differentially expressed genes associated with energy balance, fluid homeostasis, milk synthesis, stress, and oestrogen signalling. With regard the latter, thirty seven genes involved in oestrogen signalling through ESR1, or in other ways associated with oestrogen, were found to be differentially expressed between weaned and lactating cows. ESR1 occupied the central position of a primary gene network based on the present study. Six differentially expressed genes were shown by gene network analysis to be centred in nodes interacting closely with ESR1. Phospholipase-C-gamma (PLCG2), vitronectin (VTN) and endopin 1 (SERPINA3) are three genes associated with hypothalamic plasticity and neurotransmission that were differentially expressed between cows with OP1 and OP2, indicating a possible role in the shift to increased ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. The findings for ESR1 were consistent with the major role of oestrogen in female reproduction and in particular the known actions of oestrogen in regulating the hypothalamus during reproductive transition phases in females associated with puberty, seasonality and postpartum. Gonadotrophin inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is derived from Neuropeptide VF precursor (NPVF), which is encoded by NPVF gene transcripts. NPVF had reduced expression in cows that had ovulated (OP3) compared with OP1 and OP2. GnIH inhibits gonadotrophin secretion by directly acting on GnRH neurons as well as modulating the suppressive effects of oestrogen negative feedback. In addition, GnIH has been shown to play a role in seasonal regulation of reproduction in birds. The lesser expression of NPVF in cows that had resumed ovulation, particularly evident in sub-region H2, provides initial evidence that GnIH has an important role in maintaining the suppressive effects on reproduction during postpartum anoestrus in cattle. In summary, the studies in this thesis have identified hypothalamic genes and gene networks that potentially are important in the control of reproductive function in the postpartum cow. The thesis has also established that the postpartum cow can be used as an experimental model for fundamental studies that generate new knowledge on the reproductive biology of the postpartum period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postpartum anoestrus</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">hypothalamus</field><field name="subject">quantitative RT-PCR</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203107</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The American connection and Australian policy in Southeast Asia, 1945-1965</field><field name="creator">Sah Hadiyatan Ismail</field><field name="description">In 1942 Curtin officially turned Australia to the United States for support and regarded the United States as Australia&#8217;s ally in World War II.

Australia believed that it had &#8216;a special relationship&#8217; with the United States through the formation of these treaties and regarded these treaties, especially ANZUS, as the cornerstone of Australia&#8217;s defence. The United States, however, did not give any special significance to these treaties and continued to treat Australia as it treated other friendly countries. The main focus of this thesis is on how the American-Australian alliance forged through ANZUS and SEATO influenced Australian foreign policy regarding Southeast Asia, especially in relation to issues such as the West New Guinea sovereignty problem, the defence of Malaya, Konfrontasi and Vietnam. The central argument is to examine how the American connection affected Australian foreign policy in Southeast Asia. As both countries saw the importance of this area to their strategic and defence interest and were heavily involved in the defence of Southeast Asia after World War II, this thesis will analyse on how the Australians reacted to and interacted with the Americans. This thesis reveals that Australia&#8217;s suggestions, plans, views and opinions regarding events in Southeast Asia were constantly rejected by the Americans. This rejection however, did not deter the Australian government from continuously pursuing a policy that would impress the United States. Australia tried hard to be a &#8216;good buddy&#8217; to the Americans and became ever more subservient and submissive to American wishes. Although there were cases where Australia tried to pursue a policy that differed from the Americans, as in West New Guinea prior to 1959 and in the defence of Malaya, these Australian efforts could not sustain pressure from other actors and were doomed to failure without the support of the Americans. The failure to pursue independent policies was influenced by the increasingly dependent attitude of the Australian government towards the Americans and the fear that Australia would be left alone to defend itself. As Britain, Australia&#8217;s traditional ally&#8217;s influence in Southeast Asia was in decline,Australia perceived that it did not have other choices but to cling ever more tightly and submissively to the Americans for its own survival.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANZUS</field><field name="subject">SEATO</field><field name="subject">Australian foreign policy</field><field name="subject">Konfrontasi</field><field name="subject">alliance</field><field name="subject">United States foreign policy</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Southeast Asia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203543</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Union Strategy in Developing Countries: Lessons from Indonesian Enterprise Unions in the Services Sector</field><field name="creator">Aryana Satrya</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an analysis of the role and effectiveness of unions in selecting their strategy to meet the needs of their members in developing countries &#8211; in this case Indonesia after the late Soeharto regime stepped down in 1998. In particular, the focus of the research is to understand how the selection of particular union strategies might influence union effectiveness in the context of developing economies. The research involves a major empirical study of unions based on a comprehensive analytical framework. The study finds its relevance in providing both theoretical and practical strategies for unions operating in a constraining political environment and in an era where the power of unions in general has been sharply diminishing. Based on various theoretical models of union strategy, the thesis develops a measure that explores union strategy from the initial stage of strategy creation - namely the establishment of union aims - through the process of strategy-development, resulting in the forms of union methods and tactics that are used in day-to-day union operations. The thesis also develops a model of organisational effectiveness that enables a comprehensive picture of union effectiveness. The model was operationalised by the use of a survey questionnaire. The fieldwork was conducted between the period of January to June 2005 in enterprise unions in the services sector. Responses from 100 unions were analysed using multiple regression techniques. The results yielded five independent variables that contributed significantly to the prediction of union effectiveness. Those variables included partnership between unions and management, the use of innovation and training for empowering union members, setting up specific departments for dealing with industrial and organisational issues, and attempts to gain external support for strengthening unions&#8217; negotiations with management. Altogether, these factors explained 65% of the variability in union effectiveness. Some important findings emerged from subsequent case studies that involved seven eligible unions. The most effective unions placed a strong emphasis on political goals by participating in the process of policy formulation both at the workplace and beyond the enterprise boundary. They employed both arbitration practices and relationships with political institutions to support their collective bargaining. A combination of tactical approaches including industrial action, provision of member services and use of information and communications technologies were used together with contemporary campaign themes such as workplace improvement and productivity. The most effective unions faced environments that discouraged workers from participating, including the existence of competitive wages, employee involvement plans, and covert anti-union strategies from companies. The results suggest that &#8220;consultancy&#8221; unionism is the dominant approach adopted by Indonesian unions in the services sector. This approach involves servicing members and developing only limited engagement with employers. Turning &#8220;consultancy&#8221; unionism into &#8220;partnership&#8221; unionism appears to be the most promising, approach to increased union effectiveness in the Indonesian context. To implement such a strategy, Indonesian unions have to strengthen their commitment to providing resources for organising, to boost participation among their members, and subsequently to construct a partnership based on &#8220;the collective power of workers&#8221;. The research has implications for unions, employers, and the state. For unions, the advantage of committing to establish a culture of organising builds a foundation for delivering a multi-tactical approach. However, in light of the limited strength of union power, that objective may best be achieved through partnership with employers. The findings concerning partnership strategies provide strong support for the government&#8217;s efforts at establishing industrial peace.

This thesis describes some of the fundamental pre-clinical in vitro experiments undertaken in preparation for this trial so as to maximise the potential of this vaccine to induce myeloma-specific immune responses. These experiments involved determining the parameters for optimal activation of the CMRF-56 immunoselected cell preparation and exploring the potential of novel myeloma peptide antigens to induce anti-myeloma cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. CMRF-56 immunoselected cell preparations, containing predominately myeloid BDC, monocytes and B cells, were prepared from both healthy donors and myeloma patients. Activation of this preparation with granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was found to increase co-stimulatory molecule expression by and survival of BDC, improve peptide- and lysate-specific CTL induction, and, in combination with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), improve chemokine-specific migration of BDC. Following optimisation of in vitro CTL generation protocols, GM-CSF activated CMRF-56 immunoselected cells were examined for their ability to induce myeloma-specific immunity. Using lysate from myeloma cell line U266 as an antigen source, a polyclonal T cell pool was generated within which peptide specific CTL recognising myeloma antigens Muc1, HM1.24/BST2, DKK-1 and CT-7/MAGE-C1 could be identified. Furthermore, GM-CSF activated CMRF-56 immunoselected cells pulsed with HLA-A*201 restricted peptides derived from Muc1, HM1.24/BST2 and CT-7/MAGE-C1 could induce CTL capable of lysing both peptide- and myeloma cell line targets in both healthy donors and myeloma patients. These results provide the first evidence of immunogenic HLA-A*201 restricted epitopes of novel myeloma antigen CT-7/MAGE-C1. The data collected in this study supports the application of GM-CSF activated CMRF-56 immunoselected cells loaded with defined myeloma peptide antigens for the therapeutic vaccination of MM patients with minimal residual disease.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Dendritic Cell</field><field name="subject">Immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">Cytotoxic T Cell</field><field name="subject">Multiple Myeloma</field><field name="subject">tumour antigen</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204556</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Interpretation of Floatability Using the Bubble Load</field><field name="creator">Simon David Dewhurst Welsby</field><field name="description">Flotation models describe the separability of mineral particles using a loosely defined term known as floatability or probability of collection, a response of particles in the pulp zone of a flotation vessel, unrelated to events in the froth phase. The Bubble Load measurement samples the particles that have attached to bubbles in the pulp zone and, thus, should give an indication of floatability. This thesis investigates the role of floatability in flotation models, and assesses the Bubble Load measurement as a direct estimate of floatability. Towards these ends, continuous pilot-scale flotation tests were carried out in which collector addition rate was varied. This allowed the floatability of mineral particles to be back-calculated on a size-by-liberation basis and be compared to the measured Bubble Load. Contrary to expectations it was found that, with increasing collector addition rate, the &#8220;floatability&#8221; of a majority of galena particle classes did not increase after 5 mg/kg of collector, while the measured Bubble Load actually decreased. This was found to be due to the stability of the froth increasing with collector addition rate, causing more galena to reach the concentrate, and less to drop-back to the pulp phase to be reattached. Conversely, there were other particle classes (such as sphalerite and coarse galena) where the expected trends were found, namely increasing floatability and Bubble Load with collector addition rate. These results indicate a high level of interdependence between the pulp and froth zones of the studied flotation cell through the flow of material between them (internal reflux). In the case of galena, the flow of material returning via drop-back from the froth had a greater impact on the Bubble Load than the galena in the feed made sufficiently hydrophobic to attach to bubbles. This means that, for the system studied here, the Bubble Load measurement does not provide a direct estimate of mineral particle floatability, defined as a sole consequence of pulp phase events. Moreover, for the current case, it appears that this definition of floatability is not sufficient to capture the interactions between the pulp and the froth. It is recommended that pulp and froth zone flotation models be developed in concert, recognising the interaction between the two zones, and that flotation models be formulated with due allowance for the material transport paths within a flotation vessel. It should be recognised that &#8220;floatability&#8221; is an aid for the imagination; a term for a process, rather than a particle &#8220;property&#8221; to be measured. An extension of the kinetic chemical reaction analogue, incorporating flotation sub-processes, is suggested/revived, to give some phenomenological basis to kinetic flotation models.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flotation Modelling</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">floatability</field><field name="subject">Bubble Load</field><field name="subject">Liberation</field><field name="subject">collector</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The story of alpha-conotoxins, Vc1.1 and RgIA, on their journey to becoming therapeutics</field><field name="creator">Reena Halai</field><field name="description">Abstract The broad aim of this thesis is to structurally and functionally explore two &#945;-conotoxins, from venomous sea snails, Vc1.1 and RgIA, in the hope of improving their journey to becoming analgesic therapeutics (introduction to conotoxins in Chapter 1). Vc1.1 is a two-disulfide peptide that is of interest as a potential therapeutic for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Despite investigations, limited structure-activity relationships have been conducted on this &#945;-conotoxin. Consequently there is restricted insight into the interaction of this peptide with one of its analgesic targets, the &#945;9&#945;10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Late in this PhD project, the GABAB receptor was implicated as the possible target for conotoxins in neuropathic pain relief. However, there is still debate in the literature with regard to the true target of Vc1.1 and the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR is still believed to be the target by some groups. This thesis predominantly focuses on the &#945;9&#945;10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Chapter 4 of this thesis presents an extensive series of mutational studies in which all residues except the conserved cysteines were mutated separately to Ala, Asp or Lys (materials and methods described in Chapter 3) and examined using NMR spectroscopy (theory of NMR presented in Chapter 2), to determine the effects of the mutations on the structure of Vc1.1. The structural fold was found to be preserved in all peptides except where Pro was substituted. Chapter 5 explores the effect of these mutations on the blocking of acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked membrane currents at the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR. Electrophysiological studies showed that the key residues for Vc1.1&#8217;s activity are Asp5-Arg7 and Asp11-Ile15, as changes at these positions resulted in the loss of activity at the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR. Interestingly, the S4K and N9A analogs were more potent than Vc1.1 itself. Hence, Chapter 6 describes a second generation of mutants that was synthesized, namely N9G, N9I, N9L, S4R and S4K+N9A, all of which were more potent than Vc1.1 at both the rat &#945;9&#945;10 and the human &#945;9/rat &#945;10 hybrid receptor, providing a mechanistic insight into the key residues involved in eliciting the biological function of Vc1.1. The most potent analogs were also tested at the &#945;3&#946;2, &#945;3&#946;4 and &#945;7 nAChR subtypes to determine their selectivity. All mutants tested were most selective for the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR. These findings provide valuable insight into the interaction of Vc1.1 with the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR subtype and will help in the further development of Vc1.1 or its analogs as drugs. However, despite peptides exhibiting high degrees of potency and selectivity, such as Vc1.1 and RgIA, they are potentially hindered in their development as drugs due to their stability and bioavailability limitations, leading to invasive delivery techniques. Chapter 7 presents a range of cyclic RgIA analogs, tested at their targets the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR and the GABAB receptor, that retain their activity and increase their stability in human serum relative to non-cyclic RgIA. NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the structure of the non-cyclic peptide and the cyclic peptide to confirm similarities in the global fold of the peptide. Structural perturbations and reduced activities were observed for cyclic RgIA analogs cyclized via linkers composed of three and four residues. Analogs with five, six and seven residues showed no structural perturbations, but differences in their activities at the different receptors. Because cRgIA-6 showed high potency for the GABAB receptor and lower potency for the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR, this study has identified a GABAB selective peptide. Additionally, because the cRgIA-7 showed high potency for the &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR and low potency for the GABAB receptor, a &#945;9&#945;10 nAChR selective analog has also been identified. With improvements in these peptides against enzymatic attack, they show great potential on their path to becoming orally available analgesics as they may be able to withstand enzymatic conditions in the stomach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">conotoxins, structure-activity, nAChR, cyclization, GABAB receptor, mutagenesis, NMR</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204887</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Large-scale metabolic flux analysis for mammalian cells: a systematic progression from model conception to model reduction to experimental design</field><field name="creator">Lake-ee Quek</field><field name="description">Recombinant protein production by mammalian cells is a core component of today&#8217;s multi-billion dollar biopharmaceutical industry. Transcriptome and proteome technologies have been used to probe for cellular components that correlate with higher cell-specific productivity, but have yet to yield results that can be translated into practical metabolic engineering strategies. The recognition of cellular complexity has led to an increasing adoption of systems biology, a holistic investigation approach that aims to bring together different omics technologies and to analyze the resulting datasets under a unifying context. Fluxomics is chosen as the platform context to investigate cell metabolism because it captures the integrated effects of gene expression, enzyme activity, metabolite availability and regulation, thereby providing a global picture of the cell&#8217;s metabolic phenotype. At present, the routine quantification of cell metabolism revolves around very basic cellular parameters: growth, substrate utilization and product formation. For a systems approach, however, just measuring gross metabolic features is insufficient; we are compelled to perform high-resolution, large-scale fluxomics in order to match the scale of other omics datasets. The challenges of performing large-scale fluxomics come from two opposing fronts. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is the estimation of intracellular fluxes from experimental data using a stoichiometric model, a process very much susceptible to modelling biases. The in silico challenge is to construct the most comprehensive model to represent the metabolism of a specific cell, while the in vivo challenge is to resolve as many fluxes as possible using experimental measurements or constraints. A compromise needs to be established between maximizing the resolution of the MFA model and working within technical limitations of the flux experiment. Conventional MFA models assembled from textbook pathways have been available for animal cell culture for the past 15 years. A state-of-the-art model was developed and used to analyse continuous hybridoma culture and batch CHO cell culture data (Chapter 3). Reasonable metabolic assumptions combined with constraint based analysis exploiting irreversibility constraints enabled the resolution of most fluxes in central carbon metabolism. However, while the results appear consistent, there is insufficient information in conventional measurement of uptake, secretion and growth data to assess the completeness of the model and validity of all assumptions. 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C MFA) can potentially resolve fluxes in the central carbon metabolism using flux constraints generated from 13C enrichment patterns of metabolites, but the multitude of substrate uptakes (glucose and amino acids) seen in mammalian cells, in addition to the lack of 13C enrichment data from proteinogenic amino acids, makes it very difficult to anticipate how a labelling experiment should be carried out. The challenges above have led to the development of a systematic workflow to perform large-scale MFA for mammalian cells. A genome-scale model (GeMs), an accurate compilation of gene-protein-reaction-metabolite associations, is the starting basis to perform whole-cell fluxomics. A semi-automated method was developed in order to rapidly extract a prototype of GeM from KEGG and UniProtKB databases (Chapter 4). Core metabolic pathways in the mouse GeM are mostly complete, suggesting that these databases are comprehensive and sufficient. The rapid prototyping system takes advantage of this, making long term maintenance of an accurate and up-to-date GeM by an individual possible. A large number of under-determined pathways in the mouse GeM cannot be resolved by 13C MFA because they do not produce any distinctive 13C enrichment patterns among the carbon metabolites. This has led to the development of SLIPs (short linearly independent pathways) for visualizing these under-determined metabolic pathways contained in large-scale GeMs (Chapter 5). Certain SLIPs are subsequently removed based on careful consideration of their pathway functions and the implications of their removal. A majority of SLIPs have a cyclic configuration, sharing similar redox or energy co-metabolites; very few represent true conversion of substrates to products. Of the 266 under-determined SLIPs generated from the mouse GeM, only 27 SLIPs were incorporated into the final working model under the criterion that they are significant pathways and are potentially resolvable by tracer experiments. Most of these SLIPs are degradation pathways of essential amino acids and inter-conversion of non-essential amino acids (Chapter 8). In parallel, OpenFLUX was developed to perform large-scale isotopic 13C MFA (Chapter 6). This software was built to accept multiple labelled substrates, and no restriction has been placed on the model type or enrichment data. These are necessary features to support large-scale flux analysis for mammalian cells. This was followed by the development of a design strategy that uses analytical gradients of isotopomer measurements to predict resolvability of free fluxes, from which the effectiveness of various 13C experimental scenarios using different combinations of input substrates and isotopomer measurements can be evaluated (Chapter 7). Hypothetical and experimental results have confirmed the predictions that, when glucose and glutamate/glutamine are simultaneously consumed, two separate experiments using [U-13C]- and [1-13C]-glucose, respectively, should be performed. If there is a restriction to a single experiment, then the 80:20 mixture of [U-13C]- and [1-13C]-glucose can provide a better resolution than other labelled glucose mixtures (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8). The tools and framework developed in this thesis brings us within reach of performing large-scale, high-resolution fluxomics for animal cells and hence realising systems-level investigation of mammalian metabolism. Moreover, with the establishment of a more rigorous, systematic modelling approach and higher functioning computational tools, we are now at a position to validate mammalian cell culture flux experiments performed 15 years ago.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flux analysis</field><field name="subject">mammalian</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">isotope labelling</field><field name="subject">stoichiometric models</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding molecular weight control of hyaluronic acid production in Streptococcus zooepidemicus: Towards a systems approach</field><field name="creator">Esteban Marcellin</field><field name="description">Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a biopolymer with valuable applications in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The molecular weight of HA is important for its rheological, biological and commercial properties. Currently, high molecular weight HA is extracted from animal sources. Recent pandemic outbreaks of viruses H5N1 and H1N1 (avian and swine influenza) have raised concerns regarding the safety of animal-derived pharmaceuticals; making fermentation the preferred source of HA. Throughout this study, the mechanism of molecular weight control of HA polymerisation in S. zooepidemicus was investigated. While several aspects are still unknown, it was found that levels of activated monomers, (UDP-sugars) have a fundamental role in molecular weight control. High levels of activated sugars strongly correlated with high molecular weight. Throughout rational strain engineering, several strains harbouring a collection of genes were engineered using S. zooepidemicus as a host microorganism. Five genes of the so-called has operon were cloned into a nisin inducible plasmid and transformed into S. zooepidemicus. Several significant changes were observed in HA molecular weight. In order to understand those changes as a complex system, rather than isolated parts of the cell, a systems approach was undertaken. The main goal of this approach was to examine the structure and dynamics of cellular functions using global measurements on changes in proteins or metabolite concentrations, in response to genetic perturbations. As part of the systems biotechnology approach, methods for proteins and metabolites harvesting were optimised. Harvesting metabolites and proteins in microorganisms is a non-trivial process (Chapter 4 and 5). Encapsulated bacteria presents additional challenges since capsular polysaccharides interfere with extraction and downstream analysis. In terms of metabolite harvesting, several studies have reported rapid turnovers in low abundant intracellular sugar metabolites. Four different protocols for cellular harvesting were tested. The best method found was centrifugation, which allowed for efficient medium removal and enabled quantification of the broadest range of sugar metabolites. Unlike observations for other microbes, changes in metabolite pools due to a delay of extraction by centrifugation were not observed. Our hypothesis was that the capsule itself isolates the cells from their surroundings and still supports them with nutrients during cellular harvesting (Chapter 3). Protein harvesting also proved to be technically challenging (Chapter 5), especially when fluorescent dyes were employed for protein visualisation(Chapter 6). Despite this, using hyaluronidase to remove the HA capsule the first reference map for S. zooepidemicus was completed. Besides giving insight into the most abundantly expressed proteins, as well as facilitating the design of better diagnostics and treatments for streptococcal infections, our reference map can be used to engineer superior production strains (Chapter 5). In Chapter 6, proteins involved in MW control were separated using 2D differential in gel electrophoresis (DIGE) and identified by mass spectrometry. Moreover, the wild-type was compared with both the empty vector control strain and a high molecular-weight producing strain harbouring phosphoglucoisomerase (pgi). An enzyme involved in controlling the levels of the intracellular pool of one of the activated sugars, UDP-N-acetylglucosamide-1-carboxivinyltransferase, was down-regulated in the control line. Overexpression of UDP-N-Acetylglucosamide 1-carboxivinyltransferase, decreased both the concentration of activated precursors and HA molecular weight. Gene knockout of one of the copies of that particular gene could potentially guide us to further improvement of the strain. By overexpressing all the genes involved in the HA pathway (Appendix A) we have pushed gene expression as far as possible and the next option was to look at process optimisation. Several studies have found that culture conditions affect HA molecular weight: higher molecular weight is produced under aerobic conditions and when using maltose as the carbon source. To overcome the lower sugar uptake and growth rate observed under maltose, a two stage batch fermentation process was conducted. By feeding glucose when cell growth was stopped through amino acid auxotrophy, we achieved high molecular weight HA production in stationary phase. Using engineered strains, HA &gt;5 MDa was obtained (Chapter 7). This thesis represents a good example of systems biotechnology for strain improvement and is a step forward in understanding the mechanism of molecular weight control of HA production by bacterial fermentation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hyaluronic acid; Molecular weight; polysaccharide; Streptococcus zooepidemicus; systems biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205077</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Economics of Alcohol in Australian Rural Communities</field><field name="creator">Dennis Petrie</field><field name="description">Alcohol is a complex good which is ingrained within the social fabric of Australian culture.

This thesis considers a number of the economic aspects associated with alcohol consumption in rural Australia. This thesis was completed in conjunction with a larger ongoing project: Alcohol Action in Rural Communities (AARC), which is a cost-benefit analysis of community-wide interventions to reduce alcohol-related harm in rural Australia. Given the study involves 20 rural communities in New South Wales, Australia; much of the analysis is centred around data collected from these communities. This thesis examines the amount and patterns of alcohol consumption, some of the associated harms, the value of reducing these harms, plus professionals&#8217; and the public&#8217;s opinions on interventions, viewed as an optimal solution to reduce alcohol-related harm for the communities within this study. First, those factors which affect individuals&#8217; decisions regarding how much alcohol to consume are examined through econometric modelling of the demand for alcohol. Moreover, a theoretical model is derived whereby individuals choose both the intensity and frequency of alcohol consumption in order to maximise their utility. This is then used to examine those factors that affect the relationship between intensity and frequency of alcohol consumption for individuals within the 20 communities of the study. Secondly, the impact that this alcohol consumption has in terms of the effect on morbidity, crime and traffic accidents within these 20 communities is analysed. The relationship between selfreported quality of life using the EQ5D (a quality of life instrument) and self-reported risky alcohol use are examined using ordered Probit and Tobit models. Also, the relationship between community levels of risky drinking and crime and traffic accidents that occur in alcohol-related times is analysed, controlling for the underlying level of crime in the community by using the rate of incidents that occur in non-alcohol-related times. It is found that rural communities in Australia are experiencing a sizeable amount of potentially avoidable harm due to risky alcohol use. Thirdly, the value of reducing alcohol-related harm in these communities, in terms of the amount households are willing to pay for these reductions, is estimated using contingent valuation methods. Individuals&#8217; willingness to pay for a percentage reduction in alcohol-related harm is estimated using both a postal questionnaire for the 20 communities, plus a face-to-face questionnaire conducted in two of these communities. The face-to-face questionnaire is also used to conduct a double-bounded dichotomous choice experiment, to investigate the willingness of households to pay for a reduction in a number of different types of alcohol-related harm. Finally, the views on the optimal policy options to reduce alcohol-related harm for rural communities in Australia are examined for both professionals and the general public. A sample of drug and alcohol (D&amp;A) professionals were asked to allocate a budget of $100,000 to a number of interventions in order to reduce alcohol-related harm in a hypothetical rural community. The D&amp;A professionals most commonly selected interventions include training general practitioners (GPs), targeting high-risk groups, developing a harm-reduction code of practice, expanding social work services and the training of emergency department staff. Additionally, individuals from the general public were asked via a postal questionnaire to allocate a percentage of total funds to eight intervention areas in order to reduce alcohol-related harm in their communities. The top three intervention areas given the most funding, on average, by the public were school-based interventions, educational messages in the media, and greater police enforcement. There is no doubt that alcohol consumption causes a substantial amount of harm for rural communities within Australia. This thesis has provided information to inform the development of interventions tailored to specific communities and has derived estimates which can be used to help evaluate the cost-benefit of these interventions. There is still additional research to be done in order to obtain more accurate estimates of the exact effect alcohol has on rural communities and thus comprehensively evaluate which interventions are likely to be the most cost-effective in reducing this harm.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Rural Australia</field><field name="subject">Crime</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Willingness-to-pay</field><field name="subject">Cost-benefit</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205132</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ROLE OF DENDRITIC EPIDERMAL T-CELLS IN SKIN GRAFT REJECTION</field><field name="creator">Azad Rahimpour</field><field name="description">&#947;&#948; T cells belong to the T cell lineage however they possess some innate like properties. &#947;&#948; T cells recognize non-peptidic microbial and stress induced self antigens in a non-MHC restricted manner and are proposed to bridge the gap between innate and adaptive immunity. Dendritic epidermal T cells are a prototypic population of intraepithelial &#947;&#948; T cells in murine skin. Found in the basal layer of epidermis in close contact with Langerhans cells and keratinocytes DETC facilitate vital immunological and physiological processes e.g. wound healing, homeostasis, tumour surveillance and regulation of inflammation. The purpose of this thesis was to elucidate whether &#947;&#948; T cells and in particular DETC play a role in generation of adaptive immune responses to foreign cutaneous antigen (OVA) in the context of skin grafts. Skin grafting has long been established as a means to test cutaneous and epithelial immunity. To answer this question, &#947;&#948; T cell knock-out mice (TCR&#948;-/-), transgenic K5mOva mice and a skin grafting model were used. It is shown in this study that in the absence of &#947;&#948; in the skin and not in the circulation there is a lower rejection rate of OVA expressing skin grafts. This phenomenon is observed in both freshly placed and well healed grafts. To understand which part of the immune response is affected by the absence of &#947;&#948; T cells the priming and effector phases of the immune response was examined in TCR&#948;-/- mice. The priming phase was studied using two approaches: the first approach was to test priming to maximal doses of subcutaneous antigen in conjunction with an adjuvant and the second approach involved testing priming to an antigen in the context of skin grafts (graft priming). Using ELISPOTs and CFSE proliferation assays we found that while administration of OVA in conjunction with an adjuvant (QuilA) via the subcutaneous route results in sufficient priming in &#947;&#948; T cell knockout mice, cross priming to OVA in the context of - freshly placed and well healed skin grafts is impaired in TCR&#948;-/- mice. By immunizing TCR&#948;-/- mice prior to skin grafting or by transferring in vitro primed OT-I cells to RAG-/- mice grafted with K5mOVA or TCR&#948;-/-OVA skin it was shown that 100% of all OVA grafts are rejected regardless of presence or absence of &#947;&#948; T cells, concluding that effector phase of the immune response is not affected in this model. The inability of DETC to perform the role of cross presentation leads to the hypothesis that DETC indirectly enhance this process by affecting professional antigen presenting cells (APC) of the skin. Based on the contribution of DETC to wound healing it was hypothesized that the migration of dendritic cells (DCs) from the skin grafts to the lymph nodes may be affected. When this hypothesis was tested using hapten sensitization and congenically marked skin grafts it was shown that migration of DCs from skin grafts is not affected by the absence of DETC. In another hypothesis the co-stimulatory markers CD40 and CD86 were examined on migrating DCs found in the skin draining lymph nodes of grafted mice and it was shown that expression levels of those molecules were lower on DCs from TCR&#948;-/- grafted mice compared to C57BL/6 control mice. In addition using cytometric bead array, we show that the cytokine milieu in TCR&#948;-/- skin and skin draining lymph nodes is different from that of wildtype C57 skin and this disparate cytokine profile may be contributing to the less efficient cross priming and graft rejection in TCR&#948;-/- mice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">&#947;&#948; T cells</field><field name="subject">DETC</field><field name="subject">Transplantation</field><field name="subject">Graft rejection</field><field name="subject">Skin</field><field name="subject">TCR&#948;-/-</field><field name="subject">K5mOVA</field><field name="subject">Cross Priming</field><field name="subject">Keratinocytes</field><field name="subject">Innate Immunity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informative correlation extraction from and for Forex market analysis</field><field name="creator">Lei, Song</field><field name="description">The forex market is a complex, evolving, and a non-linear dynamical system, and its forecast is difficult due to high data intensity, noise/outliers, unstructured data and high degree of uncertainty. However, the exchange rate of a currency is often found surprisingly similar to the history or the variation of an alternative currency, which implies that correlation knowledge is valuable for forex market trend analysis. In this research, we propose a computational correlation analysis for the intelligent correlation extraction from all available economic data. The proposed correlation is a synthesis of channel and weighted Pearson's correlation, where the channel correlation traces the trend similarity of time series, and the weighted Pearson's correlation filters noise in correlation extraction. In the forex market analysis, we consider 3 particular aspects of correlation knowledge: (1) historical correlation, correlation to previous market data; (2) cross-currency correlation, correlation to relevant currencies, and (3) macro correlation, correlation to macroeconomic variables. While evaluating the validity of extracted correlation knowledge, we conduct a comparison of Support Vector Regression (SVR) against the correlation aided SVR (cSVR) for forex time series prediction, where correlation in addition to the observed forex time series data is used for the training of SVR. The experiments are carried out on 5 futures contracts (NZD/AUD, NZD/EUD, NZD/GBP, NZD/JPY and NZD/USD) within the period from January 2007 to December 2008. The comparison results show that the proposed correlation is computationally significant for forex market analysis in that the cSVR is performing consistently better than purely SVR on all 5 contracts exchange rate prediction, in terms of error functions MSE, RMSE, NMSE, MAE and MAPE. However, the cSVR prediction is found occasionally differing significantly from the actual price, which suggests that despite the significance of the proposed correlation, how to use correlation knowledge for market trend analysis remains a very challenging difficulty that prevents in practice further understanding of the forex market. In addition, the selection of macroeconomic factors and the determination of time period for analysis are two computationally essential points worth addressing further for future forex market correlation analysis.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Correlation extraction</field><field name="subject">Forex market analysis</field><field name="subject">SVM regression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/899</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a clinical Multiple-Lunge test to predict falls in older adults</field><field name="creator">Wagenaar, Ruth</field><field name="description">Background: The incidence of falls and severity of fall related injuries steadily increase with age. As well as physical injury, falls can lead to adverse psychological and social consequences, which can further reduce older adults&#8217; quality of life. The most commonly reported cause of falls in older persons is tripping over an obstacle, which may reflect the difficulty many older adults have in making an appropriate stepping response. In order to reduce the number of falls experienced by older adults, individuals at high risk of falling need to be identified so that targeted interventions can be implemented. Aims: This series of studies aimed to develop a new Multiple-Lunge test to distinguish between Fallers and Non-fallers in independent older adults, aged 65 years and over. The studies sought to determine the test-retest reliability of the Multiple-Lunge test; as well its validity to predict faller status in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods: One hundred and thirty community-dwelling older adults, aged 65 &#8211; 93 years (mean age 77 &#177; 7 years) with (n = 40) and without (n = 90) a history of falls were administered the Multiple-Lunge test. For the purpose of this study, a Faller was classified as an older adult with a history of one fall, or a Multiple-faller if there was a history of two or more falls in the previous 12 months. The Multiple-Lunge test required the individual to lunge forward to a step length determined as 60% of their leg length, and return to start position, for a total of five repetitions. Two trials were performed after a familiarisation trial. The number of correct steps and the total time for the five steps were recorded for each trial. The highest number of correct steps and the lowest total time of the two trials were used for data analysis. Test-retest reliability of the Multiple-Lunge test was established across two testing occasions from a sub-sample of the validity study (n = 14, mean age 79 &#177; 6 years). A cross-sectional design was used to establish the sensitivity and specificity of the Multiple-Lunge test to predict faller status based on retrospective self-reported fall history. Initial analysis using the number of correct steps and total time, was followed by a linear regression analysis to determine the validity of the test to predict falls. Results: The Multiple-Lunge test was found to be reliable across trials (ICC = 0.79 for number of correct steps; ICC = 0.86 for total time). The change in the mean for steps was small and similar across four trials (-0.43 steps, -0.36 steps, -0.50 steps). The change in the mean for time showed a gradual decrease in time scores across trials (-0.69 seconds, -0.73 seconds, -0.93 seconds). Sensitivity and specificity values were calculated as 73% and 63% for predicting Multiple-fallers using the measure of all five steps done correctly. Linear regression analysis did not indicate that the Multiple-Lunge test could be used to predict faller status for either of the step predictor variables (0/5 steps or 5/5 steps). However, a very high sensitivity value (98%) was observed for the variable of both steps and time in predicting Fallers. Also a very high specificity value (99%) was recorded for the variable of time to predict Multiple-fallers. Conclusions: The Multiple-Lunge test is an easily administered test for independent older adults. Due to the challenging nature of the test it may be well suited to detect subtle differences in abilities of higher functioning older adults. The test mimics the movements needed in response to a trip, the most common cause of falls in older adults. This test is a reliable and reasonably valid measure of falls risk. A practitioner can be confident in 7 out of 10 cases that an older adult who cannot complete all five steps of the Multiple-Lunge test is at high risk of falls. The results of this thesis suggest that there is potential for the Multiple-Lunge test to be used in clinical practice and fall prevention research. However, additional research on how to further increase its validity and/or to determine the most appropriate populations with which to administer this test appears warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Older adult</field><field name="subject">Test</field><field name="subject">Fall prediction</field><field name="subject">Physical</field><field name="subject">Gerontology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/901</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution of the chemical composition and surface properties of plasma polymerised thin film coatings /</field><field name="creator">Gengenbach, Thomas R</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 1999</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasma chemistry</field><field name="subject">Surface chemistry</field><field name="subject">Thin films</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/85669</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43027</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spaces between :</field><field name="creator">Gelade, Sue</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to fill the gap by identifying some of the experiences that being an Australian expatriate teacher in Papua New Guinea engenders.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Teachers, Foreign</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/85662</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43018</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Audio interfaces for the employment of short range air-to-air missiles /</field><field name="creator">Garner, Shawn</field><field name="description">An upgrade in technology has changed the way audio feedback is given to fighter pilots when using short range infrared guided air-to-air missiles.

means of dealing with socially constructed, complex human activity problems. It investigates how visualisation is used to facilitate the process of thinking about complex human problems. The most common and popular form of problem sketching appears to be 'rich pictures' as attributed to Checkland from the 1960s, as a part of Soft Systems Methodology (SSM). However, many users of rich picturing no longer consider it as only available to SSM users, rather it has become a stand-alone, if poorly defined, problem sketching method. Meanwhile, in the U.S., Churchman's (1950, 1968, 1971, 1975, 1979 and 1982) interpretation of systems thinking as multiple perspectival thinking has also been advocated by many writers as a useful approach to human activity problem solving. This approach does not seem to have an associated problem sketching method. This thesis therefore uses perspectival thinking as a frame to research problem sketching generally and rich pictures in particular.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual perception</field><field name="subject">Visualization.</field><field name="subject">Problem solving</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81421</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43929</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel methods of transduction for active control of harmonic sound radiated by vibrating surfaces</field><field name="creator">Burgemeister, Kym A.</field><field name="description">Large electric transformers such as those used in high voltage substations radiate an annoying low frequency hum into nearby communities. Attempts have been made to actively control the noise by placing a large number of loudspeakers as control sources around noisy transformers to cancel the hum. These cancellation systems require a large number of loudspeakers to be successful due to the imposing size of the transformer structures. Thus such systems are very expensive if global noise reduction is to be achieved. The aim of this thesis is to investigate theoretically and experimentally the use of thin perforated panels closely placed to a heavy structure to reduce the radiation of unwanted harmonic noise. These panels can themselves be vibrated to form a control source radiating over a large surface surrounding the primary source. The problem of the equipment overheating inside the enclosure is alleviated because the holes in the panels still allow natural cooling. An initial study is carried out to determine the resonance frequencies of perforated panels. The use of previously determined effective elastic properties of the panels and Finite Element Analysis to theoretically calculate their resonance frequencies is examined. Secondly the attenuation provided by active noise control using perforated panels as control sources is explored by use of a coupled analysis, where the primary source is assumed to influence the radiation of the perforated control panel. This analysis was found to predict poorly the amount of attenuation that could be achieved, so an uncoupled analysis is undertaken, where both the primary and control sources are assumed to radiate independently of each other. Not only does this greatly simplify the theoretical analysis but it also enables prediction of attenuation levels which are comparable to those determined experimentally. The theoretical model is reformulated to enable comparison of the sound power attenuation provided by perforated panel control sources with that of traditional acoustic and structural control sources. Finally, the use of modal filtering of traditional acoustic error sensor signals to give transformed mode (or power mode) sensors is examined. The independently radiating acoustic transformed modes of the panel are determined by an eigenanalysis and a theoretical analysis is presented for a farfield acoustic power sensor system to provide a direct measurement of the total radiated acoustic power. The frequency dependence of the sensor system, and the amount of global sound power attenuation that can be achieved is examined. Experimental measurements are made to verify the theoretical model and show that a sound power sensor implemented with acoustic sensors can be used in a practical active noise control system to increase the amount of attenuation that can be achieved. Alternatively the sound power sensor can be used to reduce the number of error channels required by a control system to obtain a given level of attenuation when compared to traditional error criteria. The power mode sensor analysis is then applied to the perforated panel control system, with similar results.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Active noise control, Transformers, Perforated panels</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37932</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental field studies and predictive modelling of PCB and PCDD/F levels in Australian farmed Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii).</field><field name="creator">Phua, Samuel Tien Gin</field><field name="description">Farmed Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) (Thunnus maccoyii) is an important export product for South Australia (SA). It is exported to Japan, China, Korea and the United States for the sushi and sashimi markets. The primary purpose of SBT farming in SA is to fatten wild-caught juvenile fish (2-4 years of age with initial mean weights between 12-20 kg) over a period of approximately five months by feeding a selection of baitfish types. Farmers, farm managers and consumers of SBT all have an interest in managing chemical residues that have the potential to biomagnify in the fatty tissue of the farmed SBT fillets. Of particular interest are chemical residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins / dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This research presents the investigations and experimental validation of a predictive model that can be used to address the levels of residues in the fillets of farmed SBT at harvest from feeding (as the source) when applied to SBT aquaculture. An additional industry-focussed aim of this research was to determine if a Longer Term Holding (LTH) farming period, with a duration of an extra 12 months after a typical farming period of approximately five months, could produce SBT with higher condition index (CI) and lipid content, while keeping levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs low, compared to the typical farming period. The justification for this research is that an adequate quantitative model is essential to help industry achieve targeted concentrations in the final fillet product by making scientific-based decisions on baitfish selection (baitfish strategies for the feeding of SBT), and longer term, to confidently demonstrate to local markets and importing countries that Australia is actively managing levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in farmed SBT, to ensure a high quality and safe product is delivered to the consumer. The novelty of this research is underpinned by four integrated stages, and the criteria for an adequate model established. The important criteria included: accurate predictions versus observed data demonstrated through the analysis of residual plots, potential physiological interpretation of model coefficients, parsimony &#8211; the model should be as simple as possible (but no simpler) and that the model should be easy to use. Firstly, a logical starting point was the development of a risk framework for residues in SBT. The developed framework was based on conventional principles of microbiological risk assessment highlighted in Codex Alimentarius. The risk framework consists of five governing principles: hazard identification, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment, risk characterisation and model validation. The advantages of the risk framework is that it provides a systematic research approach and permits information to be handled unambiguously, especially important for the niche SBT industry where chemical residue research is carried out for the first time. Secondly, because of a lack of available scientific data in context of this research, commercial-scale experimental field data for levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in typical farmed SBT as affected by feeding and growth were collected over 17 months at seven time intervals from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd in 2005/06 (n = 50). Field data from another commercial company, Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd, was collected over the typical farming period specific to this company, spanning 15 weeks at three time intervals in 2006, for validation work (n = 15). The data obtained from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd revealed that whole weight of farmed SBT increased from 18.5 kg to 30.3 kg for a typical farming period, and subsequently to 41.0 kg by the end of the LTH farming period. A maximum mean CI of 24.0 &#177; 0.5 kg.m&#8315;&#179; and a maximum mean lipid content of 17.6 &#177; 0.5% was achieved at the third time interval of the typical farming period, for the baitfish types and ratios used as feed. There were no significant differences in the CI and lipid between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods, i.e. even after an additional 12 months of farming. PCB and PCDD/F concentrations, however, increased between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods. The data indicated that a typical farming period was sufficient to achieve a maximum CI and lipid content with lower concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in the fillets relative to the LTH farming period. For the third stage of this research, a quantitative model was synthesised and applied to the PCB and PCDD/F (2,3,7,8-TeCDF) data detected in farmed SBT fillets. Assimilation efficiencies for PCBs and 2,3,7,8-TeCDF in the fillets of SBT were obtained. An assimilation efficiency, or percentage retention (efficiency expressed as a percentage), in the fillet of SBT is a measure of the uptake of a chemical residue from food (baitfish) to the SBT fillet. For the WHO-PCBs, assimilation efficiencies based on SBT fillets ranged between 19.1 &#8211; 35.3 % with the exception of PCB 169. The highest assimilation efficiency of 35.3 %, with a range of 30.4 &#8211; 40.3 % (at the 95 % confidence level) was attributed to the most toxic PCB congener, PCB 126. An assimilation efficiency of 39.2 % was determined in SBT fillets for the congener 2,3,7,8-TeCDF, which was higher than the assimilation efficiencies determined for the WHO-PCB congeners. A residual plot as predicted value versus observed value indicated that the predictive model was neither under- or over-parameterised. However, when the predictive model was assessed against the data set from Farm Alpha Pty Ltd, the model over-predicted the actual PCB and PCDD/F concentrations. The over-prediction is attributed to possible overfeeding of SBT farmed by Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd. From a food safety point of view, in the absence of ideal predictions because of a lack of ideal validation data sets, an over-prediction instead of under-prediction is preferred. In the fourth stage, the practical application of the predictive model was demonstrated. Because SBT fillets are retailed as tissue group-specific, i.e. akami (low fat), chu-toro (medium fat) and otoro (high fat) fillets, PCB and PCDD/F analyses were carried out on the three tissue groups for selected SBT (n = 7). Dietary modelling on SBT consumption in humans was carried out using findings from the predictive model and tissue-specific data. The baitfish strategy employed for the feeding of farmed SBT consequently affects dietary exposure to SBT consumers. Exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is approximately seven times lower for the consumption of a skin-free, boneless akami fillet than for a comparable otoro fillet of the same size. This dietary exposure assessment accounted only for consumption of SBT tissue-specific fillets. The experimental field study and modelling work on PCB and PCDD/F concentrations in farmed SBT (fillets) outlined in this thesis importantly directs the need to re-evaluate a specific model to better cater for SBT farming practices where SBT fillets are produced for human consumption. Because conditions that normally pertain to commercial farming of wild-caught fish were studied, findings should be of interest to industries where other species of fish (for food) are farmed in sea-cages in the open ocean.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical residues; fish; Southern Bluefin Tuna; predictive modelling; PCBs; PCDD/Fs; bipheyls; dioxins; biomagnification model</field><field name="subject">Bluefin tuna Australia</field><field name="subject">Bluefin tuna fisheries Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58572</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molybdenum transport in plants.</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Kate Louise</field><field name="description">Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient required by plants. It is biologically inactive until bound in a pterin compound named the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) that binds to apoproteins used in both reductive and oxidative reactions such as nitrate reductase (NR), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase (AO) and sulfite oxidase (SOX). In Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot, molybdenum deficiency is common amongst vines grown on own roots in acidic soils often resulting in yield reductions. Foliar application of molybdenum sprays increases yield and remedies deficiency indicating that Merlot grown on own roots has a reduced capacity for molybdenum uptake from the soil. Molybdenum generally occurs as molybdate (MoO&#8324;  &#178;&#8315;) within the soil solution. The mechanism(s) involved in molybdenum transport have recently been discovered in plants, although are well characterised within prokaryotic systems. Unfortunately, no homologues of prokaryotic genes involved in molybdate transport exist within eukaryotes. It has been suggested that molybdenum transport in plants may occur through other systems including sulfate transporters due to chemical similarities between sulfate and molybdate. A yeast functional complementation approach using a sulfate transport mutant was initially used to identify novel putative plant molybdenum transport proteins. A cDNA library derived from Pinot noir roots starved of molybdenum was screened for transporters. Unfortunately, no cDNAs were identified that met the requirements of a molybdenum transporter when screened on media containing low amounts of molybdenum. However, a number of putative cDNA&#8217;s partially complemented the yeast mutant YSD1, however none of these could be validated in second round screens. A candidate gene approach was then initiated to identify pre-characterised genes that may also have capacity to transport molybdenum. The plant sulfate transporter, SHST1, restored growth of YSD1 on media containing low amounts of molybdenum. Kinetic analysis using &#8313;&#8313;MoO&#8324;&#178;&#8315; to trace molybdenum transport in yeast cells demonstrated that SHST1 enhanced the uptake of molybdenum at nM concentrations. The uptake was not inhibited by sulfate, but the transport of sulfate was reduced with molybdenum. Further analysis demonstrated that SHST1 did prefer sulfate as the substrate but molybdenum could compete at higher concentrations. This result is the first measurement of molybdenum being transported through a pre characterised sulfate transport protein. Whole plant experiments using rooted grapevine cuttings and &#8313;&#8313;MoO&#8324;&#178;&#8315; to trace molybdenum movement into plants indicated that Merlot did not have reduced capacity to uptake molybdenum compared to other varieties that do not suffer from molybdenum deficiencies such as Chardonnay. When plants were grown with molybdenum, Merlot accumulated more molybdenum than Chardonnay, with the reverse being true when plants were grown without molybdenum. Similar experiments were performed on symbiosomes isolated from Glycine max grown with and without molybdenum. Symbiosomes absorbed more molybdenum when plants were grown without molybdenum. A field site was established to look at the molybdenum profiles within petioles against yield responses over a 3-year period. Molybdenum application did not increase the yield amongst vines despite all vines initially being deficient in molybdenum. There were no cumulative effects of molybdenum application over the trial, however, molybdenum did have limited translocation ability within the vine system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molybdenum transport; sulfate transport; SHST1; YSD1; grapevine; molybdenum nutrition</field><field name="subject">Molybdenum</field><field name="subject">Plants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58573</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a dominant negative androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.</field><field name="creator">Centenera, Margaret Mary</field><field name="description">Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in Australian men. As prostate cancer cells are reliant on androgens for growth and survival, the standard therapy for metastatic disease is androgen ablation therapy (AAT). AAT inhibits androgen signalling by altering androgen synthesis or prevent binding of androgens to their intracellular mediator, the androgen receptor (AR). Although initially effective, virtually all patients relapse, beyond which there are limited treatment options. The failure of AAT is not necessarily due to a decreased requirement for androgen signalling, but rather the AR is able to maintain signalling and tumour growth in an androgen-depleted environment. Therefore novel strategies that directly target the AR may provide a more effective therapeutic approach.   We have endeavoured to suppress AR activity in prostate cancer cells by utilising a dominant negative AR. The most effective dominant negative construct developed, ARi41O, lacks amino acids 39-410 in the AR amino terminal transactivation domain. In studies of transcriptional activity, ARi410 has no intrinsic activity but inhibits the activity of wild type AR (wtAR) and also clinically relevant AR variants, by up to 95%. The objective of this thesis was to characterise the mechanisms of action of ARi410 and assess the functional effects of introducing this dominant negative receptor into prostate cancer cells.   To investigate the mechanism by which ARi410 suppresses AR activity, a robust and sensitive AR inhibition assay was developed. This assay revealed that ARi410 is a potent inhibitor of AR activity on three independent AR-regulated promoters, regardless of the level of AR expression. Furthermore, while ARi410 can inhibit AR activity, it does not alter AR protein levels. By using ARi410 variants with mutations and/or deletions in regions of functional importance, the AR inhibition assay was also used to identify the critical regions of ARi410 required for its dominant negative activity. These studies demonstrate that the  dominant negative activity of ARi41 0 is ligand-dependent, requires dimerisation through the ligand binding domain (LBD) and an intact DNA-binding domain (DBD).   Further investigation into the mechanism of dominant negative activity revealed that ARi410 does not alter the subcellular localisation of AR, as both receptors are predominantly cytoplasmic in the absence of ligand and rapidly co-localise to the nucleus in response to androgens. Furthermore, an interaction between AR and ARi410 was observed in the presence and absence of ligand, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that AR and ARi410 form heterodimers on DNA. These studies led to the conclusion that the mechanism of dominant negative activity by ARi4I0 involves the formation of inactive receptor heterodimers that assemble on DNA and suppress AR activity.   To determine the functional consequence of expressing the dominant negative androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells, an adenoviral method of gene delivery was developed. Adenoviral expression of ARi410 in LNCaP prostate cancer cells did not allow assessment of cell viability due to cell-specific toxicity of the viral vectors when expressed long-term. However, short-term expression of ARi410 in LNCaP cells resulted in inhibition of AR signalling, as determined by reduced expression of the androgen regulated genes apolipoprotein D and kallikrein 2. Importantly, this finding is consistent with the inhibitory activity of ARi410 observed using synthetic AR-regulated reporter genes in the AR inhibition assay, and demonstrates that ARi410 can effectively suppress endogenous AR signalling.   The results of this thesis indicate that heterodimerisation between AR and ARi410 is the most likely mechanism of dominant negative inhibition of AR function by ARi410, and that the DBD and dimerisation through the LBD are required for optimal dominant negative activity. Furthermore, this thesis has demonstrated that ARi410 is an effective inhibitor of AR signalling and provides a basis for further functional studies and evaluation of the dominant negative androgen receptor in vitro and in vivo.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">androgen receptor; prostate cancer; dominant negative; inhibitor</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58574</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic analysis and manipulation of economically important traits in bread wheat.</field><field name="creator">Kuchel, Haydn</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to firstly gain an improved understanding of the genetic basis to economically important complex traits in bread wheat, and secondly, to investigate marker assisted selection (MAS) methodologies that may lead to improved rates of genetic gain. An elite Australian breeder's line, 'Stylet', and its parents 'Trident' and 'Molineux' were used as the basis of this study. A doubled-haploid (DH) population previously produced from a cross between 'Trident' and 'Molineux' (TIM DH) was used to dissect the genetic basis to end-use quality and agronomic performance. The study of end-use quality confirmed the widely published relationship between the glutenin loci and dough rheology. However this study also identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 2A that was shown to be associated with dough resistance and baking quality, and another QTL on 3A that was associated with baking quality. QTL were identified in the T/M DH population that were involved in the control of time to ear-emergence through their effects on vernalisation sensitivity, photoperiod sensitivity and earliness per se. In addition to the well characterised Vrn-A1 and Ppd-B1 genes, six other QTL were identified. Three of these, QPpd.agt-1A, QPpd.agt-7A and QPpd.agt-7B are putative new loci involved in the control of photoperiod sensitivity in wheat. QPpd.agt-1A appears homoeologous to the photoperiod response gene Ppd-H2 in barley. QPpd.agt-7A and QPpd.agt-7B are located in homoeologous regions, and may represent a new phenology gene series in wheat. The T/M DH population was also used to dissect the genetic basis to grain yield and grain yield components, and to examine the influence of QTL-by environmental covariable interaction on genotype-by-environment interaction. The association of plant height genes, rust resistance genes and phenology genes with grain yield were determined. Overall, semi-dwarf rust resistant DH lines, carrying alleles conferring a short time to ear-emergence, showed the highest and most stable grain yield. Nine genetic associations with grain yield, without effects on plant height, time to ear-emergence and rust resistance, were identified. Two QTL, QGyld.agt-1B and QGyld.agt-4D were shown to have large and frequent associations with grain yield. QGyld.agt-1B showed only low levels of interaction with environmental covariables and therefore constitutes a prime candidate for MAS for grain yield. The second part of this study investigated the potential role of MAS through a practical breeding strategy and by computer simulation. An 'Anneullo/2*Stylet' cross aimed at producing a rust resistant 'Stylet' derivative with improved end-use quality was used as the model for this analysis. MAS was shown to be highly effective at improving the rate of genetic gain for rust resistance and end-use quality. This was most evident when undertaken on the BC&#8321;F&#8321;  population, although MAS also improved the efficiency of the breeding programme when performed on fixed lines. Practical implementation of the MAS breeding strategy validated the results from the simulation study and produced elite lines approaching the grain yield level of 'Stylet', with resistance to leaf, stem and stripe rust, and with improved end-use quality. While the results from this study highlight the complex nature of the major economically important traits being manipulated by wheat breeders, this study also concluded that improvements in rate of genetic gain are possible through the application of MAS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58575</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of single and multiple faults under varying load conditions using multiple sensor types to improve condition monitoring of induction machines.</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Intesar</field><field name="description">Condition monitoring involves taking measurements on an induction motor while it is operating in order to detect faults. For this purpose normally a single sensor type, for example current is used to detect broken rotor bar using fault frequency components only under the full-load condition or a limited number of load cases. The correlations among the different types of sensors and their ability to diagnose single and multiple faults over a wide range of loads have not been the focused in previous research. Furthermore, to detect different faults in machines using any fault frequency components, it is important to investigate the variability in its amplitude to other effects apart from fault severity and load. This area has also often been neglected in the literature on condition monitoring. The stator current and axial flux have been widely used as suitable sensors for detecting different faults i.e. broken rotor bar and eccentricity faults in motors. Apart from detecting the broken rotor bar faults in generalized form, the use of instantaneous power signal has often been neglected in the literature condition monitoring. This thesis aims to improve machine condition monitoring and includes accurate and reliable detection of single and multiple faults (faults in the presence of other faults) in induction machines over a wide range of loads of rated output by using current, flux and instantaneous power as the best diagnostic medium. The research presents the following specific tasks: A comprehensive real database from non&#8211;invasive sensor measurements, i.e. vibration measurements, axial flux, 3-phase voltage, 3-phase current and speed measurements of induction motor is obtained by using laboratory testing on a large set of identical motors with different single and multiple faults. Means for introducing these faults of varying severity have been developed for this study. The collected data from the studied machines has been analysed using a custom-written analysis programme to detect the severity of different faults in the machines. This helps to improve the accuracy and reliability in detecting of single and multiple faults in motors using fault frequency components from current, axial flux and instantaneous power spectra. This research emphasises the importance of instantaneous power as a medium of detecting different single and multiple faults in induction motor under varying load conditions. This enables the possibility of obtaining accurate and reliable diagnostic medium to detect different faults existing in machines, which is vital in providing a new direction for future studies into condition monitoring. Another feature of this report is to check the variability in healthy motors due to: test repeatability, difference between nominally identical motors, and differences between the phases of the same motor. This has been achieved by conducting extensive series of laboratory tests to examine fault frequency amplitudes versus fault severity, load, and other factors such as test repeatability and machine phases. The information about the variations in the amplitudes of the fault frequency components is used to check the accuracy and reliability of the experimental set-up, which is necessary for the practical application of the results to reliably detect the different faults in the machines reliably. Finally, this study also considers the detection of eccentricity faults using fault frequency amplitudes as a function of average eccentricity, instead of as a function of load under different levels of loading. This has not been reported in previous studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">condition monitoring; induction machines; broken rotor bars; eccentricity; stator faults</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58576</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Software-centric and interaction-oriented system-on-chip verification.</field><field name="creator">Xu, Xiao Xi</field><field name="description">As the complexity of very-large-scale-integrated-circuits (VLSI) soars, the complexity of verifying them increases even faster. Design verification becomes the biggest bottleneck in VLSI design, consuming around 70% of the effort and time in a typical design cycle. The problem is even more severe as the system-on-chip (SoC) design paradigm is gaining popularity. Unfortunately, the development in verification techniques has not kept up with the growth of the design capability, and is being left further behind in the SoC era. In recent years, a new generation of hardware-modelling-languages alongside the best practices to use them have emerged and evolved in an attempt to productively build an intelligent stimulationobservation environment referred to as the test-bench. Ironically, as test-benches are becoming more powerful and sophisticated under these best practices known as verification methodologies, the overall verification approaches today are still officially described as ad hoc and experimental and are in great need of a methodological breakthrough. Our research was carried out to seek the desirable methodological breakthrough, and this thesis presents the research outcome: a novel and holistic methodology that brings an opportunity to address the SoC verification problems. Furthermore, our methodology is a solution completely independent of the underlying simulation technologies; therefore, it could extend its applicability into future VLSI designs. Our methodology presents two ideas. (a) We propose that system-level verification should resort to the SoC-native languages rather than the test-bench construction languages; the software native to the SoC should take more critical responsibilities than the test-benches. (b) We challenge the fundamental assumption that &#8220;objects-under-test&#8221; and &#8220;tests&#8221; are distinct entities; instead, they should be understood as one type of entities &#8211; the interactions; interactions, together with the interference between interactions, i.e., the parallelism and resource-competitions, should be treated as the focus in system-level verification. The above two ideas, namely, software-centric verification and interaction-oriented verification have yielded practical techniques. This thesis elaborates on these techniques, including the transfer-resource-graph based test-generation method targeting the parallelism, the coverage measures of the concurrency completeness using Petri-nets, the automation of the test-programs which can execute smartly in an event-driven manner, and a software observation mechanism that gives insights into the system-level behaviours.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VLSI; system-on-chip; verification; simulation; methodology; modelling; parallelism; test generation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58577</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Declining water quality as a driver of changes to subtidal communities.</field><field name="creator">Gorman, Daniel</field><field name="description">This body of work examines the influence of land use on nearshore water quality, and how this can drive changes to algal and invertebrate communities along Australia's southern coastline. The overall aim of the thesis was to investigate links between increasing coastal water-column nitrogen concentrations (derived from terrestrial inputs) and the expansion of turf-forming habitats that can alter the structure and function of subtidal ecosystems. I initially tested whether human activities in coastal catchments can increase subsidies of nitrogen to open rocky coasts. I identified landscape-scale variation in the supply of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) to coastal waters adjacent to natural, agricultural and urban catchments. Compared to natural catchments, subsidies of DIN were 8 - 407 times greater in urban catchments, and 1 - 63 times greater in agricultural catchments. Subsidies of nitrogen from urban catchments were attributed to the release of sewage effluent, as delineated by &#948;&#185;  &#8309;N isotopic values of transplanted algae. Having made this link, I then assessed whether catchment-scale variation in nitrogen subsidies may predict patterns of subtidal habitat structure, particularly as related to theories of regime shifts from forested landscapes to structurally depauperate turf-forming habitats. I validated this hypothesis, demonstrating that both relative covers and patch-sizes of turfed habitat were greater where the ratio of terrestrial nitrogen inputs to ambient coastal resources was large. An important realisation was that loss of forests may be more strongly related to the size of subsidy (i.e. the relative increases in water column nitrogen concentrations along urban coasts) rather than the size of coastal populations. Together, these data link coastal development with modified land-to-sea subsidies, and indirectly support the model that ecological effects may be proportional to the disparity between donor and recipient resources. Having demonstrated a link between nitrogen subsidies and subtidal habitat change, I then investigated factors likely to initiate and maintain such shifts. My results demonstrate that nutrient elevation can alter the natural phenology of turfs, sustaining dense covers throughout periods of natural senescence (winter). Perennial turf covers are able to accumulate large volumes of sediment; a synergy can impede the winter recruitment of canopy-forming species (kelps and fucoid algae). My observations of reduced forest recovery along urban coasts serve to highlight the complex interaction between elevated nutrients, persistent turf covers and increased sediment accumulation, which can reduce the resilience of coastal ecosystems to disturbance. In recognition that regime shifts are likely to have consequences for higher trophic levels, I compared the diet of invertebrate herbivores from healthy and degraded coastlines using stable isotope analysis (&#948;&#185;&#179;C and &#948;&#185;&#8309;N). Dietary modelling showed that turfs contributed more to the diet of consumers along degraded coastlines where turfed landscapes have replaced extensive covers of macroalgal forest. Additionally, there were strong correlations between covers of turfed habitat, herbivore diet and relative densities. Changes to ambient food quality associated with regime shift may be an important aspect of nutrient-driven change along human-dominated coastlines. The final component of my thesis redressed some of the uncertainty about restoration initiatives for urban coasts by demonstrating that regime shifts are not necessarily permanent. I showed that turf removal can facilitate the recovery of degraded forests. Future restoration, therefore, is a possible outcome of polices that aim to decouple the link between nutrient inputs and recalcitrant turfed habitats that prevent forest recovery. Initiatives that reduce nutrient discharge to coastal waters (e.g., wastewater recycling) are likely to restore the resilience of nearshore marine ecosystems and promote their rehabilitation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine ecology Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58578</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the lower troposphere.</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Simon Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis uses several remote sensing techniques to study properties of the boundary layer and lower troposphere. For historical reasons, radiosondes are the standard atmospheric sampling technique which other observations are compared against. However, they are limited in time and space and only provide a 'snapshot' of the atmosphere. Due to the remoteness of many areas in Australia, there is a need to obtain more meteorological data than the sporadic radiosonde and surface weather station information provide. As a consequence, different ground-based remote sensing systems are used to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of atmospheric sampling. Radar, Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and surface weather data are studied to evaluate their potential for remote sensing. If successful, these techniques could compliment current radiosonde observations and be used in forecasting models. A RASS system was integrated with the two VHF radars at the Buckland Park field site in order to obtain high-resolution temperature profiles of the lower atmosphere. Initial testing showed that the manufacturer's stated orientation of the RASS speakers was incorrect. Changing their orientation increased the power transmitted skyward. RASS echoes were recorded with the Stratosphere-Troposphere radar (ST) RASS system up to 6 km under calm conditions. The Boundary Layer Radar (BLR) measured echoes up to 2.5 km. An existing acoustic ray-tracing algorithm was expanded into two dimensions and modified for use with the ST radar to allow prediction of the acoustic spot's movement. This facilitated beam-steering of the radar to track the acoustic spot so that it was within a beam. Implementation of this algorithm met with partial success. Beam-steering enabled some RASS measurements to higher altitudes than only using the vertical beam, under meteorologically disturbed conditions. However, the ST radar is still limited by only permitting beam-steering in the cardinal directions. No datasets of sufficient quality were obtainable with either VHF radar, due to acoustic spot distortion and movement. The BLR-RASS coverage was very sensitive to increased wind speeds, due to the small size of the receiving antenna. The Bureau of Meteorology operates a UHF radar in Western Sydney, which also has a RASS capability. A seven day dataset from this radar was used to study the thermodynamics and structure of the boundary layer below 1 km. A strong diurnal temperature component was evident, the strength of which decreased with increasing altitude. Second order parameters such as heat flux and Brunt-V&#228;is&#228;l&#228; frequency were calculated and results were in general agreement with the structure of the boundary layer. Comparisons between the UHF radar and two VHF Boundary Layer Radars (one at Adelaide and the other at Sydney airport) revealed a better coverage of wind observations in the lowest 1500 m with the UHF. Above this height, the VHF BLRs measured a greater proportion of winds than the UHF radar. Microwave signals from GPS satellites are delayed in the troposphere due to the effects of water vapour. Certain GPS processing packages calculate this tropospheric delay as a by-product of position determination. Consequently, high temporal resolution estimates of precipitable water vapour (PWV) can be made with GPS. Adelaide-specific regression parameters were derived from the local climatology to increase the accuracy of the GPS PWV. The values of the PWV compared favourably with established radiosonde calculations of water vapour. A study of the passage of a cold front over the Buckland Park field site showed that the changes in water vapour agreed with measurements of other parameters including rainfall and synoptic-scale wind field changes. An annual precipitable water vapour spectrum was dominated by synoptic events, with summer and autumn exhibiting the largest changes in water vapour quantity. Currently, GPS cannot detect the sea-breeze as the uncertainties are too large. Research into real-time estimates of water vapour has shown it to be of sufficient quality for potential use in forecasting models. This is believed to be the first demonstration of real-time GPS feasibility in the Australian region. Two case studies of gravity waves emitted by cold fronts are also presented. VHF BLR data as well as a network of surface Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) were used to determine the wave parameters. Both waves preceded the fronts by at least one hour and propagated perpendicularly to the background wind field. Neither gravity wave event appeared to be associated with observed precipitation. The first event in January 2003 had excellent BLR radar coverage, allowing use of the wind perturbations for wave parameter calculations. However, during the second event (in March 2003), the BLR had a low signal to noise ratio, resulting in large data gaps. This meant that AWS data was relied on for wave parameter calculations. Radar data of insufficient quality resulted in no other waves being identified during other frontal events. In summary, the limits of the VHF-RASS systems were reached during these studies. In their present configurations, the VHF radars are not able to consistently observe temperature profiles. The GPS water vapour measurements and the gravity wave detection from radar wind data demonstrated the success of these techniques for obtaining information. Further investigation of these methods may enable a better understanding of the weather in Australia and potential integration into the observation network.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58579</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and behaviour of Pachycephala rufogularis and P. inornata (Aves: Pachycephalidae) in woodlands of South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Moise, Dragos</field><field name="description">Since European settlement, the woodlands and associated habitats, especially in the temperate zones of Australia, have been extensively cleared and converted to arable land and pastures. Much of the remaining vegetation in the agricultural zone occurs as small isolated patches prone to disturbance and degradation. Apart from habitat loss and fragmentation, altered fire regimes, periods of intense drought, and the introduction of exotic plants and animals, have contributed to the deterioration of most of the natural habitats across Australia, with a negative impact on the native wildlife, including birds. Many woodland bird species have undergone widespread declines, culminating in some local or even regional extinctions. In the mallee woodlands of south-east Australia two closely related species of whistlers (fam. Pachycephalidae) &#8212; Red-lored Whistler Pachycephala rufogularis and Gilbert&#8217;s Whistler P. inornata &#8212; have overlapping ranges, and in some areas they co-exist. These two species are morphologically and ecologically similar. However, despite the similarities, P. rufogularis has undergone greater declines in distribution and abundance than P. inornata. The ecology of these two species is poorly known, which renders adequate management impracticable. The major objectives of this thesis were to determine the key habitat requirements for the two species, to determine their habitat use, and to document the ecology and behaviour of the two species, particularly their foraging, and intra- and interspecific interactions. A sound knowledge of the ecology of the two species is needed to underpin appropriate actions for their management and conservation. Morphological features were measured from skins of P. rufogularis and P. inornata in the South Australian Museum collection, and from captured live birds, to detect if any aspect of the morphology could indicate possible niche partitioning between the two species. Also, the use of biometry as a tool for separating the sexes for P. rufogularis, for determining the species of the uncoloured immature birds and for sexing immatures, was evaluated. No morphological feature suggested niche partitioning. The biometry did not prove a very reliable tool for distinguishing sexes in adult P. rufogularis, but reliably identified the species of the uncoloured immatures. Sexing immatures based on biometrical data alone was not possible. Research was conducted in two main South Australian parks: Gluepot Reserve and Ngarkat Conservation Park. Ecological and behavioural data for P. rufogularis and P. inornata were collected by observing marked (colour-banded and radio-tagged) and unmarked individual birds of both species and sexes, over a two-year period from June 2004 to May 2006. The home ranges of P. rufogularis and P. inornata were determined by tracking the movements of birds in the landscape. Pachycephala rufogularis had much larger home ranges than P. inornata, especially when breeding. The striking differences in home range size between the two ecologically similar species might be related to differences in site fidelity. Pachycephala rufogularis at Gluepot was sedentary, being detected in the same locations throughout the year, and over several years. On the contrary, P. inornata generally showed poor site fidelity, being more mobile, and shifting home ranges between and within seasons. In the field the two species were segregated by habitat. Pachycephala rufogularis and P. inornata showed different habitat preferences, even in areas where they did not co-occur. Pachycephala rufogularis favoured low mallee with Triodia on sand dunes, while P. inornata favoured tall mallee with sparse shrub understorey in interdunes, but also other habitats, such as prickly Acacia thickets and Casuarina woodlands. However, both species used the mallee- Triodia with Callitris vegetation type. The key to coexistence in this habitat was a behavioural one, P. inornata acting as a subordinate species. Pachycephala rufogularis had strict habitat requirements, with the presence of Triodia being critical for the presence of the species. In contrast, P. inornata was more flexible in its habitat requirements, and used a broader range of vegetation types, being more of a habitat generalist. The investigation of habitat use from both a spatial and temporal perspective confirmed that both species actively selected habitat, and that the habitats they selected differed. The core areas of home ranges predominantly contained the preferred habitat for both species. In both species, core areas of home ranges of breeding individuals (where generally the nests were placed) contained preferred habitat in higher proportion than core areas of non-breeding birds. This suggests that during breeding, both species are more restricted to, and/or use more intensely the preferred habitat than when not breeding. The foraging behaviour did not differ consistently between the two species, both capturing insects mostly by snatching in canopy foliage, and also by gleaning on the vegetation, at different heights. However, the two species were already segregated by habitat. Thus the resource partitioning occurred spatially, at the macrohabitat level. In the instances when individuals of both species foraged in the same area and used the same resources, resource partitioning occurred at a temporal scale. Both species were generalists in foraging; therefore, a presumed foraging specialisation as a possible factor related to the decline of P. rufogularis was ruled out. Pachycephala rufogularis and P. inornata are unlikely to be competitors. Support for this argument came from the situation at Ngarkat, where P. inornata was absent. Despite this, P. rufogularis did not use a broader range of vegetation types in Ngarkat, as would be expected under &#8216;competitive release&#8217;. Instead the species maintained strict habitat requirements, specializing virtually on a single vegetation type. The rigid habitat requirements of P. rufogularis, together with its sedentary nature, render this species vulnerable to disturbances, such as wildfires. On the other hand, the apparent flexibility in habitat requirements and greater mobility may explain why P. inornata has been more successful than its sibling species. The information on habitat requirements, preference and use, and also on home ranges of P. rufogularis and P. inornata provided in this study should be included in future habitat suitability models and predictive models for these species, which will assist in their management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecological behaviour; declining woodland birds</field><field name="subject">Pachycephalidae.</field><field name="subject">Birds Ecology South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58580</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of a naturally oscillating triangular-jet flow.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Soon-Kong</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the structure of the flow inside a nozzle which produces a naturally oscillating jet flow. The nozzle consists of a short cylindrical chamber with a concentric triangular-inlet orifice at one end and a circular exit lip at the other end. This triangular-jet nozzle was developed from the &#8220;fluidic-precessing-jet&#8221; (FPJ) nozzle, which has a similar arrangement of components, but has a circular rather than a triangular inlet. For reliably oscillating flow, the FPJ nozzle should have an inlet-to-chamber expansion ratio of at least 5.0, a chamber lengthto- diameter ratio between 2.6 and 2.8, and an exit-lip height of about 0.1 chamber diameters. The triangular-jet nozzle produces a continuously and aperiodically oscillating jet flow which is different from the FPJ flow. The oscillation occurs at smaller inlet-to-chamber expansion ratios (2.1 &#8818; D /de&#8321; &#8818; 3.5) and over a wider range of chamber lengths (2.0 &#8818; L /D &#8818; 2.5). The initial spreading angle of the jet flow is smaller, but is still much larger than that of non-oscillating, axisymmetric turbulent-jet flows. In addition, the external &#8220;oscillating-triangular-jet&#8221; (OTJ) flow has preferred azimuthal directions which are aligned with the three corners of the orifice. The kinetic-energy-loss coefficient of the OTJ nozzle is much smaller than that of the FPJ nozzle because oscillation occurs at much smaller inlet-to-chamber expansion ratios. For a narrow range of length-to-diameter ratios (1.00 &#8818; L/D &#8818; 1.25), the triangular-inlet nozzle can also produce a non-oscillating or &#8220;stationary deflected triangular jet&#8221; (SDTJ) which reattaches asymmetrically to the inside surface of the cylindrical chamber. The SDTJ has a weak tendency to oscillate, which suggests that flow patterns required for self-excited oscillation are already present in the SDTJ flow. Surface-flow visualisation and surface-pressure measurements in the SDTJ nozzle have provided the location of critical points and bifurcation lines on the chamber wall, and from this the topology of the SDTJ flow is deduced. Some details of the flow such as a jet-reattachment node near the chamber exit and a strong swirl adjacent to the inlet orifice are known from previous studies of the FPJ flow, but there are many newly observed features. The most easily identified of these are two sink-focus separation points, one on each side of the reattachment node but closer to the inlet plane. The foci counter rotate and are of unequal size. Reverse flow through the exit plane of the chamber is attracted to the larger focus. The vortex core rising from each focus is entrained by the reattaching-jet (SDTJ) flow and is drawn out of the chamber. A backward-facing pressure probe placed in the OTJ &#8220;reattaching-flow&#8221; region of chamber wall can be used as a reliable detector of jet-flow oscillation. Cross-correlating the signal from this detector probe with simultaneous static-pressure measurements elsewhere on the chamber wall gives a conditionally-averaged pressure on the wall of the OTJ chamber. The OTJ wall-pressure distribution has the same features as the SDTJ surface-pressure distribution, but it has greater asymmetry about a mirror plane drawn through the chamber axis and the detector probe. An array of three backward-facing pressure probes has been used as an &#8220;event detector&#8221; for conditionally-sampled (PIV) measurements of non-axial velocity components in cross-sections of the OTJ nozzle. The event-detection scheme responds only to a preselected (counter-clockwise) direction of motion of the oscillating-jet flow. The streamline patterns constructed from the conditionally-sampled measurements confirm the presence of the jet-reattachment node, the swirl and the sink foci identified from the SDTJ surface-flow visualisation. The shear-layer interaction between the jet from the triangular orifice and the swirl (adjacent to the inlet plane) produces strong longitudinal vortices in the ensemble-averaged flow. The jet flow distributes these vortices through the length of the chamber. Vortex cores representing the vortices are reconstructed by tracking streamline foci from one PIV cross-section plane to another. The tracking process includes the connection and termination of vortex cores in a manner which is consistent with the Helmholtz vortex law. In this flow field, the vortex core produced by the swirl and the vortex core rising from the larger sink-focus vortex on the chamber wall are connected to form a loop. The extent to which this vortex loop is contained within the chamber determines whether or not the flow is oscillating. If only a small fraction (e.g. 8%) of the vortex circulation passes through the exit plane of the nozzle, the loop is trapped inside the chamber and the deflected jet oscillates. If the length of the chamber is halved, about 35% of vortex circulation escapes from the nozzle and the oscillation stops.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Triangular orifice; oscillating jet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58581</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of viticultural treatments on the accumulation of flavonoid compounds in grapes and their contribution to wine quality.</field><field name="creator">Cordon, Nicole</field><field name="description">The grape flavonoids include anthocyanins, tannins and flavonols, all of which contribute to grape and wine quality by influencing the colour and mouthfeel of red wine. These compounds are synthesized in different parts of the berry and during different stages of berry development. In addition, environmental and viticultural factors such as light exposure can also alter the flavonoid composition of grapes. An understanding of how synthesis of these compounds is coordinated, their relationship to wine quality and the influence of bunch light exposure on the flavonoid composition of grapes, could be used to improve fruit quality by enhanced viticultural management. The first part of this study sought to investigate the relationship between the different products of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (anthocyanins, flavonols and tannins), from two climatic regions (warm and cool) and determine their role in grape and wine quality. In collaboration with a major winery, whole Shiraz grapes were sampled at the weighbridge from a range of different vineyards from two climatic regions; warm (Riverland) and cool (McLaren Vale) in 2003 and 2004. A total of 80 grape samples were collected in each season and processed (i.e. 100 berries, separated into skin, seeds and juice, weighed and frozen). Anthocyanins and flavonols were measured, in triplicate, in skins by HPLC. Tannins were determined in the skins and seeds by two methods; phloroglucinol hydrolysis (HPLC) and protein precipitation (UV-VIS spectrophotometer). A comprehensive comparison of the two methods is discussed. In both years, the grapes from warm and cool climates formed two distinct data sets based on flavonoid composition. There was a correlation between anthocyanins and flavonols for both the warm and cool climate samples in both years, however those from the warm region had lower anthocyanin for a given level of flavonol. As expected, the level of tannin in the seeds was greater than in skin for all samples. In both years, there was a weak correlation between anthocyanin levels in the skin and skin tannins, but no relationship with seed tannins. These results suggest there is some co-ordination in the synthesis of anthocyanins, flavonols and skin tannins. Also, the two regions clearly separated based on yield and despite the weak correlations in both regions, the levels of total anthocyanins were inversely related to yield. In addition, there was no relationship with any of the flavonoids and grape quality, indicating the need for improvement in streaming fruit for quality using these flavonoid compounds. The second part of the study was to investigate the effect of bunch light exposure on flavonol synthesis and accumulation in Shiraz and Chardonnay grapes during development. Light-excluding boxes were applied to bunches at budburst. Boxes were removed at four sampling times; flowering, pre-veraison, veraison and harvest. At each sampling time, berry skins were sampled when the boxes were removed and then every second day (light induced), along with exposed controls for one week. Flavonol accumulation and flavonol synthase (VvFLS1) gene expression was determined by HPLC and Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) respectively. As expected, for all four sampling times, flavonol accumulation and VvFLS1 expression in the boxed fruit was significantly less than bunches exposed to light. On removal of boxes at flowering, pre-veraison and veraison, flavonols accumulated to levels similar to that of the exposed control fruit over a period of 4-6 days. There was a significant increase in VvFLS1 expression 2 days after exposure to light in parallel with the accumulation of flavonols. At harvest, in Chardonnay, VvFLS1 expression peaked by day 4, while in Shiraz VvFLS1 expression increased linearly and was highest at day 6. In contrast to the results for the earlier sampling times, the total amount of flavonols accumulated at harvest was less than 50% of exposed controls in Chardonnay and Shiraz grapes. These results show that flavonols are able to be induced by bunch light exposure at different times during berry development, including times when flavonols are not normally being synthesised. This suggests bunch light exposure can override the developmental control of flavonol accumulation. To further investigate the light induced expression of VvFLS1 in grapevines the molecular mechanism of transcriptional control was explored. Using genomic walking PCR techniques, two Shiraz VvFLS1 promoter sequences were cloned and their sequences were analysed. These promoter sequences were ~800bp in length and were 99% identical. A putative MYB responsive element (MRE) and several light responsive elements (LRE) were identified in the promoter region of these genes. To functionally test the VvFLS1 promoter(s), a transient assay was developed in Chardonnay suspension cells. Cells were bombarded with constructs containing potential transcription factors and the VvFLS1 promoter(s), fused to a luciferase reporter vector. After 48hrs incubation in the dark, cells were harvested and luciferase activity measured as an indicator of VvFLS1 promoter activity. Of the different transcription factors tested with the VvFLS1 promoter(s) the highest luciferase activity was observed using AtMYB12 (a flavonol-specific regulator of AtFLS1 in Arabidopsis (Mehrtens et al. 2005). While this result shows activation of the VvFLS1 promoters by AtMYB12 and the development of a transient reporter assay for testing the VvFLS1 promoter(s) a grapevine transcription factor specific for VvFLS1 was sought. Two techniques were employed to identify potential transcription factor regulators of the VvFLS1 promoter(s). The first involved BLAST sequence search analysis in a grapevine expression (EST) database with AtMYB12 and the second involved using DNA microarray technology to identify candidate transcription factors that were up-regulated in light exposed Chardonnay cell suspension cultures. Thirteen potential transcription factors were identified and after correlative RT-PCR analysis (with VvFLS1 expression patterns) two candidates were selected for further isolation and characterisation. These results have made significant progress in unravelling the molecular mechanisms of regulation of the flavonol biosynthetic, however additional experiments are required to unravel the transcriptional control of flavonol biosynthesis. This investigation contributes to our knowledge of flavonoid synthesis in grapes; how it is coordinated, the relationship with wine quality, and the influence of light particularly on synthesis of flavonols. It also explores the molecular mechanisms of VvFLS1 control, through isolation of the VvFLS1 promoter and identification of potential transcription factors, which may regulate it. An understanding of the synthesis of flavonoids and how they may be coordinated, particularly in response to light, could be used to improve fruit quality by enhanced viticultural management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; flavonoids; quality; berry development; light temperature; wine; shading; transcription factor</field><field name="subject">Flavonoids</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58582</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the nature of teacher knowledge needed and used in teaching statistics : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctorate in Education (Ed.D.) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Timothy Angus</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the knowledge needed for teaching statistics through investigations at the primary (elementary) school level. Statistics has a relatively short history in the primary school curriculum, compared with mathematics. Recent research in statistics education has prompted a worldwide move away from the teaching of statistical skills, towards a broader underpinning of statistical thinking and reasoning. New Zealand&#8217;s nationally mandated curriculum reflects this move. Consequently, little is known about the types of knowledge needed to teach statistics effectively. Ideas from two contemporary areas of research, namely teacher content knowledge in relation to mathematics, and statistical thinking, are incorporated into a new framework, for exploring knowledge for teaching statistics. The study&#8217;s methodological approach is based on Popper&#8217;s philosophy of realism, and the associated logic of learning approach for classroom research. Four primary teachers (in their second year of teaching) planned and taught a sequence of four or five lessons, which were videotaped. Following each lesson, a stimulated recall interview, using an edited video of the lesson, was conducted with the teacher. The video and interview recordings were analysed in relation to the teacher knowledge and statistical thinking framework. The results provide detailed descriptions of the components of teacher knowledge in relation to statistical thinking that are needed and used in the classroom. Included in the results are profiles of each teacher&#8217;s knowledge. These profiles describe &#8216;missed opportunities&#8217;, which were defined as classroom incidents in which teacher knowledge was needed but not used, and consequently resulted in the teachers not taking advantage of chances to enhance students&#8217; learning. A number of significant themes were revealed, linked to knowledge for teaching statistics. The themes include: problems associated with teacher listening; the need for the teacher to be familiar with the data; students&#8217; difficulties with various components of the statistical investigation cycle; and understanding variation and the development of inference. The study concludes that for effective teaching of statistics through investigations, it is necessary for teachers to have knowledge in each of four categories as related to each component of statistical thinking. If any aspect of knowledge is not available or not used, teachers will not enhance, and could disadvantage, students&#8217; learning. Implications from the findings are considered for initial and on-going teacher education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">statistics</field><field name="subject">teacher knowledge</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/534</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rotten with perfection? : an exploration of the rhetoric of knowledge in knowledge management : a thesis submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management, Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Teo-Dixon, Grace Poh Lyn</field><field name="description">Content removed from thesis due to copyright restrictions: Teo-Dixon, G. &amp; Monin, N.

He discovered two new MYB transcription factors that control the timing and spatial location of anthocyanin pigment production in flowers and leaves, giving rise to specific colour patterns. He showed that complex pigmentation patterns are formed by tightly controlling the expression of genes required to synthesise anthocyanin pigments and involves proteins that both activate genes and repress them from being expressed. The interactions between distinct classes of transcription factors form an intricate network and hierarchy, allowing fine control of gene expression and strict control of pigment production. These findings will aid in the development of ornamental plants with new pigmentation patterns and also this research serves as a model for how plants control the expression of genes to produce health-promoting plant compounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigmentation patterns</field><field name="subject">Anthocyanin regulators</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Timely/timeless : the new bespoke : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Little, Charlotte</field><field name="description">Mass-production and consumption is causing mountains of waste, overwhelming our fragile world. Since the fast fashion industry is one of the major contributors of waste, it is vital we change the way we produce, consume and market clothing in order to address concerns such as global warming. We need to consider how we can make clothing within a closed cycle to minimise waste. The garments should either be biodegradable and become nutrients for the earth, or be able to go back into the technological cycle, i.e. to be stripped of components and reused, or else up-cycled with zero waste; a cradle-to-cradle life cycle (McDonough &amp; Braungart, 2002). This project explores how a more sustainable relationship can be created between the designer, consumer and their community, in an attempt to slow the fashion industry down. Drawing upon sustainability theories I apply a new system of design, production and consumption that fosters relationships and active participation in the garment manufacturing process, as well as making clothing that is tailored for an individual&#8217;s lifestyle. In this project I have created bespoke clothing items for and with three people. The clothes are conceived as treasures that my clients can keep forever. Instead of simply being fashionable and of the time, the New Bespoke clothing is both timely and timeless. Through a series of consultations I develop an understanding of my clients personality and lifestyle, and through photographic explorations I develop a silhouette from their current wardrobe from which to design the garments. The transparency of this production system is aimed to educate my clients about environmental issues in the fashion industry, and to change their perception of the value of clothing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycled clothing</field><field name="subject">Fashion design</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410204 Crafts studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Displacement controlled behaviour of strength degraded structures</field><field name="creator">Bhamare, Rupali S</field><field name="description">This research study represents an important contribution towards fulfilling the long-term objective of the research program in terms of assessing and controlling seismic risks of building structures in low and moderate seismic regions such as Australia.

The unique structural and physiological properties of the lens are tightly integrated with highly ordered protein content to allow the lens to remain transparent. Consequently, any alteration or disturbance of these highly ordered proteins can affect the optical properties of the lens. In humans, cataracts are the major cause of blindness, yet the exact aetiology of cataract formation (cataractogenesis) is not fully understood. The purpose of the current research was to investigate whether deregulation of the Ca&#178;&#8314;-dependent enzyme, calpains, following changes in lens Ca&#178;&#8314; homeostasis, is a key mechanism leading to undesired cleavage of a number of proteins that are linked with maintaining lens transparency and contributing to cataractogenesis.  An ovine lens culture (in vitro) system and the heritable ovine cataract (in vivo) model were used to test the research hypothesis. The Ca&#178;&#8314; ionophore, ionomycin, was used to induce a Ca&#178;&#8314; overload and in vitro opacification during lens culture. Opacity in the lens was graded by a computer image analysis program. Protein profile (SDS-PAGE, 2-DE and Western detection), calpain activity (casein zymography), lens structure (microscopic view) and cytotoxicity level (LDH leakage assay) were analysed in Ca&#178;&#8314;-induced opaque lenses. The involvement of calpain during opacification was further examined by applying synthetic exogenous calpain inhibitors to the in vitro system. Two novel exogenous calpain inhibitors were also assessed for their therapeutic potential in preventing the progression of cataracts in the in vivo cataract model by topical administration of the inhibitor direct to the sheep's eye over a 11 week period. HPLC was used to detect the penetration of these compounds into ocular tissues.  Sustained Ca&#178;&#8314; influx into cultured lenses caused dense opacification. The opacity was characterised by formation of a turbid fraction and cell death in the outer cortex of the ovine lens. There was increased calpain autolysis associated with the progress of opacification, indicating increased calpain activity. Major degradation of the cytoskeletal proteins, spectrin and vimentin, was observed whilst there was limited degradation of the lens structural soluble proteins, crystallins, in response to a Ca&#178;&#8314; flux. Lens proteins were protected from degradation by adding synthetic calpain inhibitors to the culture medium. Topical administration of novel anti-calpain molecules failed to retard the progression of cataractogenesis in the ovine inherited cataract model. Further investigation of drug penetration showed that efficacy of inhibitory compounds was limited by permeability of these molecules across the cornea and the ability of the molecules to reach and penetrate into the lens.  The ovine lens Ca&#178;&#8314;-induced opacification (OLCO) model in this thesis has provided a model to understand the role of Ca&#178;&#8314; homeostasis in lens transparency. With sustained intracellular Ca&#178;&#8314; level, the degradation of cytoskeletal elements is highly correlated with calpain activity. Cataractogenesis is the pathological response to the loss of lens Ca&#178;&#8314; homeostasis in this model. The current results support the hypothesis that the deregulation of calpain activity is a trigger for a series of cascading events, leading to death of the cells in the lens.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cataractogenesis</field><field name="subject">Ca&#178;&#8314; homeostasis</field><field name="subject">proteolysis</field><field name="subject">calpain</field><field name="subject">cytoskeletal proteins</field><field name="subject">crystallins</field><field name="subject">calpain inhibitors</field><field name="subject">ovine lens</field><field name="subject">culture system</field><field name="subject">OLCO model</field><field name="subject">cell death</field><field name="subject">inheritable ovine cataract model</field><field name="subject">cataract</field><field name="subject">0601 - Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="subject">060103 - Cell Development, Proliferation and Death</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1897</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From earth's last islands: The global origins of Green politics</field><field name="creator">Dann, Christine R.</field><field name="description">Since World War Two the world has undergone a profound economic and political transformation, from an international economy and internationalist politics to a global economy and globalist politics. The Bretton Woods international financial institutions have 'structurally adjusted' Third World countries, and similar structural reforms have occurred in First World countries. The environmental consequences of globalising economic activity have been severe and also global; the social consequences of the structural reform process are equally severe. National sovereignty has been radically compromised by globalisation, and previous nationally-based initiatives to manage the activities of capital in order to mitigate its negative impacts on society and the environment, such as social democrat/labour politics, have ceded their authority to globalism. Green parties have arisen to contest the negative environmental and social consequences of the global expansion of capital, and are replacing socialist parties as a global antisystemic political force. Green politics had its origins in the world-wide 'new politics' of the New Left and the new social movements of the 1960s, and the world's first two Green parties were formed in Australia and New Zealand in 1972. A general history of the global forces which gave rise to Green politics, and a specific history of the first two Green parties, demonstrate the interplay of global and local political forces and themes, and provide an opportunity to redefine the core elements of Green politics.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Green</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">parties</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">social democracy</field><field name="subject">labour</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">society</field><field name="subject">Values Party</field><field name="subject">United Tasmania Group</field><field name="subject">160605 - Environmental Politics</field><field name="subject">160608 - New Zealand Government and Politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1905</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impacts of possum herbivory and possum control on threatened palatable species (Pittosporum patulum, Alepis flavida and Peraxilla tetrapetala) in the Lake Ohau Catchment, South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Head, Nicholas</field><field name="description">The impacts of possum herbivory were assessed on 713 individual plants of the nationally endangered Pittosporum patulum and 115 individual plants of the threatened ('Gradual Decline') mistletoes (Alepis flavida &amp; Peraxilla tetrapetala) over three years in the Temple and Huxley river valleys in the Ohau catchment, South Island New Zealand. Statistical models were used to test the influence of several explanatory variables on the probability of survival and growth rates of these rare palatable plants. Increasing defoliation levels were the most significant predictors of mortality for both P. patulum and mistletoe, and reduced growth rates in P. patulum. Mortality of P. patulum increased with plant size although smaller plants were also affected by mortality. P. patulum mortality was greater for non-forest habitats, and growth rates were greatest on warm aspects. Mistletoe mortality increased with warm aspect, steeper slopes and at lower altitudes. Plant survival and growth increased in the Temple valley following possum control. Although indicative of a positive treatment effect, other factors may have also influenced this result. Possums are the major herbivore responsible for the widespread decline of P. patulum and beech forest mistletoes throughout New Zealand, although the autecology of P. patulum predisposes it toward extinction more so than mistletoe. Monitoring in conjunction with possum control operations provide good opportunities for understanding the impacts of possums on palatable plants and ecosystems. Assessing defoliation levels on indicator species like P. patulum and mistletoes can serve as a guide for managers to assess ecosystem stress from herbivory.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brushtail possum</field><field name="subject">Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="subject">browsing</field><field name="subject">herbivory</field><field name="subject">forest composition</field><field name="subject">palatability</field><field name="subject">threatened species</field><field name="subject">Pittosporum patulum</field><field name="subject">mistletoe</field><field name="subject">Alepis flavida</field><field name="subject">Peraxilla tetrapetala</field><field name="subject">0502 - Environmental Science and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1957</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial integration of the MENA emerging stock markets</field><field name="creator">Marashdeh, Hazem Ali</field><field name="description">The main objective of this study is to examine the financial integration among four emerging stock markets in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, namely, Egypt, Turkey, Jordan and Morocco. Their interrelationships with three developed markets, the US, UK and Germany, are also examined. The motivation behind this study is that, although a lot of research has been focused on stock market integration, the emphasis has been mostly on developed markets. Stock market integration in the MENA region has not been investigated deeply enough despite the region being of a global economic and political importance. To attain this objective, the study conducts recent econometric techniques on the monthly time series of stock market price indices. It starts with testing for a unit root in the presence of structural change at an unknown time of the break, using the Innovational Outlier (IO) model. To empirically examine the financial integration, the study utilizes the newly proposed autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration. The ARDL approach has been recognized as more preferable in estimating the long-run equilibrium relationship than other cointegration approaches in small samples with mixed order process. Finally, the study explores the short and longrun dynamic relationships among these markets using Granger-causality within a correctly specified vector error correction model (VECM). The empirical results indicate that all variables show evidence of nonstationarity, even in the presence of structural change. The endogenously determined times of the breaks for all markets coincide with observed real events which affected each market. This result is consistence with the efficient market hypothesis as the nonstationarity random walk is associated with the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis. Consequently, this result emphasises that the stock markets in the MENA region are efficient.The cointegration test results show that there are long-run equilibrium relationships among all stock markets in the MENA region. This indicates that stock markets in the MENA region move together in the long-run. So, at the regional level all markets are integrated. At the same time no long-run equilibrium relationship is found between MENA markets and developed markets. This means that the MENA stock markets are segmented from developed markets. However, Egypt was the exceptional case; the study found that the stock market of Egypt has long-run equilibrium relationship with the US and UK markets.The implications of these findings are analysed at two levels, the regional and international. At the regional level, the existence if cointegration among the MENA markets implies the existence of the law of one price (LOOP). This means that the potential of regional investors for obtaining abnormal profits through portfolio diversification is limited in the long-run. The reason for this is that as the MENA stock markets are cointegrated, abnormal profits will be arbitraged away in the long-run. However, despite no arbitrage opportunities in the long-run, investors can still achieve arbitrage profits through portfolio diversification in the short-run. At the international level, the results show that stock markets in Turkey, Jordan and Morocco are not integrated with developed markets. This means that there is no long-run impact from developed stock markets towards these markets. However, a longrun relationship is found between Egypt and both US and UK when Egypt is a dependent variable. Based on these results, there are opportunities for international investors to obtain long-run gains through international portfolio diversification in stock markets of Turkey, Jordan and Morocco. Also at the same time, investors from these three countries have the opportunities to obtain long-run gains through investing in developed markets. The existence of long-run relationships between Egypt and both US and UK implies that the potential for investors from the Egyptian stock market to obtain abnormal profit through portfolio diversification in the US and UK is limited in the long-run. However, there are opportunities for achieving abnormal profit by investing in Germany as it is not cointegrated with the MENA markets. In the short-run, arbitrage opportunities and possible profits may also be achieved from diversification as the LOOP may not hold.In addition to these findings, an important contribution is made by this study. It contradicted Granger&#8217;s (1986) theory on the relationship between the existence of cointegration and market efficiency. Granger (1986) asserted that the existence of cointegration between two stock prices implies the ability to predict each price movement, which indicates market inefficiency. Also, this study does not fully agree with another stream of studies, such as Wallace (1992), Baffes (1994), Engle (1996), Ahlgren and Antell (2002) and Masih and Masih (2002) in which they asserted that cointegration does not necessarily imply market inefficiency or efficiency. However, what this study tries to bring out is that if cointegration exists between two stock markets then these markets are efficient in the long-run because the existence of cointegrated vector implies the (LOOP). Therefore, little or no arbitrage opportunities or possible benefit can be achieved from the diversification of a portfolio across markets. However, with the short-run error correction model (ECM), there could exist arbitrage opportunities and possible benefits from diversification. That is, the LOOP may not hold in the short run.The results of Granger-causality test based on the vector error correction model (VECM) reveal the existence of short-run causal relationships among the MENA markets. This means that these markets influence each other. Also, the results show that developed markets influenced stock markets in the MENA region. In the short-run, there is unidirectional Granger-causality running from stock prices in Turkey, Morocco, the US and UK to Egypt. Also, there is unidirectional Granger-causality running from Germany and the US towards Turkey. In addition, The UK and Turkey are found to Granger-cause the stock prices in Jordan. Finally, there is a unidirectional Grangercausality from Germany to Morocco.Finally, despite the empirical results show that there is a possibility of an increase in the portfolio equity flow to the MENA stock markets, the statistics of portfolio equity flow show little portfolio inflow to the region from developed countries over the period of study. Some of the reasons behind this situation are that most of these markets are still from some perspective underdeveloped, vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks and political instability in the region. Based on this, the study suggests that huge efforts should be carried on to improve the institutional reforms in these markets and increase the degree of openness for foreign capital. Also increasing the markets capitalization and adopting new technology are very crucial factors for attracting equity portfolio to the region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/543</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of nano-scaled structures, devices and materials</field><field name="creator">Cox, Barry James</field><field name="description">Problems from three specific areas of nanotechnology are examined in this thesis. Firstly, new models for nanostructures of carbon are presented. The structures of primary interest are carbon nanotubes and related nanoscale toroidal molecules of pure carbon. Following this, the mechanics of carbon nanotubes interacting with atoms and fullerenes is examined. Acted on by van derWaals forces alone, a fullerene can oscillate at high frequencies inside an open-ended carbon nanotube. The frequencies obtained are predicted to be in the gigahertz range and these so-called &#8220;gigahertz oscillators&#8221; provide the  primary motivation for this part of the thesis. Lastly, the electrostatic problem of uncharged particles at close interstice subject to an external applied electric field is explored. This is a problem of interest for a class of material called &#8220;electrorheological fluids&#8221; and various aspects of particle geometry are examined.In this thesis the conventional theory which prescribes the geometric parameters of carbon nanotubes is examined and it is found that it does not adequately account for the curvature inherent in the structure of nanotubes. By considering three postulates and then applying geometry and trigonometry, a polyhedral model is proposed and new formulae are derived which provide more precise expressions for geometric parameters such as the chiral angle, radius and unit length. Asymptotic expansions of these expressions are also shown to produce the conventional formulae as the leading order terms. Following this, approximately toroidal molecules are described which are formed from carbon nanotubes which have defects that cause a bend in an otherwise straight nanotube. The angle of the bend is determined and then expressions are derived giving the dimensions for tori formed from a number of these bend defects. Representative formulae for the ideal tori parameters, of generating radius and tube radius, are determined from integral expressions for the circumference and surface area of the ideal surface.The part of this thesis concerned with the mechanics of carbon nanotubes and fullerenes is primarily focussed on the van der Waals interactions between these types of molecules. The particular application of fullerenes oscillating inside of carbon nanotubes is examined in detail and the terms &#8220;suction energy&#8221; and &#8220;acceptance energy&#8221; are introduced here for the first time to describe the general behaviour of such systems. Following this, the equilibrium offset position for a fullerene inside of a carbon nanotube is determined as a function of the radius and the oscillatory motion is modelled using Dirac delta functions, which enables an expression for the frequency of oscillation to be given. This method is extended from spherical fullerenes to those of a spheroidal shape and then extended further to a semi-analytical method which gives the interaction between a carbon nanotube and any molecule which can be modelled as an arbitrary surface of revolution.Electrorheological (ER) fluids are a class of material which undergo a dramatic change in viscosity when an external electric field is applied. In this thesis an overview of the various theories used to model this induced force of attraction is given, including a brief outline the major mathematical results and a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods. In particular, a detailed description of the re-expansion method is given which is then used to produce solutions to three specific problems. The first problem is that of same sized particles (i.e. a monodisperse ER fluid) at close interstice and it is demonstrated that the re-expansion method provides a solution that is more congruent with experimental results than a number of other methods. Following this, the method is expanded to the problem of a bidisperse ER fluid comprising nonidentical particles. In the analysis of this solution new genuine maxima are found for various ratios of particle size, dielectric constants and particle spacing. Lastly, the method is applied to nonidentical conducting particles with dielectric coatings and a solution for this geometry is derived. Analysing this final solution in various limits also derives a useful approximation for thinly coated conducting particles.In summary, the major original contributions contained in this thesis are: a new polyhedral model for the structure of carbon nanotubes; a novel method for determining the bend angle in polyhedral nanotori and the prediction of new toroidal forms of carbon; the concepts of suction and acceptance energy and a new simple description of the mechanics of gigahertz oscillators; an innovative method to calculate the interaction energy for surfaces of revolution; the discovery of new genuine maxima in the force of attraction for bidisperse ER fluids; and, a new solution for conducting particles with dielectric coatings, which leads to an innovative approximation for thin coatings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/758</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on labour rights implementation in readymade garment (RMG) industry in Bangladesh: Bridging the gap between theory and practice</field><field name="creator">Morshed, M. Monjur</field><field name="description">The Readymade Garment (RMG) industry of Bangladesh has emerged as a competent garment producer in global garment business in recent times. This industry has successfully transformed Bangladesh into an export-oriented economy. The RMG industry also became the major foreign currency-earning sector with highest rates of absorption of industrial employment. Interestingly, women comprise more than 80 percent of the total labour force and most of them could be otherwise destitute or empty handed. In a patriarchal society like Bangladesh, the RMG industry effectively challenged the traditional view of conflating domesticity with femininity by allowing women of low-income backgrounds to move from the household to the labour market. Garment trade is regarded as a leading driver of globalisation. Though garment workers gain much by working in the garment industry the informal nature of job and adverse working conditions often threaten the livelihood possibilities of workers. This study focuses on the labour rights implementation in the RMG industry in Bangladesh. It is assumed that labour rights safeguard workers from negative consequences. It is also evident that labour rights increase labour productivity. Theoretically there are opportunities to establish labour rights in the RMG industry but in practice the picture is simply unsatisfactory. The recent labour unrest in Bangladesh is the outcome of longstanding violation of labour rights in the RMG industry. Labour rights can be ensured if Bangladesh Government can formulate and implement a comprehensive and effective labour law that incorporates labour rights in the RMG industry. The existing business model favoured multinational enterprises headquartered in developed countries and largely overlooks labourers&#8217; interests especially in developing countries. The organizations such as ILO, WTO, which are supposed to protect labourers from insecurity, vulnerability and injustice, are somehow problematic in relation to the implementation of labour rights in Least Developed countries. The RMG industry is the lifeline of Bangladesh economy and it has the potentialities to reduce poverty to a large extent by gaining increasing share in the world apparel market. Implementation of labour rights can ensure sustainable livelihood of the garment workers, which in turn enhances sustainability of the RMG industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/40</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching secondary science with data loggers: the NSW experience</field><field name="creator">Silburn, Kenneth R</field><field name="description">Many countries have identified an urgent need to revitalise the way science is taught in secondary schools in an endeavour to increase the number of students electing to study science at senior school and continuing into science-related study at university. Recent changes to the New South Wales Higher School Certificate Stage 6 Science syllabuses have resulted in a shift towards the use of data acquisition and analysis technology in the science laboratory. Combined with the increase in technology available to schools and the decrease in cost associated with its use, data acquisition equipment and analysis software, such as data loggers, are now seen as an essential part of the science curriculum. The recent introduction of data loggers into the education system has been implemented despite a lack of empirical research into their effective use. This study addresses this gap in literature by investigating the implementation and use of data loggers in the secondary science classroom from the viewpoint of both students and teachers. The purpose of the study was to describe how teachers use data acquisition and analysis technology to support student learning in secondary physics. The study also sought to develop descriptions of effective practice in the use of data loggers in secondary physics teaching and also identified the purposes of the different approaches taken by teachers. An anticipated outcome of this research is an improved understanding of how teachers can better facilitate increased student learning through the use of appropriate technology in the classroom. The study was guided by three key questions: (1) What is the current impact of data loggers in secondary school physics classrooms? (2) What factors influence the ways teachers use data loggers with their classes? (3) What are the implications for integrating data loggers into the physics curriculum? A mixed method design combining qualitative and quantitative approaches including a combination of survey, interviews and case study research methods was used. Data were collected by surveys and interviews with students and teachers, and classroom observations. Student focus group interviews were carried out under supervision of an appropriate adult, in consultation with the principal. The study incorporated the researcher&#8217;s own school as well as nine other schools in the Campbelltown and Liverpool School Districts of Sydney, New South Wales. Professional people identified as being leaders in the area of data logging and education also were interviewed to triangulate findings from the schools. The study found that despite the rhetoric exalting their virtues, the implementation of data logger use in NSW schools has not been effective. Survey results indicated that data loggers were almost only used in the senior years of high school. Even though many teachers could identify the advantages of using data loggers in their classes they were not confident in using this technology, and cited a lack of professional development, the cost and scarcity of equipment, and the complexity and problems associated with classroom management of such equipment. The study also identified cases of best practice and highlighted strategies used by teachers to use data loggers to extend students&#8217; knowledge. The findings have implications for the future implementation of data loggers in schools and suggest avenues for further research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3065</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving semiring constraint satisfaction problems</field><field name="creator">Leenen, Louise</field><field name="description">The Semiring Constraint Satisfaction Problem (SCSP) framework is a popular approach for the representation of partial constraint satisfaction problems. Considerable research has been done in solving SCSPs, but limited work has been done in building general SCSP solvers. In this thesis, we present various methods to solve SCSPs. We first consider how a SCSP might be relaxed: we relax individual constraints until an acceptable solution can be obtained. A second semiring is used to define a measure of difference between the original problem and the relaxed problem. This research was first presented at the International Workshop on Preferences and Soft Constraints at CP-2005 [40], and an extended version of the paper has been published in the Information Processing Letters journal [41].We then show how the two semirings of a relaxed SCSP can be combined into a single semiring structure. This combined semiring structure will make it possible to use existing tools for solving SCSPs to solve Combined SCSPs. This work appears in Leenen et al. [42].The remainder of this thesis focusses on algorithms to solve SCSPs. A significant amount of work has been devoted to solving the well-known maximum satisfiability problem (Max SAT) [1, 63] and the related Weighted M ax -SAT problem. This prompted us to modify the methods for solving Max-SAT, into methods for solving SCSPs. We show how to translate a SCSP into a variant of the Weighted Max &#8211;SAT Problem, which we call a Weighted Semiring Max -SAT problem, and then present a local search algorithm that is a modification of the GSAT algorithm for solving Max -SAT. This work appears in Leenen et al. [38].Finally, we extend well-known algorithms for maximal constraint satisfaction into SCSP algorithms. We present a branch and bound algorithm, a backjumping algorithm, and a forward checking algorithm. Our branch and bound algorithm performs significantly better than CONFLEX [17], a well-known fuzzy CSP solver. The branch and bound algorithm has been presented in Leenen et al. [38]. The forward checking and backjumping algorithms perform better than the branch and bound algorithm on harder problems. This work appears Leenen et al.

The first relates to the rim wall wear of the existing unlubricated steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components. Based on these findings, the second and third sections of work includes materials characterisation of alternative centre bearing surfaces - plasma nitrided molybdenum steel and stellite 6 laser clad layers, respectively. Finally, in the last section of work, the reciprocating pin-on-plate wear test method is used to evaluate the friction and wear of the existing and alternative centre bearing materials. The worn dimensions of the AISI 1053 steel, Hadfield steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components were determined. The wear of the high density polyethylene centre bowl liner was negligible. The rim wall wear of the unlubricated steel components was greatest in the longitudinal direction, whilst there was negligible wear in the lateral direction. The average wear depth rate for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was approximately twice that of the Hadfield steel centre bowl liner. The cross-sectional microhardness and microstructure of one worn AISI 1053 steel top centre and two worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners were determined. The worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners showed significant near surface work hardening. The wear mechanism for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was plastic strain accumulation in conjunction with low cycle fatigue. The quench and tempered AISI 4016 molybdenum steel samples were plasma nitrided at 450, 500, 550 and 580 &#61616;C using 75% N2: 25% H2 mixture gas for 5 hours. The microstructures of the coatings were determined using optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The treated samples were characterised using x-ray diffraction and vi microhardness. The optimum condition for this material was achieved at the temperature of 500 0C. Stellite 6 multi-track layers were laser clad onto mild and AISI 4016 steel substrates with a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser at 1800 W laser source power using four different processing speeds: 600, 900, 1200, and 1500 mm/min. The laser power, defocused laser spot size, and powder feed rate were held constant. The clad samples were characterised using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Microhardness profiles of the clad layers and heat affected zones were determined. For both substrates the optimum processing speed is between 600 and 900 mm/min. Wear testing of Hadfield pin - AISI 1053 steel plate, Hadfield pin - untreated AISI 4016 steel plate, HDPE pin &#8211; Hadfield steel plate, Hadfield pin - plasma nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate, and Hadfield pin &#8211; laser clad Stellite 6 (600 mm/min) plate material pairs was conducted using the pin-on-plate reciprocating wear test method. The wear test conditions provided a good simulation of the rim wall operating conditions for the Hadfield steel pin &#8211; plasma nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate and Hadfield steel pin &#8211; laser clad Stellite 6 (600 mm/min) plate material pairs. The Hadfield steel pin &#8211; nitrided AISI 4016 steel (500 &#176;C) plate material pair had the lowest wear under these wear test conditions, whilst it&#8217;s co-efficient of friction of 0.57 would make it suitable for use in lightly loaded (50 ton wagon mass) 3-piece freight bogies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/138</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hidden in the sands of time: geoarchaeology of sandstone landscapes in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, Australia</field><field name="creator">Ward, Ingrid A</field><field name="description">This geoarchaeological study aims to establish the geomorphic context of Aboriginal cultural landscapes and archaeological sites in the Keep River region, Northern Territory, over the Late Quaternary. The geomorphic focus of the thesis is concentrated on the sand sheets, which occur at the base of the sandstone escarpments. Sample locations include the occupation (rockshelter and sand sheet) sites of Goorurarmum, Jinmium and Karlinga, and non-occupation(creek) sites at Karlinga and Sandy Creek Gorge. The thesis presents five interrelated studies, including (i) an assessment of the theoretical relevance of geoarchaeology in northern Australia; and three studies at different timescales, evaluating (ii) long-term landscape processes over timescales of millenia using in situ osmogenic dating, (iii) sedimentary processes over timescales of centuries to millenia using luminescence dating, and sedimentary processes over decadal timescales. A fifth study integrates the results of the above four studies with existing archaeological data. Measurement of in-situ cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al concentrations from the local escarpment bedrock has revealed denudation rates of 4 - 7 mm.ka-1 over 103 &#8211; 105 year timescales, consistent with similar studies in other parts of semi-arid Australia. Calculated bedrock denudation rates were used to model burial profiles up to 6 m deep from the Jinmium sand sheet. Measured concentrations of 10Be and 26Al in two profiles, provided vertical accretion rates of ~10 - 20 mm.ka-1 over the past few hundred thousand years. Grain size, micromorphology, mineralogy and geochemistry indicate that the sand-sheet sediments are locally sourced. The rock-shelter sediments have higher relative concentrations of CaO, P205 and greater LOI, than the surrounding sand-sheet sediments, reflecting higher levels of charcoal, guano and organic matter. Post-depositional reddening of the sediments reflects groundwater variation rather than any proxy for depositional age. A total of 33 thermoluminescence (TL) and 15 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates were obtained from the rock-shelters, sand sheets and creek embankments. U- and Th-series analyses indicate relative equilibrium, with slightly higher dose rates (3.0 &#177; 0.83 Gy.ky-1) for mottled sediments than elsewhere (1.3 &#177; 0.29 Gy.ky-1). Foreshortened TL plateaux in some sand sheet sediments at Goorurarmum and Jinmium, and stepped TL plateaux in the sediments alongside Sandy Creek are indicative of episodic rapid deposition events. Basal OSL ages for the Goorurarumum rock shelter and adjacent sand sheet excavation are 0.3 &#177; 0.07 ky BP and 14.3 &#177; 0.4 ky BP respectively, and near-basal OSL ages for the Karlinga rock shelter and more distant sand sheet excavation are 18.4 &#177; 5.4 ky BP and 18.0 &#177; 0.6 ky BP respectively. The 18 ka age for the Karlinga rock shelter is uncertain, and a much younger basal radiocarbon age of ~ 4 ka is preferred. The deepest OSL ages for the Karlinga creek profile (KR99CP) and Sandy Creek Gorge profile is 8.6 &#177; 0.3 ky BP and 13.9 &#177; 0.4 ky BP respectively. An increase in the sand sheet accumulation rates from ~ 100 mm.ka-1 in the late Pleistocene to over 200 mm.ka-1 in the Holocene is interpreted to reflect enhanced monsoonal activity following postglacial marine transgression rather than human activity. The preceding results are integrated with information from radiocarbon analyses, regional archaeology, and local palaeobotanical, stone artefact and rock-art studies. Chronological results support initial evidence of seed processing, stone point production, and rock art around 3 &#8211; 4 ka. However, it is questioned whether these trends reflect &#8216;intensification&#8217; or preservation and sorting of the archaeological records. The combined chronological data from the Keep River region indicates that although there is evidence of occupation from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the majority of occupation deposits in the Keep River region are Holocene in age. However, this is biased by the greater number of rock shelter sequences sampled and by the poor preservation potential of the semi-arid monsoonal climate which favours younger sediment sequences. Better preservation of older sequences is found in open sites. The overall geoarchaelogical history describes a relatively insensitive sedimentary record of the comparatively sensitive Aboriginal occupation of the sandstone landscapes in the Keep River region.

The nub of the thesis is that despite the rhetoric in key documents &#8211; including the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia&#8217;s Biological Diversity, the NSW Biodiversity Strategy, the National Local Government Biodiversity Strategy and various plans and policies made at the municipal level &#8211; the outlook is grim without fundamental policy, legal and fiscal change. The topic is huge but crucial to any person concerned about the mammoth decline of biodiversity in Australia. Whilst being intrinsically transdisciplinary in nature, the thesis attempts to contribute to the &#8216;new production of knowledge&#8217;.&#185; It raises issues, problems, ideas and recommendations. The work is based on: &#8226; A literary search until 2001. The long gap between this date and thesis submission is due to a severe illness suffered by the author, which arose in late Dec 2001.&#178; &#8226; Empirical research into: o nine 1998/1999 &#8216;state of environment&#8217; reports prepared for by councils located roughly in or around the &#8216;NSW South-western Slopes&#8217; bioregion that is recognised for the extremely limited extent of remnant native vegetation; o conservation related clauses in all gazetted &#8216;comprehensive&#8217; Local Environmental Plans - i.e. those applying to entire Local Government areas - prepared by councils between 1995 and 2000 inclusively and which remain in force; &#8226; Personal discussion with various officials and onlookers directly involved in, or concerned about, biodiversity conservation at the municipal level. Brief summaries of each chapter are provided herein. The introduction initiates discussion on (i) the meaning of &#8216;biodiversity&#8217;, including its shift from a scientific concept to a populist expression, (ii) the position of councils in Australian government and (iii) the significance of biodiversity conservation at the local sphere. It also introduces two related concepts that are met throughout the thesis, which arguably erode council conservation capability: Local Government&#8217;s &#8216;historical and cultural baggage&#8217; and the &#8216;ratepayer ideology&#8217;. The following three chapters provide the &#8216;historical and institutional&#8217; context. Chapter Two focuses on changing societal perspectives towards the biophysical environment, together with resultant statutory and environmental trends that have paralleled the advancement of Local Government. Chapter Three traces the history of NSW Local Government, demonstrating its entrenchment in the political landscape. It examines major changes, especially functional expansion and managerial reform. Chapter Four scrutinises a particular aspect of municipal experience, namely top-down and bottom-up cooperation between neighbouring councils. This chapter adds consideration of state appointed regional bodies that may arguably sideline Local Government. The regional context is fundamental to environmental management due to the inappropriateness of many council boundaries. The next three chapters concentrate on legislative and financial detail. Chapter Five reviews the Local Government Act 1993 (NSW), which provides wide service powers, limited regulatory opportunity and special requirements for council-owned land. Chapter Six explores the land-use planning system under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW), especially the ongoing influence of its urban background. It raises the perennial influence of &#8216;developmentalism&#8217; in the determination of applications for development, which directly benefits property interests. Recent statutory change, especially in relation to &#8216;threatened species&#8217; law, may do little more than support informed habitat destruction. A closely related matter is funding, as discussed throughout Chapter Seven. The issue goes beyond insufficiency. It is argued that Local Government&#8217;s primary financial source - i.e. rating, a property tax - works against biodiversity conservation. Not only is there no policy rationale to support rating in the conservation context but the system can provide a &#8216;perverse incentive&#8217; to rural landholders to clear their lands. This problem is exacerbated by the type of valuation and differential rates. The system demands major overhaul, including consideration of increased conditional Commonwealth funding. The following two chapters relate to attitudes towards the biophysical environment that are popular amongst the general community. Chapter Eight considers the provision of vegetated, passive recreational open space whilst Chapter Nine deals with securing and enhancing local amenity. These approaches, however, can be directly inconsistent with biodiversity conservation. Parochial &#8216;green&#8217; desires of local constituents can lead to environmental damage. Notwithstanding this, Chapter Ten provides some impressive examples of Local Government supporting biodiversity conservation. But these are isolated and rely on committed individuals. Whilst the pervasive prospect throughout this thesis is one of gloom, the concluding chapter builds on previous discussion by presenting ideas and recommendations to improve the role of Local Government in conserving biodiversity. It emphasises the need for regional approaches, improved funding mechanisms and fresh visions. Councils with bigger areas, supported by community structures to maintain &#8216;grass roots&#8217; public participation, together with massive change to Local Government funding, may provide a desirable path for municipal reform and retention of Australia&#8217;s precious biodiversity. The law discussed throughout this work stands at 1 Jan 2003. Major changes since then are noted in the Postscript.&#185; See ch 1 at 2.&#178; On 31 Dec 2001, after hospitalisation for 9 days, the author was diagnosed as suffering from a malignant brain tumour, known as astrocytoma.

Three main assays are developed and presented in the thesis. The first assay explores the effect of financial ratios and other variables on corporate financial distress and identifies the probability of corporate survival in a given time frame. The four main categories of financial ratios are profitability, liquidity, leverage and activity ratios and control variables which are a market-based variable and company-specific variables; for example, company age, company size and squared size are employed in the analysis. The Cox proportional hazards model was estimated using time-varying variables based on a sample of 1,117 publicly listed Australian companies over the period 1989 to 2005. Empirical results found that financially distressed companies have higher leverage measured by debt ratio, lower past excess returns and larger size compared to active companies. Researchers argue that a company may exit the market in several different ways, such as through merger, acquisition, voluntary liquidation and bankruptcy and each type of exit is likely to be affected by different factors. Consequently, the second assay investigates the determinants of multiple states of financial distress by applying a competing risks Cox proportional hazards model. The unordered three-state financial distress model is defined as follows: state 0: active companies, state 1: distressed external administration companies and state 2: distressed takeover, merger or acquisition companies. The effect of financial ratios, market-based variable and company-specific variables including company age, company size and squared size on three different states of corporate financial distress are investigated based on a sample of 1,081 publicly listed Australian companies over the period 1989 to 2005. The results indicate that it is important to distinguish between the different financial distress states. Additionally, the results suggest that distressed external administration companies have higher leverage, lower past excess returns and a larger size while distressed takeover, merger or acquisition companies have lower leverage, higher capital utilization efficiency and a bigger size compared to active companies. In addition to examining financial ratios as the main variables, this thesis further explores the effect of corporate governance attributes on IPO companies&#8217; survival focusing on a particular sector. Accordingly, the third assay examines the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on the survival of 127 new economy IPO companies listed on the ASX between 1994 and 2002. In addition to the three main categories of corporate governance attributes include board size, board independence and ownership concentration; control variables, for example, offering characteristics, financial ratios and company-specific variables, are also included in the model. The Cox proportional hazards model estimation results found ownership concentration significantly negative related to the survival of new economy IPO companies. For offering characteristics variables, the offering size and the underwriter backing are a significant variable in explaining IPO companies&#8217; survival; however, the estimated signs are in contrast to the expectations. Specifically, those IPO companies with a larger offering size are less likely to survive than are those that offer a smaller size. Furthermore, the results found that the hazard of financial distress for companies with an offer that is underwritten is greater than the hazard for those for which the offer is not underwritten. For financial ratios, the results indicate that the debt ratio is statistically significant in explaining IPO firms&#8217; survival. In particular, IPO companies with a low total debts to total assets ratio are less likely to fail.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/401</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rapid adaptive programming using image data</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Alexander</field><field name="description">This work was initiated to address the problem of automated weld repair in a specific application; namely hydro turbine cavitation damage. An extensive review of the application requirements was undertaken and this highlighted the need for a new approach to robot programming. This thesis therefore focused on the development of a novel rapid programming technique based on a vision system. The implementation involved the development of algorithms to correlate robot and vision system coordinates, communication links to the system hardware, and a software environment to &#8216;manage&#8217; the process. The complete system was successfully validated by representative trials on a full-size hydro turbine mock-up. Several investigations examining different industrial applications such as the weld repair of hydro turbine runners in the power generation industry and weld repair of crawler shoes in the mining sector have demonstrated the feasibility of using robot technology. However, limitations have been identified in these investigations that continue to impede the widespread acceptance and use of this technology in industry. An offline programming technique was developed in this thesis that addresses some of these limitations, and seeks to improve confidence in robotic systems for &#8216;one-off&#8217; or small batch run applications. OH&amp;S regulations were found to be the significant driver in developing systems for insitu repair by robot. Small commercial robots are available that partially satisfy the requirements for in-situ use; however, a fast means of robot programming and the ability to handle uniquely damaged shapes at arbitrary locations remains unsolved. These have been appropriately addressed in the current work with the development of an automatic adaptive system capable of rapid robot programming and online process control via an intuitive, user-friendly PC-based interface. Various sensor technologies and profilometry tools and techniques were reviewed. Based on simplicity, cost, and availability, the most promising approaches identified were touch-sensing or non-laser-based vision for profilometry, followed by offline robot programming based on the acquired data. In this thesis, image acquisition was achieved using a low-cost CCD camera, damaged areas were identified, and weld paths automatically generated. A combined and integrated profilometry and offline programming technique was devised in conjunction with a robotic system incorporating touch-sensing. The speed of the system developed in this thesis enables positional repair welds of unique shape to commence within minutes, making the prospect of &#8216;one-off&#8217; repairs commercially viable. The technique developed is suitable for the target application; hydro turbine cavitation repair, but can be easily extended to many other wear replacement scenarios commonly found in industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/422</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of advanced electrode materials for use in rechargeable lithium batteries</field><field name="creator">Needham, Scott Andrew</field><field name="description">Batteries are a necessary companion to most portable electronic devices, and the rechargeable lithium battery is the most energy dense and lightest of all the competing battery types. These features make it the most likely battery to be used in future electronic devices, which will be smaller and have increased functionality. Therefore, the performance of the rechargeable lithium battery must continue to be improved in terms of capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. This thesis contributes to this goal by developing new materials and novel synthesis techniques for application in advanced rechargeable lithium batteries.A significant contribution to the ever-growing collection of works on the doping of LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 structures in an attempt to raise their practical storage capacities is presented. The practical capacity of these materials can sometimes be increased by aliovalent doping due to the formation of charge-carrying holes, which impart a higher electrical conductivity. In the case of LiCoO2 doped with Mg, V and Mo prepared by traditional solid-state methods, the lithium storage capacity was not improved compared to the un-doped LiCoO2. This was attributed to the formation of lithium-containing secondary phases, which resulted in a lithium deficient primary phase and a higher concentration of Jahn-Teller Co4+ ions. These effects disrupted the intercalation framework and produced a poor electrochemical performance. In contrast, work on the doping of titanium into LiFePO4 confirmed that a complete solid solution could be formed using a sol-gel method, despite several previous works suggesting that the aliovalent doping of this structure was impossible. Doping 1 mol% titanium into the LiFePO4 structure improved the capacity to only 5 % less than the theoretical maximum attainable capacity. The mechanism for this improvement was related to increased p-type semiconductivity in the material.A novel materials synthesis technique, electric discharge assisted mechanical milling (EDAMM), was applied for the first time to the preparation of functional oxides. LiCoO2 and LiFePO4 cathode materials and SrTixCo1-xO3 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5), which has possible magnetic applications, were synthesized in a matter of minutes with either microsized or nanosized powder morphologies. The electrochemical performance of the cathode materials was shown to be comparable to those delivered by powders synthesized by traditional solidstate techniques. SrTixCo1-xO3 powders could be formed as complete solid solutions with interesting magnetic properties. The EDAMM method shows commercial potential, as it can synthesize a wide range of functional oxide powders in high quantities. Concerning the synthesis of novel materials, this work also reports on the first ever formation of uniform and aligned NiO nanotubes. The nanotubes were up to 60 &#956;m long, had an outer diameter of 200 nm and a wall thickness of 20-30 nm. Compared to nanocrystalline NiO, the nanotubes delivered a 30 % increase in the discharge capacity after repeated cycling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggests that this improvement was due to kinetic advantages.Finally, unique carbon-based SnSb and transition metal oxide nanocomposite materials formed by various chemical techniques are shown to offer promise as anode materials due to their high capacity and excellent cycle life. The use of SnSb alloys has previously been hindered by their poor cyclability, which is caused by volume changes during cycling that result in a loss of electrical contact. Physically mixing carbon in a 1:1 weight ratio with the active material does not improve the cyclability of the electrode, but improves the realized capacity by increasing the electrical conductivity. A superior method of utilizing carbon in a composite form is to synthesize a SnSb-CNT powder, in which the SnSb is chemically bonded onto the carbon nanotube (CNT) nano-network. These powders demonstrated a high reversible capacity and stable cyclability. This method is an effective and promising option to address the problem of volume changes in all high capacity alloys. The Co3O4&#8211;C composite powders were produced by spray pyrolysis of a sugar-metal ion solution. The capacity in cells was &gt; 800 mAh g-1 for over 50 cycles, which solved the capacity fade problems. The improved electrochemical properties were related to the presence of a carbon sheath formed during processing, which acted to prevent excessive electrolyte reduction and retard the development of a thick solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). A disordered C matrix was also formed throughout the bulk powder during processing, which assisted in cushioning the volume changes associated with the electrochemical reaction.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/696</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that motivate or demotivate young people with sexually abusive behaviours and their families to seek help: a social marketing perspective</field><field name="creator">Bagot, Janice</field><field name="description">Child sexual abuse is a widespread social problem in Australia and across the world. Young people perpetuate a significant proportion of this abuse and many convicted adult paedophiles begin sexually abusive behaviours in their adolescence. One public health strategy to reduce juvenile sexual offending is to increase the numbers of young people receiving assessment and treatment services to address their behaviour. This requires parents to seek help and access services for their child. In order to be able to &#8216;market&#8217; help, this study has aimed to add to the slim body of knowledge about factors that motivate and demotivate young people with sexually abusive behaviours and their families to seek help and utilise treatment services.The theory of planned behaviour and a social marketing framework were used to inform semi-structured interviews conducted with NSW experts in juvenile sexual offending. The study explores expert opinions about the attitudes, social acceptance, perceived ease or difficulty, benefits and costs that young people and their families experience towards seeking help, including the utilisation of treatment services. Results indicate that young people with sexually abusive behaviours towards children are unlikely to seek help before others detect their behaviour. Factors that contribute to a lack of intention to seek help include:(a)	unfavourable attitudes towards seeking help prior to their behaviour being detected (b)	social stigma associated with sexually abusing children and weak social norms around offenders seeking help for their behaviour (c)	lower perceived behavioural control towards seeking help (d)	high perceived costs and low benefits associated with disclosing their behaviour.This study finds that the most common pathway for young people to receive treatment services in NSW is through the voluntary disclosure of the abuse by young victims and the notification of suspected child sexual assault to statutory child protection agencies by mandatory reporters, and a subsequent investigation and referral. Once their behaviour is detected, young people often display more favourable attitudes towards attending treatment services and experience a range of benefits from attending quality treatment provision. This study finds that young people are generally reliant on their parent(s) to be able to access and attend treatment services.A key finding of this study is that many parents are motivated to (and do) take action to address their child&#8217;s sexually abusive behaviour. Concern about their role as parents and family wellbeing are identified as central drivers for parents who try to keep the crisis within the family or reach out to informal or formal sources of help. However, the study reveals a number of demotivating factors towards help-seeking, such as: (a)	psychological distress and defences once parents become aware of their child&#8217;s behaviour (b)	a lack of knowledge about sexual abuse and where to get help (c)	social stigma (d)	unfavourable attitudes at involving external agencies in their family.   Parents can experience a range of benefits if they are able to access and complete effective therapeutic intervention for their child, particularly if this involves the family. Factors that help enable families to utilise treatment services include pressure, support and consequences from statutory authorities and structural factors, such as available, affordable and accessible treatment services.However, a current lack of expertise and skill by service providers and a dearth of affordable and available services, as identified in this study, can leave families frustrated, dissatisfied and reluctant to seek further help. This study highlights the need and opportunity to develop a range of social marketing-based interventions to increase the numbers of parents seeking and receiving help to address their child&#8217;s behaviour. Before help is marketed to families in NSW, however, more high quality, affordable and accessible services are needed to meet both current and future demand. The study recommends that the benefits of treatment services and mandatory reporting be promoted to government policymakers, politicians and funding providers, as well as to statutory child protection agencies working directly with young people and their families.  The study also recommends that social marketing strategies to increase the incidence of parents seeking formal help for their child address: (a)	unfavourable attitudes towards seeking help from formal sources, such as statutory child protection services (b)	low community acceptance and stigma associated with help-seeking for perpetrators of child sexual assault (c)	the perception (and actuality) that it is hard for families to seek help and access treatment services in NSW.This study finds that statutory services play a key role supporting and encouraging parents to seek help for their child. Increasing the favourable attitudes of caseworkers towards treatment and reducing organisational barriers may enable parents to persist with help-seeking. The study also recommends using targeted public campaigns to increase the social acceptability of help-seeking for sexually abusive behaviours. Social marketing-based strategies are also recommended to: (a)	increase the disclosure of sexual abuse by victims (b)	increase identification of abusive behaviours and where to get help for  families of young people &#8216;at risk&#8217; of sexual offending and families in general  (c)	align the product of &#8216;treatment&#8217; with parental desires and motivations.Further research, conducted directly with young people and families, is needed to more accurately gauge their attitudes, perceived benefits and costs and ease or difficulty in seeking help. This customer-focused research would inform any social marketing-based interventions to increase help-seeking behaviour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/799</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of urbanisation on the superb fairy-wren (malurus cyaneus)</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Holly Maree</field><field name="description">The process of urbanisation is altering much of the world&#8217;s natural habitats, resulting in landscapes vastly different from those they replace. However, the urban matrix is not devoid of wildlife. In fact, its capacity to support a wide diversity of fauna is becoming increasingly valued. Urbanisation changes the patterns of resources and habitat structure, creating mosaics of optimal and sub-optimal patches. Therefore we would expect to see changes in the behaviour and ecology of species living in urban habitats. The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus) is a small insectivorous bird species whose response to urbanisation is unclear. It has been shown to prefer the edges of remnant habitat, particularly in weed-infested areas, yet is patchy in its distribution in urban landscapes, and thought to be in decline there. In this thesis I have examined how (a) vegetation characteristics, (b) territory size, (c) behaviour, including foraging and (d) food availability differ by living in urban habitats compared to rural/remnant habitats. Superb fairy-wrens showed a preference for suburban landscapes with shrubs, usually native, and avoided suburban locations without them. In both rural/remnant edge habitat and suburban habitat they were also associated with the introduced weed lantana (Lantana camara). It is likely that this shrub provides important shelter, especially in the absence of native vegetation that provides equivalent structure. Radio-tracking of female superb fairy-wrens revealed that territories in suburban locations were, on average, half the size of territories in rural/remnant habitats when calculated using the minimum convex polygon method. Calculations made with the fixed kernel method indicated that there was no difference in territory size. This difference in size calculated by different methods suggests that superb fairy&#172; wrens utilise more of the vegetation within suburban territories and avoid larger areas of unsuitable habitat in rural/remnant edge locations. The sizes of both the suburban and rural/remnant habitats were similar to that in higher quality fragmented habitats, as calculated by previous studies. Regardless of the location of their territories, superb fairy-wrens foraged largely on the ground but spent the most of their time, on average, in shrubs. Males spent significantly longer foraging in suburban locations than rural/remnant habitat, with females showing the same, but non-significant trend. This increase in foraging time was not taken at the expense of other behaviours however and appeared to be due to the size of food items in suburban territories. The biomass of individual arthropods was smaller in suburban locations than rural/remnant territories but the total biomass per site was the same, largely due to the greater abundance of orthopterans in rural/remnant areas. This suggests that superb fairy-wrens foraged for longer in suburban territories to obtain equivalent intake to that in rural/remnant territories. Suburban areas without superb fairy-wrens did not have a lower biomass of arthropods than suburban fairy-wren territories and therefore it is unlikely that birds in suburban habitats were selecting their territories based on food availability. Superb fairy-wrens instead appear restricted in their distribution in urban habitats due to a shortage of suitable vegetation, primarily comprised of the shrub layer. While there were changes to food resources, the flexible behaviour of this species with urbanisation allows it to modify its foraging behaviour to compensate for this difference. We do not know the long term consequences faced by individuals occupying the urban landscape, but it appears that that these two habitats, with varying degrees of urban impact, provide suitable habitat for this species to persist.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/821</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new approach in determining the load transfer mechanism in fully grouted bolts</field><field name="creator">Jalalifar, Hossein</field><field name="description">Rock bolts are used as temporary and permanent support systems in tunnelling and mining operations. In surface mining they are used for slope stability operations and in underground workings to develop roadway, sink shafts, and stoping operations. Rock bolting technology has developed rapidly over the past three decades due to a better understanding of load transfer mechanisms and advances made in the bolt system technology. Bolts are placed into discontinuous rock to prevent movement between the discontinuity planes, depending on the direction of installation and nature of the discontinuity surfaces. Rock bolting can increase the tension and shear properties of the rock mass.Nowadays, the application of rock bolts for ground reinforcement and stabilisation is worldwide, but its effectiveness depends on rock type, strata lithology, and encapsulation characteristics. Thus the bolt, rock interaction, particularly near the shear joints, and how a bolt reacts to surrounding conditions require continuous evaluation and research. Work provides an in depth study of the bolt, grout, concrete interaction during under axial and lateral loading.To better understand load transfer characterisation bolt shearing across joint and planes, this research programme consists of three parts. Accordingly, a series of experimental studies and field work was undertaken. A numerical technique was developed to obtain the stress and strain developed along the bolt and surrounding materials under axial and lateral loading. Finally, a field investigation programme was undertaken to obtain the load developed along different bolt profiles (another objective of this thesis). Bolt profiles were also investigated by laboratory studies.A double shearing system (DSS) was used to examine bolts shearing. Testing was undertaken in 20, 40, and 100 MPa strength concrete to simulate different rock strengths. Only three bolt types were used in axial loading tests and different thicknesses of resin were evaluated under axial and lateral loading. Tests subjected to lateral loading were undertaken in 0, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 80 kN pre-tension loads, which revealed that the strength of the concrete significantly affects the bolt &#8211; joint contribution. Also shear displacement was dramatically reduced when the strength of the concrete was increased. Pre-tension increases the shear resistance of the system. The profile of a rock bolt affects the shear performance and load transfer under axial and lateral loads.The 3-D FE code, ANSYS V. 9.1 was used. To investigate the load transfer and interaction between bolt, grout, and concrete under non-linear conditions, special element types for the materials and contact interfaces were introduced. The stress and strain built up along the materials under axial and lateral loads was examined. A laboratory study on shearing at the bolt, resin interface of fully grouted bolts was extended to field studies in Appin and Metropolitan Collieries in the Southern Coalfields of the Sydney Basin, NSW, Australia. Twelve instrumented bolts were installed at both mines. Both installation sites were in the heading of a retreating long wall mine. The field investigation revealed that the load transfer on a bolt is affected by horizontal in-situ stresses and profile of the bolt surface. It showed that bolt with higher ribs and wider spacing offered greater shear resistance at the bolt &#8211; resin interface, which agreed with the laboratory results.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/855</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some mathematical models arising in nano- and bio-technology</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yue</field><field name="description">In this thesis, three mechanical models arising from nanoscale and biological systems are investigated, namely the dynamics of various nanostructures, the axial buckling of carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods, and the worm-like chain model for stretched semi-flexible molecules and the utilization of such a model for investigating molecular stretching in the connective tissue extracellular matrix.In nanomechanics, we investigate the motion of both a carbon atom inside a carbon nanotube and a C60 fullerene inside a carbon nanotube. We assume a continuous model for which the atoms are assumed to be smeared across the surface of the molecule, so that the pairwise molecular energy can be approximated by performing surface integrals. The spiral path of the atom is found to be stable, but the spiral path of the C60 fullerene is shown to only exist for a few pico seconds. Next, we investigate the motion of a nano tippe top spinning on the interior of a single-walled carbon nanotube in the presence of a variable magnetic field. Unlike the classical tippe top, the nanoscale tippe top does not flip over since the gravitational effect is insignificant at the nanoscale. After the precession, if we apply an opposite retarding magnetic force at the contact point, then the molecule will return to its original standing up position. We next investigate some nanoscale orbiting systems, and in particular, we study an atom and a C60 fullerene orbiting around a single infinitely long carbon nanotube and a C60 fullerene orbiting around a C1500 fullerene. We find that the circular orbiting frequencies of the proposed nano systems are in the gigahertz range and the classification of their orbiting paths are determined numerically.For the axial buckling of carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods, we investigate the buckling behavior of doubly clamped multi-walled carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods as nano-electromechanical systems. We incorporate the bending curvature of the tube into the elastic energy and determine the nanotube&#8217;s maximum displacement for all bending regimes. We find that while the approximate solution (without curvature) underestimates the maximum displacement of the buckled carbon nanotube in the weak bending regime, our numerical solution provides an entirely different prediction in comparison to the approximate solution in the strong bending regime. Furthermore, we derive an instability condition for multi-walled carbon nanotubes and nanopeapods under an axial load by taking into account the van der Waals forces between molecules. We observe that the critical force derived from the axial buckling stability criterion decreases as a result of the molecular interactions between adjacent layers of the nanotubes and the molecular interactions between the embedded fullerenes and the inner carbon nanotube. The worm-like chain model arises as a model for stretched semi-flexible molecules and for its applications to molecular stretching in the extracellular matrix, we adopt a variational principle to examine the model and then we utilize the model to describe anionic glycosaminoglycan between collagens. The worm-like chain model has been proposed assuming that each monomer resists the bending force. We determine a force-extension formula for the worm-like chain model analytically, and find that our formula suggests new terms such as the free energy and the cut-off force for a molecule. In addition, we predict two possible phase changes for a stretched molecule, and show theoretically that a molecule must undergo two phase changes when they are stretched beyond their total contour lengths. Furthermore, we adopt the worm-like chain model to describe the mechanical properties of a collagen pair in the connective tissue extracellular matrix. We find that the growth of fibrils is intimately related to the maximum length of the anionic glycosaminoglycan and the relative displacement of two adjacent fibrils.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3075</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The forgotten forests : the environmental regulation of forestry on private land in New South Wales between 1997 and 2002</field><field name="creator">Prest, James</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the regulation of private native forestry in two Australian jurisdictions: NSW and Tasmania. Private forests have long been the forgotten forests - a neglected aspect of forest policy in Australia. Appropriate supervision of private native forestry (PNF) is important because private forests are home to much threatened biodiversity, and as they make up a significant proportion of the total area of native forests in NSW. PNF also makes a substantial contribution to total timber production in NSW. Research was conducted into the administration of environmental laws applying to PNF in NSW between 1997-2002 in order to assess the regulatory framework and to discern patterns of administrative behaviour. The thesis asked &#8220;Were NSW environmental laws applying to PNF effectively implemented and enforced?&#8221; The hypothesis that much PNF in NSW is &#8220;under-regulated&#8221; in practice was explored. To examine these questions, a thorough review of all relevant legislative provisions and case law was conducted. The Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1997 and the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 and their implementation in relation to PNF were examined in particular. Defects in the legislative framework applying during the study period were revealed. The applicable law was found to be complex, and highly fragmented, with responsibility spread across many agencies. Over 100 interviews with agency staff at head office and regional offices were undertaken. Other information was obtained from internal documents and through requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The broader context was addressed by reviewing theoretical literature in environmental law, with an emphasis on the regulatory theory literature. Some regulatory failures stemmed from inadequate implementation of the legislation. It was found that PNF was infrequently regulated under the Native Vegetation Conservation Act, primarily due to a problematic exemption for specified types of PNF. In the North Coast and Hunter regions the exemption was claimed by 100% of PNF operations (on land tenures where it was available). PNF was found to be infrequently regulated by local government under Local Environment Plans (64.5% of 107 local governments did not regulate PNF in the main rural zone). The safety net mechanism of licensing under the Threatened Species Conservation Act was infrequently applied with only five licences granted for PNF. Regarding law enforcement, a low level of prosecution activity was found to have taken place. The findings support the proposition that in practice NSW law was inadequate to ensure ecologically sustainable forest management, due to the poorly designed and integrated statutory framework. They also provide some evidence to support the proposition that the applicable laws were generally implemented with a light touch, generally expressing a laissez faire approach to PNF in most regions (with some exceptions). These findings suggest there is a pressing need for reform of the regulatory framework in NSW, if standards of ESFM are to be achieved. Thus any future exemptions must be of narrow application. Further, a more pro-active approach to ensuring compliance with legislative requirements is necessary. While the results suggest regulatory failure, they do not constitute grounds for wholesale replacement of regulation with other mechanisms such as self-regulation and incentives payments. Issues of compliance and enforcement as well as adequacy of funding are crucial to choices of policy instrument for biodiversity conservation on private land.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/413</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quaternary palaeochannel evolution and groundwater movement in the Coleambally Irrigation District of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Pucillo, Kevin</field><field name="description">The Quaternary alluvial and aeolian sediments underlying the eastern portion of the Riverine Plain have been examined to assess their impact on groundwater access and movement in the Coleambally district. Over 9800 borehole logs from the Coleambally Irrigation Area (CIA) and surrounding districts were digitized using GIS and database software and supplemented with 632 borehole logs from the Department of Land and Water Conservation (Leeton) to form the platform for stratigraphic and groundwater investigations conducted in this study. The borehole data were summarised into two sediment classification schemes, the first to delineate the distribution of palaeochannel sediments and the second to assess to spatial distribution of aquitards and aquifers. A series of detailed cross-sections differentiated between at least four distinct palaeochannel sequences identified within the Upper Shepparton Formation overlying the clay-dominated Lower Shepparton Formation. The two deepest sequences, the new Gumblebogie and Ugobit members, comprise thick (3-10 m), laterally extensive (up to 25 km wide) sheets of coarse sandy alluvium that occur to the north of the CIA at depths between 12 to 35 metres below the surface. These deposits are evidence of highly active alluvial phases on the plain, more vigorous than any since. Slightly higher in the sequence (typically 10-20 m depth) is a thick (2-15 m), laterally extensive (up to 10 km wide) mixed-load sequence (the new Duderbang member), which is stratigraphically disconnected from the deeper sanddominated units. Near-surface palaeochannel deposits, which consist of less extensive (up to 3 km wide) coarse sandy alluvium at depth and a combination of mixed- and bedload sequences closer to the surface, make up the youngest palaeochannel deposits in the area. The size and extent of reserved palaeochannel sequences beneath the study area have decreased markedly since what is interpreted as the mid Quaternary and is probably symptomatic of declining fluvial activity on the Riverine Plain through to the present. The development of source-bordering dunes associated with belts of palaeochannel material in the area was examined using shallow geophysics (GPR), topographic surveys, laser particle size analysis and thermoluminescence dating. Dune building in Contents the area occurred in conjunction with channel activity during the Kerarbury (55-35 ka) and Coleambally (105-80 ka) palaeochannel phases (Page et al., 1996) when sediment supply conditions were favourable, probably due to strongly seasonal discharges draining the southeastern highlands. The presence of stabilising vegetation on the channel margins is believed to have played a key role in the development of dunes in the area, which show poorly developed internal structure. The increased precipitation that enhanced channel discharges must also have sustained dune vegetation. Increased aridity and reduced vegetation approaching and during the LGM appears to have caused the widespread remobilization of dune crests. The complex alluvial and aeolian stratigraphy of the Shepparton Formation strongly influences groundwater movement in the Coleambally district. Piezometric levels show that deeper, highly permeable units (e.g. Ugobit member) in the northern part of the study area act as conduits for the discharge of groundwater, helping to maintain much lower watertables in the north as well as induce groundwater flow from the CIA. &#8216;Sediment vs depth&#8217; analysis demonstrates that there is limited vertical connection through the thick, clay-dominated sequence of the Lower Shepparton Formation to the highly transmissive sands and gravels of the underlying Calivil Formation. The tendency of the Lower Shepparton Formation to restrict downward leakage is likely to both contribute to the problem of shallow irrigation-induced watertables in the CIA as well as impede efforts to lower watertables by pumping from deeper aquifers. The upper 3 metres of the Shepparton Formation are clay-dominated with a low water storage capacity, causing near-surface watertables to be highly responsive to recharge by surface water. The available data indicate that when piezometric levels fall below this clay-rich zone they are able to absorb short-term increases in recharge due to the higher proportion permeable alluvium in the unsaturated zone.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/406</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurturing the inner lives of children: an exploration of children's spirituality in three educational settings</field><field name="creator">Nemme, Kori</field><field name="description">Using the theoretical framework of Howard Gardner (1999) and David Hay and Rebecca Nye (2006) this qualitative inquiry aimed to identify and describe children&#8217;s day-to-day experiences of spirituality in a range of social settings. In the context of this study spirituality was described in terms of meaning and connectedness and as a means to direct and give value to an individual&#8217;s actions and beliefs.Case studies were employed at the early childhood, primary and lower high school settings to gain an understanding of spirituality across childhood. The research focused upon the classroom context and other social situations, investigating both formal teaching of spirituality and children&#8217;s informal interaction and exploration of spiritual matters. Data collection methods were primarily based upon observation but also included interviews, work samples and journal entries.The research involved two phases of data collection. In the course of Phase one, each of the research sites were visited for one day per week across eight weeks, whereby data collection focused on the whole class situation and on all consenting participants. After the eight weeks, data continued to be collected on all participants yet focused more specifically on six case-study children selected purposely for more detailed study.This thesis extends the classic work in the area by Gardner (1999) and Hay and Nye (2006) by illustrating what four spiritual sensing categories &#8211; State of being: Awareness-sensing, State of being: Mystery-sensing, Concern for existential issues: Mystery-sensing, and Concern for existential issues: Values-sensing &#8211; surfaced as in the day-to-day lives of children in secular educational settings and other social environments. What also emerged through the case studies was the existence of various factors that supported children&#8217;s engagement with their spirituality. Differences were identified regarding the approach of families and the educational settings, however, the influences of the media, sports, peers, and religious teachings were also recognised. In particular, spirituality was addressed differently at the three educational settings in terms of the teacher&#8217;s influence, school curriculum, and physical environment. Variance among these elements impacted the ways in which children could express their spirituality at school, thus affirming the important contribution that public school education can make towards young people's spiritual development.As the result of this investigation, this present study suggested several recommendations for nurturing children&#8217;s spirituality at their home settings and in secular educational settings. These included: recognising children&#8217;s spirituality as an integral aspect of the child&#8217;s development; the provision of adequate time; demonstrating an open and approachable manner; awareness to spiritual dialogue and nonverbal communication; facilitating and addressing spiritual questions; creating belonging and community; encouraging self-reflection; demonstrating role-modeling behaviours and attitudes; attending to informal moments; awareness of expectation; creation of space and environment; and, supplying resources and experiences for engagement with the spiritual domain. Several factors were also identified specific to facilitating spirituality at educational settings. These included, building teacher-student relationships to develop awareness of the context in which children are located and employing spirituality as both an entry point and subject matter to engage learning. The recommendations also indicated the need for further policy development based upon empirical work, integrating the understanding of children&#8217;s spirituality into teacher training courses, and, future research which extends the spiritual framework of this inquiry to other populations of children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/651</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pesticide exposure in free-living native birds and the effects of acute dosing of fenitrothion and fipronil on physiological performance in selected species</field><field name="creator">Fildes, Karen J</field><field name="description">This chapter introduces the main classes of pesticides with a brief overview of their mode of toxic action. Cholinesterase inhibiting chemicals and their known effects on birds are reviewed in detail. The benefits and limitations of the use of lethal compared to sublethal toxicological endpoints to assess pesticide impacts on avian species in toxicological research are discussed. It is argued that there is a critical need for investigations of sublethal effects to consider biochemical and physiological components of ecologically relevant traits. The use of pesticides for locust control, particularly fenitrothion and fipronil, by the Australian Plague Locust Commission, is discussed. The chemical properties and mode of toxic action of these two pesticides are reviewed and the potential impact of their application on Australian native bird species is assessed.Chapter 2 Cholinesterase (ChE) inhibiting pesticides are applied throughout Australia to control agricultural pests. Blood plasma ChE activity is a sensitive indicator of exposure to organophosphorus insecticides in vertebrates. To aid biomonitoring and provide reference data for wildlife pesticide-risk assessment, plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities were characterised in nine native bird species: brown songlarks (Cinclorhamphus cruralis), budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), clamorous reed warblers (Acrocephalus stentoreus), double-barred finches (Taeniopygia bichenovii), king quails (Coturnix chinensis), Richard&#8217;s pipits (Anthus novaeseelandiae), white-plumed honeyeaters (Lichenostomas penicillatus), willie wagtails (Rhipidura leucophrys) and yellow throated miners (Manorina flavigula). The plasma of all species contained AChE and BChE except in king quail where no AChE was present. The lowest detectable plasma AChE activity was 0.10 &#61549;mols/min/ml in budgerigars and the highest was 0.86 &#61549;mols/min/ml in clamorous reed-warblers. BChE activity in the plasma ranged from 0.37 in double-barred finches to 0.90 &#61549;mols/min/ml in white-plumed honeyeaters and clamorous reed-warblers. The lowest proportion of AChE was found in budgerigars (12.8%) and highest in willie-wagtails (67.8%). Apart from king quail AChE activities in all species were within the range reported for other avian species. The absence of AChE in king quail has not previously been reported for any bird species. The effect of sampling time on plasma ChE was assessed in budgerigars and zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and seasonal effects were examined in zebra finches.  No diurnal variation in ChE activity was found at any time of day in either species although there was a significant difference in all ChE activity between seasons in zebra finches.Chapter 3 Huge aggregations of flightless locust nymphs pose a serious threat to agriculture when they reach plague proportions, but provide a very visible and nutritious resource for native birds. Locust outbreaks occur in spring and summer months in semiarid regions of Australia. Fenitrothion, an organophosphate pesticide, is aerially sprayed to control locust plagues. To evaluate fenitrothion exposure in birds attending locust outbreaks, we measured total plasma cholinesterase (ChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in four avian species captured pre- and post-fenitrothion application and ChE reactivation in birds caught post spray only. Eleven of 21 plasma samples from four species had ChE activity below the diagnostic threshold (two standard deviations below the mean ChE activity of pre-spray samples). Granivorous zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) and insectivorous white-winged trillers (Lalage sueurii) had significantly lower mean plasma total ChE, BChE, and AChE activity post-spray, while two other insectivores, white-browed (Artamus superciliosus) and masked woodswallows (Artamus personatus), did not. Cholinesterase was reactivated in 19 of the 73 plasma samples collected, and in one of three brain samples. We conclude that native bird species are exposed to fenitrothion during locust control operations. This exposure could have detrimental impacts as locust outbreaks and avian reproductive events are both stimulated by heavy summer rainfall, leading to co-occurrence of locust-control and avian breeding activities.Chapter 4 The effect of fenitrothion exposure on birds was examined by measuring aerobic metabolism, blood haemoglobin (Hb) content, plasma cholinesterase activities and body mass for up to 21 d post-dose. Peak metabolic rate (PMR) was measured in a flight metabolic chamber in three dose groups of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) (100 mg/kg = high, 60 mg/kg = medium, 30 mg/kg = low), and one dose group each of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) (3 mg/kg) and king quails (Coturnix chinensis) (26 mg/kg). Aerobic metabolism was measured during a 1 h exposure to sub-freezing thermal conditions in low dose house sparrows and king quails (26 mg/kg). Fenitrothion had no effect on metabolic rate during cold exposure or on Hb at any time. By contrast, aerobic performance during exercise in sparrows was reduced by 58% (high), by 18% (medium), and by 20% (low) 2 d post dose. House sparrows (high) had the longest recovery period for PMR (21 d) and plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activity (14 d). House sparrows (high) and treated king quails had significantly lower body weight at 48 h post-dose whereas body mass was invariant in zebra finches and house sparrows (medium and low). Cholinesterase was maximally inhibited at 6 h post dose, and had recovered within 24 h, in house sparrows (low), king quails and zebra finches. Exercise PMR in zebra finches and king quails was reduced by 23% at 2 and 3 d post-dose, respectively, despite these birds being asymptomatic in both behaviour and plasma ChE activities. Chapter 5 We examined the sublethal effects of the fipronil based pesticide Adonis 3UL &#174; insecticide on birds by measuring exercise induced peak metabolic rate (PMR) in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and king quail (Coturnix chinensis), and during a 1-h exposure to sub-freezing conditions in king quail. Exercise induced peak metabolic rate was measured in zebra finch pre-dose and at one, two, ten and twenty days after treated birds ingested 17.5 mg/kg Adonis 3UL &#174; mixed with canola oil and control birds received canola oil alone. Peak metabolic rate measurements were taken during exercise pre-dose and two, six and fourteen days after king quail received 30 mg/kg Adonis 3UL &#174; or canola oil alone. Peak metabolic rate after was not affected by fipronil in Adonis 3UL &#174; or by sham treatment in birds of both species. We conclude that the administered sublethal dose of fipronil did not affect exercise performance in zebra finch or in king quail nor was there evidence of fipronil induced thermoregulatory effects in king quails.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/856</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The times of our lives: women, leisure and postgraduate research</field><field name="creator">McCormack, Coralie</field><field name="description">This study explores the interconnections between leisure and postgraduate research in the lives of six women. The author and the text draw the reader into interactions to create meanings as the women tell their stories. The value of this thesis derives from its time perspective &#8212; the simultaneous view of the women's everyday lives 'across time' (across each woman's lifetime) and 'in time' (during her time as a postgraduate researcher).This research develops and documents a process I term storying stories as an alternative way to approach and re-present interview transcripts. In this three-stage process interview transcripts were viewed through multiple lenses &#8212; active listening, narrative processes, language, context and moments &#8212; to highlight both the individuality and the complexity of a life. The views highlighted by these lenses were then used to write interpretive stories. Finally the interpretive stories were brought together to form a personal experience narrative.These narratives portray how each woman resolved competing demands on her identity to reflexively construct a sense of self over time. Each woman's process of storying leisure revealed a more detailed picture of leisure as 'My Time' &#8212; time just for me &#8212; than has been revealed in the literature to date. The narratives highlighted the storylines (cultural fictions) each woman drew on to construct her leisure around the tension between 'time for me' and 'time for others'. Some women identified and challenged the existing storylines to make time and create spaces for leisure in their busy postgraduate lives.The innovative process of storying stories revealed that postgraduate study itself could be experienced as leisure, or at least tantalisingly leisure-like. Also revealed were the structures and strategies each woman drew upon to balance her life in this context. Some women's stories challenged the pattern of narrative closure suggested by the storylines most often available to women postgraduate researchers. This thesis provides the personal and collective knowledge of the postgraduate experience that is missing from both the texts currently available to postgraduates as well as from universities' postgraduate support programs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From periphery to centre: shaping the history of the central peninsula</field><field name="creator">King, Philip</field><field name="description">Southeast Asia as a regional category of analysis has long been a contested one. Debates over the nature of the cultural matrix or the ecological factors that have produced a regional identity have driven some of the most innovative research in the field of Southeast Asian studies since the Second World War. These debates have not been limited to the types of external boundaries that may help to distinguish the region sandwiched between India to the west and China to the northeast. As the latter have more or less stabilised, attention has increasingly been directed towards the internal composition of the Southeast Asian region and the conventions employed to organise a highly diverse collection of states and peoples. Historians have grown increasingly wary of the dangers in writing history as a means of justifying current political geographies and continue to seek out ways of countering the inherent biases of colonial sources that serve as such an essential window into the past. Once conventional spatial models of a distinct mainland Southeast Asia complimented by a sprawling insular landscape are today splintering as new research points towards the trade networks and patterns of mobility that paid scant attention to any such imaginary divides. In the process new spaces that have formerly existed at the margins of scholarship on the region are emerging as valid subjects of inquiry. Areas and subjects long regarded as peripheries on conventional maps of the region are moving back to the centre. This thesis examines one such &#8216;periphery&#8217; that I refer to as the central peninsula region. This central peninsula is not an essentialised space with distinct territorial and cultural boundaries, but a category of analysis from which we may begin to destabilise conventional representations of that area that today comprises the southern border provinces of Thailand and the northern state of Malaysia. Rather than persist with conventional representations of a vertical civilisational fault line that represents a transitional zone between the mainland and island worlds, what I seek to present in this thesis is an extended critique of conventional colonial and nationalist narratives that have taken a distinctly vertical and centralist view of this region. My study commences from a set of basic inquiries such as whether there are there ways of writing the history of this region beyond that of civilisational/nationalist narratives that appear designed to justify patterns of conflict in the borderlands? To surmount such representations we need to ask in what ways have modern political boundaries and nationalist/civilisational identities been projected into the past to obscure interactions between non-bounded communities and narratives of peace and indigenous forms of modernity? In answering these questions, I seek to demonstrate how the critique opens up new spaces of research&#8212;new histories. In the case of this thesis, much I my interest is directed towards the interior of the central peninsula, an area that has been doubly disadvantaged by the coastal bias exhibited in many histories of the peninsula in general. In asking these types of questions, a major linking theme in this study is the question of progress and development. Given my desire to shift our attention from centre to periphery as a means of recovering a non-state history, examining the link between conventional historical narratives and western theories of progress that have privileged the role of the &#8216;civilised&#8217; centre is a logical step. Modernity&#8212;that great eighteenth and nineteenth expression of technological progress and civilisational sophistication&#8212;critically shaped the way in which colonial and later nationalist observers saw the world around them and speculated its past. But as we are frequently reminded when reading contemporary revisions of Southeast Asian history, modernity was not a condition that was incubated in the centre. Modernity a condition that was fashioned through a constant engagement with external (read indigenous) regions and actors. Likewise, peripheries were not areas that had experienced but a partial experience of modernity, but a discursive Other that was required to give the supposed advancement of the centre definition and meaning. To critically deconstruct narratives of progress and modernity by showing them as a product of interaction therefore serves the duel purpose of deconstructing representations of the peripheral Other. From here we can begin to fashion alternative histories. Such a critical reflection on the role of western narratives of progress and civilisational advancement are highly timely given that many governments in Southeast Asia are currently promoting the development of various state peripheries in accordance with economic theories not unlike those that underpinned a century of colonial exploitation. The Malaysia-Thailand borderlands are one such region that has been identified as subregional development zone or growth triangle that will supposedly act as a catalyst for the re-discovery of a vibrant nonstate regional identity. Whether this will be the case or not is the question that represents the end-point of this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/603</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guanxi network and business performance of Sino-Thai SMEs</field><field name="creator">Sahakijpicharn, Krittakorn</field><field name="description">During the last few decades overseas Chinese business networks have been important for the local economies of many countries in Southeast Asia, including Thailand. Although only 14 percent of the Thai population is Sino-Thai, they still make a significant contribution to the Thai economy. Sino-Thais are estimated to control over 80 percent of listed companies by market capitalisation (Mackie, 1994). One of the key factors behind the success of overseas Chinese in Thailand, and in other countries, is strong social relationships and strong business networks between them. A number of studies have attempted to explain how these social relationships and business networks contribute to Chinese business success. A clear picture of such a connection has, however, still not been achieved. Thus, the main object of this thesis is to examine how social relationships can be used to improve business performance, in particular for the case of Sino-Thai SMEs.To attain this objective, this thesis first reviews the literature relating to both guanxi and organisation networks. Evidence from the literature shows the importance and benefits that both guanxi and organisational networks can provide to its members. In addition, this thesis also reviews the literature relating to strength of ties, network embeddedness, business uncertainty and business performance. By reviewing the literature a theoretical framework, that links these factors together, can be established. From the framework a number of assumptions and hypotheses relating to relationships between the guanxi network, strength of ties, network embeddedness, business uncertainty, and business performance are identified. The Kruskal-Wallis Test, a multiple regression analysis, a multiple discriminant analysis, and factor analysis are all used to test these assumptions and hypotheses. Data from 298 Bangkok based Sino-Thai SMEs provide a number of interesting results. First, strength of ties in the network for the family relationship is stronger than the friend and stranger relationship, while the strength of ties in the network for the friend relationship is stronger than the stranger relationship. Second, strength of ties in the network has a positive impact on the level of network embeddedness. Third, the level of network embeddedness for the family relationship is stronger than that for the friend and stranger relationship, while the level of network embeddedness for the friend relationship is stronger than the stranger relationship. Fourth, network embeddedness has a positive impact on Sino-Thai SMEs&#8217; business performance. Fifth, business uncertainties have a negative effect on Sino-Thai SMEs&#8217; business performance and sixth strength of ties in the network has a negative effect on business uncertainties. This thesis also uses structural equation modeling (SEM) as a means to analyse all variables in the framework simultaneously, and to confirm results of hypotheses testing presented earlier. The result of SEM provides strong support for the empirical findings in this thesis and, also, suggests that network embeddedness is the most important factor that helps to improve business performance as a result of an increase in the strength of ties in the network. Finally, this thesis recommends that policy-makers should encourage SMEs to consider both formal and informal networks as presenting real opportunities to increase their business performance. In particular, policy-makers can encourage and help Sino-Thais SMEs to use the common characteristics of the guanxi network to establish strong business networks with other Chinese entrepreneurs in other countries such as   Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and China. Furthermore, this thesis suggests financial risk management and changes in firm strategy as two major approaches that SEMs can use to reduce some business uncertainties.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/63</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the effect of non-clinical change on Australian GPs? : a survey of regional and rural general practitioners</field><field name="creator">Dalley, Andrew</field><field name="description">Australian General Medical Practices have undergone substantial change over the last two decades. This thesis identifies those changes and examines how a cohort of regional and rural general practitioners has responded to them.

Case studies were developed with the assistance of a group of GP academics from each mainland state, meeting as an electronic Delphi group. The case studies were selected to be of relevance and importance to most GPs in order to stimulate discussion about a defined environmental change.The data were categorised using a stem-based framework supported by the software product Nvivo. Themes were identified and refined as the transcript of each interview was analysed.  Themes were then categorised according to the response of the GPs&#8217; to change and the impact of change on the GP, the general practice and the general practice patient.The findings help in understanding how a cohort of GPs have responded to changes in their environment, how government has introduced reforms, and what response can be made to benefit the longer term delivery of primary care services in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/82</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiduciary finance and the pricing of financial claims: a conceptual approach to investment</field><field name="creator">Gold, Martin Lionel</field><field name="description">Australians have over $1 trillion invested in fiduciary products such as pension funds (ABS, 2006a). Since the early 1980&#8217;s, the policies of successive governments have compelled most of the working population to seek its fortune in financial markets. Over the same period investment has emerged, in its own right, as an important business discipline. Scholars have largely avoided critical examination of the discipline&#8217;s scientific status, choosing instead to concentrate their efforts on refining tests of market efficiency. However, corporate debacles and episodic volatility in financial markets have fostered incredulity amongst stakeholders as to how the market actually operates. The overarching purpose of this thesis, therefore, is to evaluate the science of investment and to espouse a conceptual approach to investment which brings the scholarship and applied practices into closer alignment. Particular emphasis is placed on the funds management operations in the market.Existing scholarship has analysed pricing outcomes assuming that economic norms are reflected in investing practices and financial markets overall. Critiques of the discipline&#8217;s flagship theoretical models, however, find that they are disguised tautologies which have not imparted new knowledge, and as such, are pseudo-scientific. Little progress, it is argued, appears to have been made in the discipline since the formative precepts of investment were promulgated in the 1930s and 1950s. Despite the investment industry&#8217;s economic stature, its microeconomic setting, product structures, and interactions with financial markets, have not been integrated into academic research. Ultimately, the vast majority of investors, being secondary investors, are captives of the industry&#8217;s &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221;. Winning the &#8220;investment game&#8221; is not, as investors might suppose, a strategy of maximising investment returns: in fact it is a risk-averse strategy of tracking average market performance overseen by the industry&#8217;s gatekeepers.

In doing so, it highlights a range of under-explored dimensions of Youth Justice Conferencing that rarely become issues in traditional implementation studies or even phenomenological projects. It highlights quite different understandings of the juvenile offender. This case study offers a perspective on early conferencing practice in New South Wales. While the practice has since been evaluated in terms of the outcomes for the juvenile offender, the practitioners&#8217; roles have not been fully researched. This thesis provides reports obtained directly from the front line&#8212;practitioner interviews&#8212;that are later evaluated as a snapshot of the establishment of reputedly a new approach&#8212;the 1997 Youth Justice Conferencing scheme in New South Wales&#8212;using a governmentality analytic to reveal new tensions, contradictions and insights missed by other studies. These tensions include those between police and convenors, and between ideas of self-regulation and the autonomy of practitioners, which are useful in reassessing the scheme and contributing to the criminal justice debate. I conclude my thesis arguing that the empirical study of &#8216;how&#8217; the juvenile offender is constituted has brought some insights into how identities are constituted and constitute themselves. The empirical research reveals &#8216;how&#8217; the juvenile offender is constituted at the ground level. The practitioner&#8217;s discourse referred to aspects of the juvenile offender&#8217;s personal identity that are brought to bear in conferencing. These aspects are primarily used by the practitioners to build resistance and alternative positions, but have also demonstrated how the constitution of the juvenile offender is an ongoing process of re-inscription through differing professional practices and ideologies. An analysis of the interviews demonstrated that the themes of &#8216;personalisation&#8217;, &#8216;active citizenship&#8217;, &#8216;support&#8217;, &#8216;consumerism&#8217; and &#8216;system participation&#8217; begin to enhance our understanding of the operation of Youth Justice Conferencing schemes in New South Wales and their interrelationship within a broader political context establish and shape what we understand as juvenile offending. While I was interested in power and discourses, the thesis is really about the way practitioners constructed the technologies and rationalities of governmentality of the population of juvenile offenders. Some of those were state constructed, and practitioners were expected to follow them. Given it was such a new program, practitioners in many instances developed their own approaches in the absence of written codes, manuals or training in the early stages of the programs. This is why this study is so interesting. I used documentary evidence but was also able to uncover the way a diverse range of professionals develop and implement new technologies or adapt existing technologies derived from their own professional training or backgrounds to a new population group.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/43</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Game of two halves: preparing young elite rugby players for a future beyond the game</field><field name="creator">Price, Nathan</field><field name="description">The rise to professionalisation in 1995, and the increasing globalisation of rugby has changed the way the sport is viewed and engaged in by talented young athletes. The shift to a more professional work environment, high salaries, and the increased opportunity for young men who, once they leave school, and sometimes before, to seek employment in this workforce, has altered the way young players look, think and behave. With the shift to professionalism, the situation for young elite rugby players has become critical. Many view rugby as a career option, sacrificing education and training in pursuit of lucrative contracts, unaware of the realities of the occupation in which a relatively high number of players &#8216;don&#8217;t make it&#8217;. Those young players who are unsuccessful in their pursuit of a rugby career are often left directionless with no education or training in an alternative occupation or profession. In elite sport, retirement can be extremely difficult to cope with if athletes are not adequately prepared, or have not planned for such an event. This lack of preparation can leave athletes vulnerable to the challenges of retirement. The need for knowledge in this study relates to how young elite rugby players make sense of rugby as work, how they understand themselves as athletes, and how they make sense of their opportunities for a life outside rugby. The opportunities, barriers and needs for career development, planning and education to prepare young athletes for a life outside elite rugby and the ways these young men negotiate their lives and their alternatives are largely unknown. This thesis examines the experiences of young men who are part of the first generation of players who will only experience rugby in its professional format, and provides them with a voice as they pursue work as professional rugby players. More specifically, this study explores issues such as rugby as an occupational choice for young men, how players perceive, and are subsequently prepared for, a life outside rugby, their identification with the sport, and their needs and concerns as elite young rugby players. To gain a further understanding of the resources and opportunities available to assist in the development of these young men and their preparation for a life outside rugby, the study also explores coaches&#8217; and managements&#8217; perspectives and the ways in which they approach these relatively new issues facing young athletes. Investigation in this area of young athletes&#8217; experience has been limited, with the majority of research v focusing on recently retired athletes, or those more established in their professional sport career, as opposed to those beginning to embark on, or pursuing a career in professional sport. There has been little research into the career experiences of elite young rugby players as a basis of understanding how best to prepare them for their future experiences both during, and post-elite athletic performance. The study employed a largely qualitative methodology, interviewing twenty-five young elite rugby players (18-22 years of age) in New Zealand and New South Wales, and eight coaching and management staff from rugby union and the wider sports industry. The use of semi-structured in-depth interviews enabled a rich understanding of the experiences of elite young rugby players from the perspectives of the players, coaches and management. A mixed mode approach was used to a limited extent, where additional quantitative data was collected through the use of a questionnaires provided to one group of participants. The main themes that emerged from this inquiry formed key considerations for the preparation of elite young rugby players in their future beyond rugby. These considerations highlighted the career development needs, barriers, opportunities and experiences of elite young rugby players as they pursued a career in professional rugby. Among others, the analysis of interviews identified an identity heavily invested in rugby, unrealistic predictions of their future rugby life cycle, the structure of the work, and support from their clubs and academies as key inhibitors to players career development and post-rugby planning. The study revealed that the involvement in elite rugby largely does not facilitate the accomplishment of developmental tasks that athletes require later in life. In many cases these young men are sacrificing the potential breadth of their future selves in the pursuit of a rugby career. Thus, the study points to the need for a greater focus in the support, assistance and resources for young elite rugby players in their career development and planning for their post-rugby future. These young men are in many cases at risk of having no tangible entry into an occupation or career should they not succeed in professional rugby.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/46</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tainted fruit</field><field name="creator">McNeill, Pearlie</field><field name="description">I have written two earlier books about my family. Tainted Fruit is the third and continues the thread of dialogue I have been weaving into my consciousness about the impact of family violence on my life. One of the Family is a first person, autobiographical account of my growing up years, related along a chronological time-line. Counting the Rivers, is also chronological, but the story is written as a novel, using a fragmentary style rather than chapters. This structure includes pages of my patient file, and italicised paragraphs written from the point of view of the main character. This novel documents my experience as a psychiatric patient in Sydney, in the era of the 1960s and 70s. Tainted Fruit, a reflective book, is then, the third book of this trilogy and is not circumscribed by the defines or conventions of any one genre but instead, borrows from many genres: fiction, memoir, journals (etc) in order to create its own experimental, imaginative form.  I have sought to explore a broader range of options for my own narrating voice.I have sought to examine the implications of violence within my own family, the far-reaching implications of growing up with domestic violence as a backdrop to daily life and reverberations of awareness and shame. I am concerned too, about how that experience of childhood can continue a cycle of violence that for some is hard to resist.My research for both the book and the exegesis has involved a wide range of sources: books, newspapers, journals, magazines, maps, oral history recordings and transcripts, rent-book records, genealogical documents, interviews with members of my family, visits to relevant settings and website material: detailing information from writers&#8217; panels as well as interviews with individual writers. The exegesis chapters are organised around the narrating voice. My particular interest has been point of view. What power is invested in the narrator and where do they stand in relation to the events, the people, they are writing about? My aim has been to closely examine the complex negotiation between narrative and perspective, illuminating the emphasis narrators give to certain aspects of a story, and broadening that aim to explore the question how do we writers write about violence?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/347</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transportation and urban development : the past and future of Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Svein Ivar</field><field name="description">Urban areas of today are very often reliant on the private automobile as opposed to a public transport system. This is certainly the case for the Sydney metropolitan area. The result of a large reliance on the private automobile has been high levels of pollution and congested city centres. If this problem is to be controlled, changes have to be made to the way the metropolitan area is being developed. Different ideas have been proposed throughout time in order to secure a lower use of cars. One reoccurring suggestion is the need for more compact, or planned, communities where people find most of the amenities needed, such as homes, jobs, shopping and recreation facilities. If planners and decision makers are able to secure developments where the end result is a lower level of driving, it becomes possible to limit some of the problems cities of today struggle with. A project that has already influenced driving patterns in the Sydney metropolitan area is the Sydney Harbour Tunnel. Arguably the Tunnel has not been any great success, due to it having created an increase in total cross-harbour traffic. Future projects that will also have an impact on driving patterns are the proposed Cross City Tunnel, the proposed extension of the current tramline to Circular Quay, and a new inner city rail line. These latter projects will, however, as opposed to the Tunnel, have a positive impact on people&#8217;s driving patterns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/367</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talking about food and nutrition: women and popular Australian women's magazines</field><field name="creator">McVie, Danielle</field><field name="description">Review of the literature quite clearly indicates that there is need for a comprehensive review of nutrition messages presented to women. This is important given women&#8217;s considerable and continuing influence on family food decisions and their reported use of magazines as a source of information in the media. Women frequently cite women&#8217;s magazines to be an important source of nutrition information, however few studies have investigated this relationship in depth. It is important to understand how women use the information in women&#8217;s magazines and to what extent they have the potential to influence the food decisions women make on a day to day basis.The principle objective of this study was to gain insight into the food and nutrition issues considered to be of importance among women and in popular women&#8217;s magazines. This project aimed to identify similarities and differences in the food and nutrition issues raised by women and those presented in women&#8217;s magazines in order to provide insight into the role women&#8217;s magazines have in the provision of food and nutrition information to women. This study was conducted in three parts.The first study involved focus group discussions with three cohorts of women, that is, teenage girls aged 13-16 years, and women aged 25-34 years and 45-54 years. Nine focus groups were conducted. This study provided insight into women&#8217;s use and perceptions of women&#8217;s magazines and aided in the development of the content analysis instrument. Results indicated that participants in this study did not actively seek nutrition information from magazines. Rather, magazines primarily operated as an incidental source of information, and nutrition information acted as a feature that helped to sell one magazine over another. Learning about current nutrition issues was generally not the participants&#8217; motivation for buying women&#8217;s magazines. Participants also indicated that they did not place a high degree of trust in, and were skeptical of, the information presented in women&#8217;s magazines.The second study involved two semi-structured interviews with approximately half the women from each cohort who participated in the focus group discussions. Each woman participated in two semi-structured interviews. The first interview was conducted approximately five months after the focus groups and the second interview four months after the first interview. The interviews provided insight into the food and nutrition concerns of women. The results indicated that participants were not anxious about food and nutrition issues and did not think about food and nutrition in a risk framework. Weight concerns and the desire to lose weight were the most frequently discussed food and nutrition issue among all groups of women. Non-weight concerns were more likely to be raised by women who had current health concerns for themselves or someone in their family.The third study consisted of a 12 month content analysis of eight popular women's magazines. This study was conducted concurrently with the semistructured interviews. Magazines were analysed for the food and nutrition content of advertisements, editorial items and cover headlines. This study provided insight into the food and nutrition messages presented in women's magazines.The results of this study indicated that magazine advertising content is largely dominated by advertisements for non-core products (i.e. foods that were not listed as a part of the core food groups according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating (Commonwealth of Australia 1998). Advertisements were also more likely to use consumer related statements as primary promotion messages. The majority of nutrition related statements were related to general nutrition. Results of the content analysis of editorial content highlighted that the predominant food and nutrition messages related to dieting and weight loss, followed by food or product specific articles. The dominance of dieting and weight loss messages was also reflected in magazine headlines. The content analysis demonstrated clear inconsistencies in the food and nutrition messages they presented to women and were surprising in the limited presentation of food and nutrition issues that could be considered of direct interest to women such as osteoporosis, nutrition and aging or vegetarianism.This thesis demonstrated a close alignment between the food and nutrition concerns of women and the issues presented to them via the content of women&#8217;s magazines. Both the women who participated in focus groups and semistructured interviews and the content of women&#8217;s magazines content analysed have a very narrow focus regarding food and nutrition issues. Weight concern related to self identity (but not health) was the main concern raised by both the women and the magazines. This close alignment supports the findings of previous surveys where women have self reported that they consider magazines an important source of food and nutrition information. However it is not possible in this study to determine the direction of this alignment, that is, whether the magazines responded to or acted to lead women&#8217;s food and nutrition concerns.In addition, it was evident from the content analysis that magazines were driven by the commercial imperative to sell products, including food and nutrition products, to women. Interestingly, the women who participated in the focus group discussions identified that women&#8217;s magazines aimed to sell them products. Despite this, the women who participated in the semi-structured interviews indicated that magazines did raise their awareness of some food and nutrition issues.This study has highlighted the potential for health professionals to utilise women&#8217;s magazines to raise a broader range of food and nutrition issues, and to provide the necessary &#8216;expert credence&#8217; sought by the women. However, this involvement of health professionals should be within the &#8216;recreational&#8217; and entertainment context of the role of magazines in women&#8217;s lives. The women in this study clearly identified that they primarily buy magazines for the entertainment they provide. It is therefore important that health professionals learn to position broader food and nutrition issues within an entertainment framework.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/859</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aesthetics, music education and the construction of school knowledge</field><field name="creator">Sang, Vivienne Huifen</field><field name="description">This study examines the construction of school knowledge with particular focus on the impact of socio-cultural-economic discourses on music education. The context of the study is the Integrated Curriculum as structured in school textbooks for secondary education in Taiwan. The study is guided by the following questions: 1. What is the impact of the socio-cultural-economic discourses on the integration of music knowledge? 2. How is the integration of knowledge realised in the Arts and Humanities textbooks? 3. How are the goals set for the domain of Arts and Humanities made manifest through the integration of knowledge? A mixed research method and the case study approach are employed to answer these questions. Regarding the epistemological factors interwoven in the Arts and Humanities textbooks, several theoretical perspectives offered in integrated curriculum, music education, and critical theory scholarship form the conceptual, qualitative foundation of this study. A quantitative approach investigates the extent of integration of arts knowledge and the relative coverage of different arts disciplines and a modified form of Critical Discourse Analysis is employed as the methodological tool to explore a selection of discourses in texts. Data sources include the relevant documents of the Integrated Curriculum project, textbooks and the National Syllabus which is taken as the blueprint of educational practices in Taiwan. Data analysis involves investigating integrated models, the relationships between the content knowledge, competency benchmarks, and curriculum goals, and the socio-cultural-economic discourses in and/or behind the texts. The conceptual framework employed throughout the study is based on the aesthetic theories and the critiques of culture industry proposed by Theodor W. Adorno. Based on his social observation, he argues a loss of autonomy of the individual where music is being manipulated as a means of social control. The socio-economic phenomenon of &#8216;cultural turn&#8217; can be viewed as Adorno&#8217;s &#8216;culture industry&#8217;, generating what Adorno called &#8216;fetished mass culture&#8217;. The lenses of Adornian music sociology employed in this study illuminate the interaction of music with other social agencies. The employment of the lenses to music education further reveals the deconstruction of music knowledge and music aesthetics in the construction of school knowledge. The study reveals the prevalent discourses of how the de-differentiation of &#8216;culture&#8217; and &#8216;economy&#8217; affects the construction of school knowledge. The four series of textbooks adopt different approaches to fulfil the goal of knowledge integration in the context of the Integrated Curriculum. Their approaches manifest how the conception of integration is contextualised in the socio-cultural-economic context of Taiwan. The three case studies indicate that: (1) The creative education is manipulated as an infrastructure for creative industry; the examination of film music points out that the musical signifiers have been turned into the commercially signified. (2) The aesthetic education is transferred to declarative knowledge; the examination of western classical music illuminates the practice of musical symbols in discursive discourses. (3) Multicultural education has become a battlefield of identity and control; the stories of Taiwanese Bunun people disclose a lack of multicultural aesthetics in the appreciation of multicultural heritage. This study thus points to the need for educators to pay close attention to school music education which allows or denies possibilities for aesthetics. The findings also contribute to the research literature about the current status of music education in the broader context of the Integrated Curriculum. The study may also have relevance to educators concerning issues of music appreciation, aesthetics, and critical pedagogy of music education.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of kindergarten children's multiliterate practices in their homes</field><field name="creator">Turner, Margaret</field><field name="description">Children who enter kindergarten bring to the school environment, a wide range of abilities in literacy. Prior literacy experiences in the home and the wider community have been shown to contribute towards these wide ranging abilities and, consequently, future success in literacy at school.Our society today, though, is changing rapidly. Our task, therefore, as educators is to prepare our children to function in a future civilization created by the biggest leap in technology since the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago. We have entered a time when advances in technology are having an important effect on literacy development. The literacy needs and demands of a changing society must be addressed in school when children are very young.This inquiry was an exploration at three Sydney metropolitan schools of kindergarten children&#8217;s multiliterate practices in their homes. The inquiry endeavoured to establish the relationship between these practices and the socioeconomic backgrounds and gender of these children. It also endeavoured to establish the relationship between the kindergarten children&#8217;s practices and skills with the expectations of policy and curriculum documents in the first year at school of the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education and Training (DET).  The following research questions guided this inquiry:*	What are the multiliterate practices in the homes of kindergarten children at three Sydney metropolitan schools? *	What is the relationship between these multiliterate practices and socioeconomic background? *	What is the relationship between these multiliterate practices and gender?*	How do the multiliterate practices and skills of these kindergarten children relate to the expectations, in the first year at school, of current policy and curriculum of the New South Wales (NSW) Department of Education and Training (DET)?The inquiry was qualitative in nature and employed mixed methodologies of ethnographic techniques, case study and narrative inquiry.There were three phases in this inquiry; the initial phase that involved surveying 123 kindergarten parents in three schools; the immersion phase that involved observing five case study children in their homes as they engaged in a range of literacy practices including print and paper-based literacies and techno-literacies, and the analysis of the NSW DET documents relevant to literacy learning in the first year at school. It was found that while socioeconomic background and gender differences existed, all kindergarten children experienced a wide range of multiliterate practices in their homes that comprised print and paper-based literacies and techno-literacies. It was also found that parents held different views about the role that techno-literacies played in learning to read and write and these views seemed to mirror those of early years teachers, namely that print and paper-based skills were more highly valued for young emergent readers and writers.It was also found that assessment of kindergarten children on entry to school did not recognise young children&#8217;s techno-literacy skills in their out-of-school worlds and while curriculum documents included an extensive range of techno-literacy experiences and expectations of learning by the end of the first year at school, schools needed to do more in providing teaching and learning programs that valued young children&#8217;s multiliterate experiences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/803</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of postweld heat treatment of quenched and tempered pressure vessel steels</field><field name="creator">Sterjovski, Zoran</field><field name="description">Longitudinal and circumferential welds in transportable pressure vessels are produced by submerged-arc welding using a single vee preparation and multiple weld runs. Quenched and tempered (QT) steels, which are commonly used for transportable pressure vessels, require mandatory postweld heat treatment (PWHT) regardless of the plate thickness. During their life transportable pressure vessels may have up to four PWHT cycles, and concerns have emerged about possible effects on material properties such as hardness, tensile strength, impact toughness and fracture toughness.This thesis reports on the weld procedure, microstructural evaluation and various mechanical properties (bend, yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, fatigue, impact toughness, CTOD fracture toughness and hardness) for 11 mm, 12 mm and 20 mm QT steel weldments. The 11 mm and 20 mm base plates investigated were BIS80PV, which is a pressure vessel grade steel. The 12 mm plate was BIS80, which is structural grade steel but deemed a possible candidate for pressure vessels due to superior impact and fracture toughness properties over currently used QT pressure vessel steels. The parent metal, heat affected zone and weld metal regions of each weldment were examined, and then exposed to temperatures and times in the PWHT range.Although there was no apparent change in microstructure at an optical level and little change in hardness for up to four postweld heat treatments, there was a marked decrease in hardness of the parent metal for more extensive heat treatments (increasing Holloman parameter). There was also evidence of minor secondary hardening in the 11 mm and 20 mm BIS80PV parent plate following short heat treatment times. The weld metal (WM) and HAZ hardness typically decreased with one PWHT cycle and subsequently stabilised with further PWHT cycles.For all test plates, results are also presented for Charpy V-notch impact tests in the parent metal, HAZ and weld metal region, and CTOD fracture toughness tests in the PM region. The effect of exposure to multiple PWHT cycles on these properties is discussed. A decrease in impact energy and fracture toughness with an increase in the number of heat treatments was evident in the parent metal. In contrast, the weld metal showed a decrease in impact energy after two PWHT cycles, and then an increase towards the original impact energy after a further two cycles.In PM samples, which have been extensively tempered in the manufacturing process, the mechanism by which toughness properties are affected by cumulative PWHT holding time is through the coarsening and coalescence of second phase carbide particles. These particles decrease impact energy by the formation of larger voids in the plastic zone ahead of the crack tip or by the initiation of cleavage fracture. These two phenomena decrease the energy required for fracture.In WM with an as-solidified structure, ductile failure in the form of void coalescence is initiated by non-metallic inclusions. This leads to an initially high impact toughness, which then decreases after PWHT because of the nucleation and coarsening of metastable Fe3C precipitates that promote quasi-cleavage type fracture. Upon exposure to further PWHT cycles the impact energy begins to increase again due to the dissolution of the metastable carbides and the formation of finer, more stable carbides based on elements such as Cr, Mo, Ni and Nb. This change in the form of the carbide promotes localised fracture by micro-plasticity, with void formation and coalescence.Additionally, cross-weld root bend (180&#176;) and tensile tests were carried out before and after PWHT. None of the bend samples showed any evidence of  cracking or tearing, hence confirming the ductility of the weldment. The tensile properties of the BIS80PV cross-weld samples complied with the Australian Standards, but the tensile properties of the BIS80 cross-weld samples only complied in the as-welded condition.Tensile properties of the PM showed no significant trends with the number of PWHT cycles and the fatigue crack growth rate increased slightly in relation to the number of PWHT cycles or PWHT holding time.One of the primary roles of PWHT is to reduce residual stresses caused by the welding process. Residual stress measurements using the hole drilling method were made to ascertain the need for PWHT. Residual stresses, measured in the weld centre-line by the hole drilling technique, were compressive along both the longitudinal and transverse directions and were no greater than 250 MPa (between 0.2-0.5 times the yield strength at room temperature). Although, the presence of residual stresses (tensile and compressive) of greater magnitude is not excluded, the residual stress measurements demonstrated that PWHT significantly reduced the magnitude of the residual stresses.The ability to predict the impact energy of a pressure vessel steel subjected to various cumulative PWHT holding times is beneficial to pressure vessel inspectors, who are misguidedly instructed to be wary of the mechanical properties of vessels after 6 hours of cumulative PWHT holding time. The original impact energy of the steel, which is determined by its chemical composition, microstructure and thermo-mechanical treatment determines the cumulative PWHT time before the impact properties of the QT steel decrease below the specified 40 J limit at &#8211;20&#176;C. An artificial neural network (ANN) model has been developed using an artificial neural network to predict the effect of PWHT time and other variables such as composition and test temperature on impact energy. This ANN model provides a valuable design tool for predicting impact toughness as a function of composition, heat treatment and testing conditions.Finally, the performance of BIS80 was evaluated and its superior impact  oughness and fracture toughness properties over BIS80PV were confirmed. However, the tensile properties of postweld heat-treated 12 mm BIS80 cross-weld samples did not comply with AS3597, the Australian Standard for QT steels; and the PM stress ratio exceeded the specified limit of 0.93. These &#8216;deficiencies&#8217; could be remedied by (i) discarding PWHT or (ii) using a high strength WM; and (iii) abandoning or relaxing the stress ratio requirement, which is of questionable significance, under conditions of high strain rate impact loading (road collision).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/464</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced materials for electrodes and electrolyte in rechargeable lithium batteries</field><field name="creator">Chew, Sau yen</field><field name="description">The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery possesses many outstanding advantages over the well known rechargeable battery systems, in particularly higher energy density and longer shelf life, as well as not suffering from the memory effect problems of Ni-MH batteries. Those advantages are making it the greatest energy source of choice for the portable electronic market. Graphite and LiCoO2 are commonly used in commercial Li-ion battery. Despite their widespread utilization, the current electro-active materials have reached to a limit in terms of delivering even higher power, energy density, and longer cycle life for the new, emerging field of large-scale energy storage systems, such as in the automotive industry. Hybrid and fully electric cars need safer, cheaper, and higher performing batteries in order to offer an important alternative to combustion engines. To overcome the shortcomings of the current Li-ion battery, improvements are needed to push the Li-ion technology to the next level. Hence, the motivation for this PhD work is to search for potential electro-active materials, by means of the synthesis of film and powder based electrodes, fine-tuning of the composition of the composite electrodes, and characterization of them for possible application in Li-ion rechargeable batteries. Among the anode candidates studied were free-standing carbon nanotube (CNT) films, tin glycolate, and polypyrrole coated silicon (Si-PPy) nanocomposite materials. Two cathode candidates were also studied: lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4) thin film, and polypyrrole coated lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8-PPy) composite. Ionic liquid based polymer electrolyte was also studied to enhance Li-ion battery safety features. Free-standing CNT film electrodes have been synthesized by a simple vacuum filtration method. The free-standing electrodes were produced without any binder or metal current collector, which significantly reduced the total weight. The free-standing CNT film electrodes were also flexible and had good electrical conductivity with the addition of carbon black. Three different types of CNTs were used, i.e. single-wall CNTs (SWCNTs), double-wall CNTs (DWCNTs) and multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs). The films based on MWCNT are much better than SWCNT and DWCNT films in terms of their electrochemical performance, with stable cycling behavior of 300 mAh g-1 after 40 cycles. A detailed study revealed that MWCNT electrode exhibited a reversible, sharp, and intense peak at approximately 0.15 V vs. Li/Li+ during the Li+ de-intercalation process. A thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer was observed on the surface of MWCNTs after prolonged cycling. This proved that only multi-wall CNTs have the capability for significant Li+ ion intercalation/de-intercalation. Novel tin glycolate particles were prepared by the polyol-mediated method. The prepared powders consist of fine tin-based particles (80 &#8211; 120 nm), encapsulated within tin glycolate shells. When applied as an anode material for Li-ion batteries, the glycolate shells buffered the volume expansion upon Li-Sn alloying, and thus the tin glycolate particles showed a high specific charge of 416 mAh g-1 beyond 50 cycles. Novel Si-PPy nanocomposite was prepared by coating the Si particle surfaces with PPy by the in situ chemical polymerization method. The cycle stability of Si-PPy nanocomposite electrodes was greatly enhanced with 50 wt. % PPy. The loading level of PPy plays a major role in determining the stability of the nanocomposite, and consequently creates a good matrix to improve the electrical conductivity, buffer the volume change during cycling, and prevent cracking and pulverization of the Si. A new approach was developed to rapidly synthesize nanostructured LiMn2O4 thin films by flame spray deposition (FSD) and in situ annealing. The LiMn2O4 films on stainless steel current collector exhibited good cyclability, with two pairs of redox peaks at approximately 4.00 and 4.15 V vs. Li/Li+. The study indicated that spinel LiMn2O4 thin films can be prepared by the fast and efficient FSD method. LiV3O8-PPy composites were synthesized by a low-temperature solution route followed by an in situ polymerization method. For LiV3O8 material, only 24 wt. % of PPy is needed to enhance the electrical conductivity and stability of the composite electrode, which delivered a specific charge of 183 mAh g-1 beyond 100 cycles. A solution casting method was used to prepare IL-PE composite membrane.

In other words, the workplace is about administrative practices of guidance, surveillance and compliance (Iedema, 1995). In most cases, these social acts of guidance, surveillance and compliance are realised by discursive practices or workplace genres. Specifically, this study investigates the discursive practices of compliance, known as Directives, with a view to understanding the effect tenor relations have on the language choices of workers in Japan and Australia. The effect is described by using the tools of systemic functional grammar, particularly from the perspective of the interpersonal metafunction. The two corpora are analysed from &#8216;around&#8217; (the lexicogrammar) and from &#8216;above&#8217;, (the semantics). The results show that, while the language and meanings of Directives in both languages are highly sensitive to tenor relations, the nature of this sensitivity differs. In general terms, in the workplace, it seems that the Japanese language is more interpersonally oriented, while English is less so, with a tendency to be rather more ideationally oriented. The results go some way to supplying linguistic evidence for the claim that Japanese society in general is hierarchical (Nakane, 1970), while Australian society is less so.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/695</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the performance of the new MOSkin dosimeter as a quality assurance tool for pulsed dose-rate (PDR) prostate brachytherapy, and the effect of rectal heterogeneity on the dose delivered to the rectal wall</field><field name="creator">Kwan, Ian S</field><field name="description">Brachytherapy is a common treatment modality used for treating prostate cancer. The radiation is emitted from within the prostate, which focuses the damage on the tumour rather than the surrounding healthy tissue. However, due to the close proximity of the rectum to the prostate, there is a possibility that the rectum will receive too much radiation dose during prostate treatment. This may lead to post-treatment rectal complications that range in severity from general rectal discomfort and bleeding, to the development of a rectal fistula that may require surgical intervention. Currently, there is no real-time quality assurance tool used to verify that the rectum does not receive too much radiation dose.The Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) at the University of Wollongong, Australia, has developed a new MOSFET dosimeter called the MOSkin with a unique packaging design that should demonstrate some benefits over other MOSFET dosimeters. The MOSkin can potentially serve as a real-time rectal dosimeter for use during a PDR or HDR brachytherapy treatment.The general aim of this research is to characterise the performance of the new MOSkin dosimeter, and to determine whether the unique design of the MOSkin demonstrates dosimetric advantages over other dosimeters for brachytherapy, and in certain other applications. The performance characteristics of the MOSkin were explored by exposing it to a 6 MV x-ray field delivered by a linear accelerator (LINAC), and also with an Ir-192 PDR brachytherapy source.The MOSkin was irradiated with a 6 MV, 1010 cm3 photon beam with the gantry set to 100 cm source-to-surface distance, and its dose response was compared to the response of a CC13 compact ionization chamber, and a couple of fiber optic dosimeters.The fiber optic dosimeters had either a 0.5 or 1 mm diameter scintillating crystal attached to one end of the optical fiber. The MOSkin&#8217;s ability to measure the skin dose to a depth of 0.07 mm, which corresponds to the nominal depth of the basal cell layer of the epidermis, was compared to Attix chamber and fiber optic dosimeter measurements, along with skin dose measurements reported in other studies found in the literature. My research was primarily concerned with dosimetry at shallow depths in the phantom because it was believed that the MOSkin&#8217;s packaging design would prove advantageous over other dosimeters at such depths.With regards to brachytherapy, the dose response of the MOSkin was compared to the response of a RADFET dosimeter within a rectal phantom. Brachytherapy treatment planning systems (TPS) calculate the dose by assuming that the human body is a large, homogeneous water-equivalent material. The effect that a hollow, air-filled rectal cavity has on the anterior rectal dose was investigated by measuring the dose delivered to the inner wall of a rectal phantom while it was empty, and comparing dose measurement to the dose measured within a homogeneous rectal phantom, and the dose calculated by the TPS. The results were also corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations written with the Geant4 toolkit.The results of an early stage, Phase II clinical trial at St. George Cancer Care Centre are discussed. The MOSkin was used to measure the dose delivered to the anterior wall of the patient&#8217;s rectum during PDR brachytherapy patients during treatment, and the results are compared to the dose calculated by the TPS. The results were also compared to the observations made during the phantom study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/818</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arab community and religious leaders' views about utilisation of mental health services amongst Arabic-speaking people in Australia</field><field name="creator">Youssef, Jacqueline</field><field name="description">Traditionally, utilisation of mental health services by Arabic-speaking communities in Australia has been low. Interviews were conducted with 35 key informants from Arabic-speaking backgrounds, exploring their perceptions of mental illness in the Arab community, together with their views about preferred forms of support and treatment. Transcript analysis of audio-taped interviews identified barriers to professional mental health help-seeking and utilisation of mental health services in the Arabic community. Shame and stigma appeared to be the overwhelming hindrance to accessing services, due to strong cultural prohibitions on exposing any personal or family matters to outsiders. The findings emphasised the perceived negative effect of mental illness on important cultural institutions, such as marriage. The results revealed strong concerns about confidentiality and lack of trust in service providers. Religious leaders were identified as important sources of help for mental health problems.The role of Arab clergy within their community is well known and respected. The second study explored the beliefs, attitudes and roles that Arab religious leaders have in relation to people with mental illness in their communities. Eighty-five Muslim and 85 Christian Arab religious leaders were surveyed using a structured questionnaire which solicited their perceptions of the causes of mental illness, attitudes toward people with mental illness and opinions regarding treatment and medication. Furthermore, the questionnaire focussed on types of support provided by clergy for those with mental illness and their families and the scope of their awareness of Community Mental Health Services. Findings indicated that Arab clergy believed drug and alcohol addiction, stressful life events, childhood trauma and spiritual poverty were the most important causes of mental illness. Over 50% of Arab clergy believed that psychiatric medications were addictive and harmful to the body in the long term, although about 65% thought that medication was helpful as a treatment.  Generally, Arab clergy&#8217;s attitudes toward the mentally ill were positive and most had normalising attitudes with 73% agreeing that &#8220;people with mental illness have an illness like any other&#8221;. Most respondents agreed that people with mental illness could be helped and suggested they were relatively comfortable with and willing to provide support to people with mental illness. However, most also indicated a lack of sufficient knowledge to be of effective help and they were not confident making referrals to mental health services.Arab clergy were unfamiliar with their local Community Mental Health Services but were unanimously predisposed to referring to such sources of help.  The key factors to establishing Arab clergy&#8217;s collaboration with professional mental health services were shown to be the mental health provider&#8217;s reputation, religious beliefs, values and level of awareness of Arab culture.  Collaboration with Arab clergy and professional mental health providers may promote and influence better access to existing mental health services and improve the help seeking process to increase future service utilisation. There is an immediate need for government and non-government organisations with interests in mental health to initiate collaborative work with Arab clergy in order to address access, utilisation and referral issues. There is also a need for educational opportunities and two-way communication with existing mental health services to improve the capacity of Arabic-speaking clergy to better support people with mental illness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/831</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat associations of the long-nosed potoroo (potoroos tridactylus) at multiple spatial scales</field><field name="creator">Norton, Melinda A</field><field name="description">The long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) is a threatened, ground-dwelling marsupial known to have been highly disadvantaged by changes brought about since European settlement in Australia.  Key threats to the species are believed to be fox predation and habitat loss and/or fragmentation. In order to conserve the species, the important habitat elements for the species at both the coarse and fine scale need to be identified and managed appropriately.  The aims of this study were to examine the coarse- and fine-scale habitat preferences of the long-nosed potoroo, using a variety of techniques, in two National Park reserves (Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park) in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales in order to inform management. The ecology of the long-nosed potoroo in this region is poorly understood, making this study both timely and critical.    Assessments of the morphometrics of the local long-nosed potoroo populations and their relative abundance, in addition to fox predation pressure at these localities, were also undertaken to assist in the conservation of the local potoroo population.Live-trapping was conducted in autumn and spring, from 2004 to 2008, at 103 trap sites across the two study areas and morphometric data were collected. The local long-nosed potoroos were found to be larger in size than Victorian animals but smaller than north-eastern NSW animals supporting the concept of a cline in body size for the species with weight increasing with latitude on the mainland.  Sexual dimorphism was also observed with adult males having larger body weights, head lengths and pes lengths.  Between one to two thirds of all males and females at either study area were only captured in a single trapping session, indicative of high levels of transience and/or low levels of survivorship.  Of the two study areas, Barren Grounds Nature Reserve supported a larger number of individuals and appeared to have a greater degree of home range overlap between individuals, which was considered indicative of a higher quality habitat at this study area. Overall, the two study area populations appear to have increased over the course of the study.  The sand plot technique, used in both study areas each Autumn and Spring from 2005 to 2008 as a second technique to monitor potoroo relative abundance, was considered less effective than trapping.  This was due to its inability to decipher between individuals with overlapping home ranges in higher density populations and the species&#8217; reduced utilisation of tracks compared to many other species. A number of habitat attributes were examined at each trap site to allow comparison with trap success ratings as an indication of macrohabitat preferences.  In Spring 2007 and Autumn 2008, microhabitat use was also examined at both study areas, using the spool-and-line technique and an assessment of forage diggings.  The results indicated that while potoroos were trapped at sites with a wide range of macrohabitat attributes, the species displayed a number of macrohabitat preferences, particularly for greater levels of canopy and shrub cover, for ferns as a dominant ground cover type and for lower levels of floristic diversity in ground cover. Differences in the macrohabitats present at each study area, as well as those preferred at either study area, were also observed.  Microhabitat attributes were assessed along the spool paths as well as in the available habitat to allow comparison of observed and expected usage.  The spooling results revealed that while most individual potoroos had significant preferences for some microhabitat attributes, no clear trends were evident across all individuals spooled.  Comparison of the presence/absence of forage diggings and associated microhabitat attributes at systematic sample points within the available habitat was also undertaken. Potoroos also displayed preferences for foraging in locations with higher shrub cover densities and more open ground cover.  Between the two scales of investigation, patterns of habitat preferences differed. The species&#8217; habitat use appears to be influenced by both macro- and micro-scale preferences, highlighting the importance of examining habitat associations at multiple scales.The relative abundance of foxes fluctuated over the study as indicated by sand plots monitored in both Autumn and Spring from 2005 to 2008 in both study areas. Yet despite the often high fox predation risks, individual potoroos were not all preferentially utilising higher levels of ground cover or habitat complexity.  Despite dense vegetative cover being a common attribute in potoroo habitat, my results support the theory that the species requires habitat patchiness, with structural and floristic preferences varying during different activities.  This includes the use of relatively open, floristically-diverse patches for foraging activity, providing some level of cover from aerial but not ground predation during foraging. Analysis of fox scats at the same study sites indicated a high prevalence of potoroo remains. Consequently, it was not considered likely that the species is afforded adequate protection against fox predation by its use of habitat.  Future management should aim to perpetuate the diversity of vegetation attributes at each of the study areas while avoiding practices that simplify such habitat. The effective control of foxes in and around potoroo habitat was also considered likely to assist in the conservation of the species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/832</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel nanostructured electrodes</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yong</field><field name="description">Nanotechnology provides an effective and direct way to create novel properties and phenomena through the reduction in material sizes without changing the materials&#8217; chemical composition. A number of routes to the preparation of novel nanostructured electrodes were investigated in this thesis. These involve the formation of nanoporous opaline electrodes, three dimensional nanofibrous networks and the synthesis of flexible nanoelectrodes based on highly dense ordered aligned carbon nanotubes and conducting polymers. Excellent improvements with the use of nanostructures in a wide range of application areas such as methanol oxidation, photoelectrochemical cells, enzyme biosensors, cell culturing and energy storage are presented in this research work.Nanoporous opaline structures including inverse opals and opals were prepared by either electrodepositing Pt or sputter coating ITO onto self-assembled polystyrene (PS) synthetic opals, followed by the removal of the PS opal templates. A highly ordered dense nanoporous structure with the porous structure on the top (so-called Pt inverse opal) or with the porous structure on the bottom (so-called ITO opal) was consequently obtained after the removal of PS templates. The improvement in electrochemical area with the use of nanostructures was observed during electrochemical characterisation. The resultant nanostructured Pt inverse opal electrodes were employed in electro-oxidation of methanol. Compared with the Pt film electrode, the nanostructured Pt inverse opal electrode showed a higher catalytic performance and good stability with a 100 mV negative shift of the potential of methanol oxidation. The mesoporous ITO opal electrode was used as the substrate for the electrodeposition of polyterthiophene and the resultant structure was subsequently utilized in photoelectrochemical cells. An excellent power-conversion efficiency of 0.109% and an outstanding short circuit current density of 1470 &#956;A&#8226;cm-2 for polyterthiophene deposited at room temperature were obtained; dramatically improved from the previous published work.Nanofibrous electrodes were fabricated from biomaterials (such as DNA and poly(styrene-&#946;-isobutylene-&#946;-styrene) (SIBS)) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using the electrospinning technique. Initial studies quantitatively determined the influence of solution properties (such as the solution ionic conductivity, surface tension and viscosity) and process parameters (e.g. tip-to-collector distance, applied potential and the feed rate) on the electrospinning results. Results showed that good electrospun fibrous networks could be obtained from the solution with comparatively high conductivity and viscosity with low surface tension. It was also found that the average diameter of the electrospun fibers decreased with decreased feed rates, increased tip-to-collector distance and increase in the potential employed. With the addition of SWNT, both biomaterial nanofiber electrodes exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties. The resulting DNA based electrospun fiber electrode showed a broad linearity range and high sensitivity in enzyme biosensors. The SIBS/SWNT nanofibrous electrode demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and suitability for the growth of L-929 cells.Flexible, light and highly conductive nanostructured electrodes were prepared from aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) and conducting polymers by coating with Pt coated poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)/PVDF. Pt nanoparticles were subsequently electrodeposited on the ACNT/Pt/PVDF structure. The utilization of the nanostructured ACNT/conducting polymer electrodes in anodic methanol oxidation and as anodic materials in Lithium-ion batteries was demonstrated. Pt nanoparticles coated ACNT/Pt/PVDF electrode exhibited an outstanding electrochemical capacity (133 Fg-1) and amazing electrochemical surface area (143 m2g-1 for Pt nanoparticles). The Pt nanoparticles-ACNT/Pt/PVDF electrode also showed a 2.5 times higher steady current density for methanol oxidation when compared with the ACNT/Pt/PVDF electrode. A stable current density over a long period (more than 12 hours) was obtained. A 50% improvement in capacity during Lithium-ion battery tests when compared with a SWNT paper was obtained with the ACNT/PEDOT/PVDF electrode.Nanostructured flexible and conductive electrodes were also obtained from ACNTs and biomaterials (such as SIBS and poly(lactide-co-glycolide)). SWNTs or Pt were introduced to improve the conductivity. A significant improvement in electrochemical properties with the addition of Pt or SWNT was obtained. The biocompatibility of ACNTs, SWNTs and Pt was confirmed during cell culturing experiments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/14</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of electro materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Yao, Yueping</field><field name="description">Lithium-ion batteries (or rechargeable lithium batteries) are most advanced battery technology for modern portable electronics such as mobile phones, notebook computers and cameracorders. There are also big potentials for lithium-ion batteries to be used for electric vehicles (EVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and stationary power storage. In particular, the later will bring a significant contribution to reduce green-house gas emissions and address global warming and climate change. Materials research plays a key role in the development of next generation of advanced lithium-ion batteries with high energy density, high power density, and long cycle life.This PhD thesis describes my exploration on developing new anode materials and cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. I firstly investigated silicon based anode materials since silicon has the highest theoretical lithium storage capacity of about 4200 mAh/g when forming Li21Si5 alloys. The reversible lithium storage mechanism is totally different from that of graphite based anode. It relies on a process called alloying and dealloying instead of intercalation and de-intercalation. However, the formation of Li21Si5 alloys can induce more than 400% volume expansion. The repeated expansion and shrinkage of the silicon electrode will cause cracking and eventually failure of the battery system. A general strategy has been employed to solve this problem. Firstly nanosize silicon powders were used to minimize the volume expansion in local domains. Secondly, silicon particles were embedded in carbon matrix to buffer the volume change during the reaction with lithium. Si-mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) composite anode materials were produced by ball-milling. Si-MCMB composite electrodes demonstrated superior performance (high capacity and satisfactory cyclability), compared to bare MCMB and bare nano-Si electrodes. Silicon-amorphous carbon composite anode materials were also prepared by carbon aerogel method, through which nanosize silicon particles are homogeneous distributed in carbon matrix. A reversible capacity of 1450 mAh/g for Si-C composite anodes was achieved. The good cyclability should be attributed to the usage of nanosize Si powders and their homogeneous distribution in an amorphous carbon matrix.Carbon nanotubes have many unique and intriguing properties, including as anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Vertically aligned multiwalled carbon nanotubes (VAMWCNTs) were prepared by chemical vapor deposition method. Nanosize SnO2-MWCNTs composites were also synthesized. The VAMWCNTs have a typical diameter of several tens of nanometers and consist of compartment structures. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the carbon nanotubes are electrochemically active to lithium insertion and extraction. A reversible lithium storage capacity of 950 mAh/g has been achieved for CNTs anodes. The solution-based chemical process enables Sn2+ ions to penetrate into the inner cavity of the carbon nanotubes. The SnO2-CNTs composite electrodes exhibited stable cyclability with a lithium storage capacity of 410 mAh/g after fifty cycles. Transition metal phosphides such as MnP4 and Zn3P2 were discovered to exhibit interesting phenomena with respect to reversible lithium storage. They were conventionally synthesized by solid state sintering at high temperature for long periods. After sintering, the products were purified by acid etching, which is a very tedious process. Crystalline iron phosphide (FeP4) powders were directly prepared by a solvothermal synthesis technique. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated the reversible reactivity of FeP4 anodes towards lithium insertion and extraction. The FeP4 anode exhibited a stable lithium storage capacity about 700 mAh/g.Lithium iron phosphate has been emerging as a new cathode material for lithium-ion batteries with low cost. However, lithium iron phosphate has a very lost electronic conductivity, inducing low rate capacity and preventing commercial application. Various cation dopings have been studied with the goal to improve the overall electrochemical performance of lithium iron phosphate. The synthesis, crystal structure refinement, magnetic and electrochemical properties of a series of LiMnxFe1-xPO4 cathode materials was investigated. A number of conductive phosphides and manganese phosphates were found to be formed during the sintering process with the effect of enhancing the electronic conductivity of the materials. The effect of sintering temperature towards the crystal size of LiFePO4 and Li0.95Mg0.05PO4 compounds were systematically investigated. LiFePO4 and Li0.95Mg0.05PO4 samples exhibit a typical antiferromagnetic behaviour. This antiferromagnetism could be induced by long range Fe-O-P-O-Fe triple exchange due to the lack of direct Fe-O-Fe interactions. LiFePO4 and Li0.95Mg0.05PO4 electrodes show specific capacity in the range 150 mAh/g &#8211; 160 mAh/g.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/88</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual manipulation</field><field name="creator">Dong, Shen</field><field name="description">An empirical research on developing a new paradigm for programming a robotics manipulator to perform complex constrained motion tasks is carried out in this thesis. The teaching of the manipulation skills to the machine commences by demonstrating those skills in a haptic-rendered virtual environment. This is in contrast to conventional approach in which a robotics manipulator is programmed to perform a particular task. A manipulation skill consists of a number of basic skills that, when sequenced and integrated, can perform a desired manipulation task. By manipulation means the ability to transfer, physically transform or mate a part with another part. Haptic-rendering augments the effectiveness of computer simulation by providing force feedback for the user. This increases the quality of human &#65293; computer interaction and provides an attractive augmentation to visual display and significantly enhances the level of immersion in a virtual environment. The study is conducted based on the peg-in-hole application as it concisely represents a constrained motion-force-sensitive manufacturing task with all the attendant issues of jamming, tight clearances, and the need for quick assembly times, reliability, etc. The state recognition approach is used to identify and classify the skills acquired from the virtual environment. A human operator demonstrates both good and bad examples of the desired behaviour in the haptic virtual environment. Position and contact force and torque ii data, as well as orientation generated in the virtual environment, combined with a priori knowledge about the task, are used to identify and learn the skills in the newly demonstrated tasks and then to reproduce them in the robotics system. The robot evaluates the controller&#8217;s performance and thus learns the best way to produce that behaviour. The data obtained from the virtual environment is classified into different cluster sets using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Fuzzy Gustafson&#8211;Kessel (FGK) and Competitive Agglomeration (CA) respectively. Each cluster represents a contact state between the peg and the hole. The clusters in the optimum cluster set are tuned using a Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) algorithm to produce prediction models for robot trajectory performing the physical assembly based on the force/position information received from the rig. The significance of the work is highlighted. The approach developed and the outcomes achieved are reported. The development of the haptic-rendered virtual peg-in-hole model and structure of the physical experimental rig are described. The approach is validated though experimental work results are critically evaluated.

The social interactive experience of DVE users can be greatly enhanced if the users feel immersed in a realistic environment via high fidelity visual scenes, auditory scenes and haptics. While recognising the primary role played by the visual scenes and the consequent rapid progresses made in the field of computer graphics, in this thesis, we investigate the network delivery of live DVE user voices which will be an important supplement to the primary visual scenes in creating the sense of immersion for the DVE users. The Immersive Voice over IP (VoIP) service is characterised by the creation of an auditory scene for each user which is the personalised mix of all the voices within that user&#8217;s hearing range. Each constituent voice stream in an auditory scene is localised (directional placement) and distance-attenuated in accordance with the visual positions of corresponding users in the virtual world. We believe the auditory scenes created for Immersive VoIP will be much more conducive to the creation of users&#8217; sense of immersion than the currently prevalent text-chat and mono VoIP applications. During our literature review, we first identified three key challenges faced by the Immersive VoIP service provider, i.e., the need to reduce respectively, the voice processing cost, the voice exchange bandwidth cost and the voice transmission latency. In view of the limited resources onboard the DVE clients (especially the wireless clients), the concept of server-rendered Immersive VoIP service is proposed which employs dedicated servers to complete the computationally expensive voice rendering tasks on behalf of the clients. Nevertheless, in exchange for the minimisation of client-side resource loads, a server processing scalability problem is created where each of the Auditory Scene Creation (ASC) servers could bear a prohibitively large processing load when supporting a large and dense user population. In the course of conducting subjective listening tests, we soon realised that the further away a listener is from the voice source, the greater is the voice localisation error which can be tolerated by the listener. This important result verifies the conjecture of distance-governed variable ii Abstract iii acceptable_localisation_error which allows the same localised voice to be shared between nearby listening users. This conjecture allows for siginifcant reductons in voice processing cost through the computational reuse of voice localisation results. In addition to considering the static Auditory Scene Creations, a mechanism known as the Transitional Deviation Reduction Algorithm has also been devised to address the issue that the Immersive VoIP users can be annoyed by more than 5 degrees of angular shifts between the voices localised at successive time instants with respect to the same speaking avatar. To ensure low voice latency for the latency-critical Immersive VoIP service, we propose a two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture. In this architecture, the voice transmission path between any pair of communicating avatars is always two overlay hops, i.e., from the speaking client to the assigned ASC server (1st hop) then from the ASC server to the listening client (2nd hop). As shown by our simulations results, this two_overlay_hops distributed server architecture is capable of significantly improving the voice transmission latency from the central server architecture and the prior distributed server solution devised in (Nguyen, 2006), especially for the challenging, yet realistic DVE scenario where there is a low level of correlations between the distribution of avatars in the DVE virtual world and the distribution of physical clients in the underlying geographically dispersed network. The objective of our server selection/assignment Linear Programming (LP) formulations is to obtain a balance between improving the voice transmission latency and mitigating the associated increases in the client-side voice upload bandwidth cost and the server-side voice processing cost. In particular, the Bandwidth Constrained Formulation reduces the client-side voice upload cost while still achieving a satisfactory level of latency performance by establishing a few ASC server sites which are very Latency Efficient, i.e., capable of meeting the acceptable_latency_constraints of a large number of communicating avatar pairs. However, the LP-based server assignment formulations were proven to be NP-hard and computationally expensive if executed in their original centralised format. Consequently, an alternative scheme was devised to divide the virtual world into equal size (measured in the number of avatar pairs enclosed) partitions so as to parallelise and distribute the execution of the server assignment formulations between different partitions. We examined the impact of avatar mobility in the virtual world on the performance of our distributed server assignment solutions, in particular the solution&#8217;s ability to balance Abstract iv between improving the voice latency and reducing the associated rises in client-side upload bandwidth cost. In our simulations, we found that the ASC servers need to be re-assigned at a regular frequency. Despite the significant scalability improvements made by our virtual world partitioning scheme, the optimised server assignment formulations, especially the complex, yet practical Bandwidth Constrained Formulation is still not scalable enough to meet the execution frequencies required for coping with avatar mobility. To this end, we have derived the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic which offers much faster execution time than the optimal server assignment mechanism, at the expense of small performance loss in terms of both latency and client-side upload bandwidth cost. By combining our virtual world partitioning scheme with the Bandwidth Reduced Heuristic, we have produced a distributed server assignment solution which will enable the Immersive VoIP service to cope with frequent virtual world mobility for a wide range of DVE scenarios in terms of varying user population sizes and/or distribution densities. The only exception is a very sparse DVE which could require the ASC servers to be reassigned once per 60-70 seconds. Such a fast frequency is unrealistic considering the combined delays of server reassignment and handover. Consequently, a really sparse DVE with low intensity communication flows is probably best served by a simple Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture with minimum management overhead rather than the client-server architectures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/806</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"By diggers defended, by Victorians mended": searching for Villers Bretonneux</field><field name="creator">Wade, Linda</field><field name="description">When Allan Griffin, Minister for Veterans&#8217; Affairs, stood in front of the Australian National Memorial at Villers Bretonneux on Anzac Day 2008, he told the assembled crowd that the Villers Bretonneux story &#8220;is not as well-known in Australia as it should be&#8221;. He continued that &#8220;our strong connection with the Anzacs at Gallipoli has, over the years, overshadowed our commemoration&#8221; of Villers Bretonneux. Villers Bretonneux is harder to find in Australia&#8217;s memory of war than Gallipoli. But just as Gallipoli holds a sacred place in Australia&#8217;s war memories, Villers Bretonneux has also been imbued with meanings for Australians over the last ninety years. These meanings have changed over time and have both complemented, and jarred with, each other.In 1918, when soldiers of the Australian Imperial Force lived, fought and died around the town of Villers Bretonneux, they formed close relationships with the place and the people there. These relationships stretched out to the Australian home front, so that by war&#8217;s end, Villers Bretonneux had meanings to Australians as a place of military victory, fictive kin, and loss. In the years immediately following the war Villers Bretonneux was figuratively adopted by the city of Melbourne, allowing those Victorians who had already formed an attachment to the area in 1918 to deepen that connection. But as memorials to Australians were constructed at Villers Bretonneux during the interwar years, the town again became a place where different battles were fought. The wartime sacrifices made by school children, and by women, jostled with an official memory which could only see the soldiers&#8217; sacrifice. The personal relationships Australians had formed with Villers Bretonneux were overpowered by the bonds and binds of empire; the ascendancy of a soldier-centric memory evident in the Australian National Memorial, unveiled in 1938, saw Villers Bretonneux lose the resonance it had held for Australians during the 1920s. The Twinning of Villers Bretonneux with Robinvale in Victoria during the 1980s showed how complete that lack of resonance had become. Alan Griffin&#8217;s speech, however, shows that Villers Bretonneux has begun to recover a place in Australia&#8217;s war memories, one based on personal and private meanings. It aptly reflects the notion of a journey in search of Villers Bretonneux, which is the guiding metaphor for this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/796</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating student outcomes from a service learning project</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Shona</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of a group of 15 and 16 year old school students who participated in a service learning project, referred to as the &#8216;Adopt a School&#8217; project. This study was undertaken to understand what effect the project had on these students, and how it impacted on them as people. This study focused on the experiences these students had during their field trip in Sri Lanka in September 2005. A qualitative methodology incorporating the grounded theory was selected to analyse the data.The study identified that service learning engagement provides powerful and deep learning experiences which encourage students to reflect on their beliefs, attitudes and relationships with others, especially on their life as teenagers in Australia and, as a result, what they had come to take for granted or have not questioned.A core finding from this study was that service learning involvement promoted identity formation. Immersion in the host community facilitated new and more complex thinking about their personal and social identities, the construction of identity in relation to serving others, and the kinds of commitments participants wanted to make in their lives. Because students were introduced to and developed relationships with, individuals and experiences with which they were unfamiliar, previously held notions of self and other were challenged, and reconstructed. Implications for education have been drawn from the results of this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/820</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initiation of invasive disease in M1T1 group A streptococcus</field><field name="creator">Hollands, Andrew</field><field name="description">Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus; GAS) is an important human pathogen that colonizes epithelial and mucosal surfaces. Group A streptococcal disease can be relatively minor, such as streptococcal pharyngitis, or severe and life-threatening, such as necrotizing fasciitis. There has been a resurgence of severe infection with GAS since the mid-1980s that has been paralleled be the emergence of a globally disseminated clone, M1T1. The M1T1 clone of GAS presents as the most common cause of streptococcal pharyngitis in developed countries and are also overrepresented in cases of severe infection. Most invasive bacterial infections are caused by species that more commonly colonize the human host with minimal or no symptoms. Although phenotypic or genetic correlates underlying a bacterium&#8217;s shift to enhanced virulence potential have been studied, the in vivo selection pressures governing such shifts are poorly understood. The globally disseminated M1T1 clone of GAS is linked with the rare but life-threatening syndromes of necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Mutations in the group A streptococcal control of virulence regulatory sensor kinase (covR/S) operon are associated with severe invasive disease, abolishing expression of a broad spectrum cysteine protease (SpeB) and allowing the recruitment and activation of host plasminogen on the bacterial surface. This study describes how a bacteriophage-encoded group A streptococcal DNase (Sda1), which facilitates the pathogen&#8217;s escape from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), can serve as a selective force for covR/S mutation. The results provide a paradigm whereby horizontal gene transfer and natural selection exerted by the innate immune system iv generate hypervirulent bacterial variants with increased risk of systemic dissemination. This study sought to investigate if there was a cost of fitness associated with covR/S mutation that counterbalances the dramatic increase in virulence. It was found that covR/S mutant bacteria had reduced capacity to bind fibronectin and collagen, both components of the extracellular matrix bound by streptococcal adhesins. The covR/S mutant strain examined in this study also showed reduced capacity to bind to epithelial cell layers as a consequence of increased capsule expression. This mutant strain displayed reduced capacity to form biofilms. An animal model of skin colonization was used to show that the covR/S mutant strain has a colonization defect. This reduced capacity to colonize presents an explanation as to why hypervirulent covR/S mutant M1T1 group A streptococci are not rapidly spread amongst the community. The role of SpeB in the course of infection is still unclear. This study utilized a SpeB-negative M1T1 clinical isolate, 5628, with a naturally occurring mutation in the gene encoding the regulator RopB, to elucidate the role of RopB and SpeB in systemic virulence. Allelic exchange mutagenesis was used to replace the mutated ropB allele in 5628 with the intact allele from the well characterized isolate 5448. The inverse allelic exchange was also performed to replace the intact ropB in 5448 with the mutated allele from 5628. An intact ropB was found to be essential for SpeB expression. While the ropB mutation was shown to have no effect on haemolysis of RBCs, extracellular DNase activity or survival in the presence of neutrophils, strains with the mutated ropB allele were less virulent in murine systemic models of v infection. An isogenic SpeB knockout strain containing an intact RopB showed similarly reduced virulence. Microarray analysis found genes of the SpeB operon to be the primary target of RopB regulation. These data show that an intact RopB and efficient SpeB production are necessary for systemic infection with GAS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3070</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Standardization and Adaptation of Knowledge Processes in International Businesses</field><field name="creator">Ang, Zhiyi</field><field name="description">There is an ongoing debate on whether standardization or adaptation is more appropriate in international business. Knowledge Management is a relatively new discipline compared to other disciplines. In other disciplines such as strategy, marketing and human resource management there are well-developed theories on standardization and adaptation. This means that forces for standardization and adaptation were well developed in these disciplines. In the current literature for knowledge management, most of them had concentrated on factors affecting knowledge management. Most of the current literature appears to ignore the effects of differences in countries. There are arguments on both sides on whether standardization or adaptation is more appropriate for international knowledge management. From the current literature there are four types of outcomes that can occur from international knowledge management which are appropriate standardization, appropriate adaptation, inappropriate standardization and inappropriate adaptation. However there is a lack of research and study on factors affecting the standardization and adaptation of international knowledge management. There is also lack of research on differences between the firms with the four different types of standardization and adaptation outcomes.Much of the arguments about adaptation in international knowledge management had focused on cross-cultural knowledge management, which focused on the effects of national culture on knowledge management. There is also a substantial amount of research on factors affecting knowledge creation and knowledge transfer. Thus this research is also interested in finding out how differences in national culture could affect the knowledge creation and the knowledge transfer process. It is also interested in finding out how differences in national culture would affect factors that are important for knowledge creation and knowledge transfer.For methodology this research has chosen to use a case study approach. Although both qualitative and quantitative questions were used in the survey, greater emphasis has been placed on using a qualitative approach. Thirty-one respondents were used in this research and they consist of respondents from various countries. Theoretical sampling was used and only firms with an overseas subsidiary were selected. The responses were gathered by a variety of means which includes interviews from phones, emails, interview in person. Some of the findings for this research include the following:1) Forces for standardization include Global Strategy, centralized organization structure, organization culture and creative chaos, standardized approach towards international business, pressure for cost reduction, risk reduction, Industry of the organization, knowledge management is a new idea, minimal differences in national culture and national culture of headquarters.2) Forces for adaptation include Transnational or Multidomestic strategy, decentralized organization structure, adapted approach towards international business and differences in national culture.3) Differences in national culture have different effects on the knowledge creation process and the knowledge transfer process. Differences in national culture have the greatest effect on the knowledge creation process, Step 1: Sharing Tacit Knowledge. For the knowledge transfer process, differences in national culture had the greatest effect on Step 2: Implementation.4) Some of the differences between the four different outcomes from standardization and adaptation are likely to be caused by differences in national culture and the firm&#8217;s level of adaptation for the knowledge creation and knowledge transfer process.5) Differences in national culture had an effect on factors affecting knowledge creation which are Care, managing conversations and job rotation. Job Rotation and the management of expatriates had an effect on the factors that are important for knowledge transfer. Some of the factors affecting knowledge transfer that are affected by differences in national culture include leadership, human resource management practices, absorptive capacity, source transfer capacity and desirability of Knowledge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/573</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal history and geological controls on the distribution of coal seam gases in the southern Sydney Basin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Faiz, Mohinudeen Mohamed</field><field name="description">Coal seams of the southern Sydney Basin contain large volumes of gas, mainly methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (C02) with subordinate volumes of longer chain hydrocarbons (C2+) and nitrogen (Nz). Data from exploration boreholes, underground mines and laboratory sorption-desorption tests are used to investigate the composition and distribution of gases in the coal seams. The influences of thermal history, coal composition, rank, geological structure, stratigraphy and igneous activity are evaluated.The coals of the Late Permian lllawarra Coal Measures attained ranks of up to medium- and low volatile bituminous coals as a result of high palaeo-heat flows (up to 2.5 HFU) and deep burial (up to 2500 m) in the Cretaceous. During the interval between Early Triassic and Middle Jurassic, large volumes of COz and H20 and subsidiary amounts of hydrocarbons were generated by coalification. The major phase of CH4 and other hydrocarbon generation occurred between the Middle Jurassic and Late Cretaceous at burial depths between 1.5 krn and 2.5 km.The gas retention and emission characteristics of coals are primarily dependent on pore-size distribution. The Permian coals studied composed of mostly vitrinite and inertinite and the porosity of these coals is dominated by micro- and meso-pores &#171; 50 nm). Pores associated with the mineral matter are mainly macro-pores (&gt; 50 nm) hence the presence of mineral matter in coal relatively decreases its micro-porosity.The gas sorption in coals mainly occurs in the micro-pores and increases with fixed carbon content, vitrinite reflectance and content but decreases with increasing mineral matter, volatile matter and moisture content. The CO2 sorption capacity of coal is between two to three times higher than that for C~. Coal also desorbs CO2 at a significantly higher rate than CH4&#8226; For a given gas, the desorption rates are related to the abundance of macro-pores and fractures and accordingly increases with mineral matter and vitrinite content. Hence the residual gas content decreases with the increasing COz, mineral matter and vitrinite content.CH4 and longer chain hydrocarbons presently occurring within the Illawarra Coal Measures were generated during coalification, whereas most of the COz was introduced into the sequence in association with the periodic igneous activity since the Middle Jurassic. Most of the CO2 generated during the early stages of coalification have been expelled from the coal measures.  The variations in the gas composition are mainly related to structural features and depth; the volume of CO2 increases towards structural highs with highest concentration occurring in anticlines and near some faults. Structural lows contain dominantly CH4 but local pockets of CO2 sometimes occur adjacent to faults and dykes. Furthermore, in majority of the boreholes, the volume of CO2 increases with decreasing depth. These variations are mainly related to the migration and solubility properties of CO2.The quantity of ethane and longer chain hydrocarbons occurring at depths less than 500m is very small &#171; 0.1%) but increases with depth. It is postulated that this trend is related to theready expulsion of most of the early-formed longer chain hydrocarbons from shallow depths and the subsequent invasion by later-formed CH4.The total in-situ gas content of coal, measured from core desorption test, varies from &lt; 1 m'It to 20 m3/t. The desorbable gas content at depths shallower than 200 m is negligible but, on average, increases by approximately 4 m'It per 100m in increase depth up to 600 m, and thereafter the rate of increases is significantly low. However, at a given depth, individual values can show up to 80% variability depending on gas composition, geological structure, coal composition and rank. Elevated gas contents occur where the gas is dominantly CO2 whereas anomalously low gas contents occur near highly faulted zones.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/346</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient topology control algorithms for ad hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Srivastava, Gaurav</field><field name="description">An Ad-hoc network is a collection of devices equipped with computing and wire- less communication capabilities, co-operating together to form a network. An ad-hoc node can communicate with other nodes within its transmission range, or use intermediate nodes to establish communication paths to nodes outside its transmission range. Intermediate nodes in a route can collaborate to act as routers and forward their own traffic as well as the traffic generated by other nodes in a network. This strategy of routing is different to wired networks were communication is made possible through specialised networking devices includ- ing hubs, switches and routers interconnecting Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs). The routers used in LANs and WANs are devices with large processing capabilities, and high speed communication links. The topology of a network consists of a set of links and nodes which are used to discover and maintain communication paths and assist in coordinating the flow of packets in a network. The topology information can be used for many purposes including evaluating the connectivity/bi-connectivity of a topology and construction of routing paths for network applications. Nodes generally rely on each other to acquire topology information. Topology information can be disseminated by one centralized node by using a specialised process known as &#8216;flooding&#8217; or can also be disseminated in a distributed manner by broadcasting partial link state information and generating local topology views. Such local views can be put together to generate a larger topology view of a network. Topology control is defined as a process where the topology of a network can be controlled by selective addition of nodes and links within a network. This process of selective addition can significantly impact the power usage and con- nectivity of network devices and improve longevity of a wireless network. In this thesis we analyse the impact of topology control and propose new algorithms and strategies that improve the connectivity, fault tolerance and communica- tion reliability of topology graphs. We review, classify, categorise existing lit- erature and discuss problems and issues associated with topology construction and maintenance proposed with and without Global Positioning System (GPS) aided techniques. Distributed topology control algorithms proposed for constructing minimum node degree graphs [Bettstetter, 2002] including K-Neigh [Blough et al., 2003], Location Information No Topology (LINT) [Ramanathan and Rosales-Hain, 2000], Location Information Link State Topology (LILT) [Ramanathan and Rosales-Hain, 2000] and MobileGrid (MG) [Liu and Li, 2002], do not necessarily generate bidirec- tional connected topology graphs and may result in isolated nodes and discon- nected clusters. Such isolated nodes and disconnected clusters affect the overall connectivity of a network. The bidirectional connectivity of a network is an im- portant factor in order to determine its performance. A &#8216;bidirectional connected&#8217; network, generally known as a connected network, is able to provide access to all crucial parts of a network and allows delivery of applications through a net- work. The bidirectional links are critical as they facilitate two way communica- tion between the transmitter and receiver nodes. We proposed two mechanisms, Collaborative Algorithm (CA) [Srivastava et al., 2004a] and Probable Critical Links (PCL) [Srivastava et al., 2004d] to improve the connectivity of minimum node degree graphs and analyse their performance [Srivastava et al., 2006].Power aware topology graphs use low power communications in order to reduce the overall power consumption of network nodes. A power optimised topology graph reduces the total number of links in the topology graph by eliminating long distance links and replacing them with a number of small links. Removing links in a network topology can impact the fault tolerance of a network. Fault tolerance of a network is the ability of a network to cope with link and node failures. We analyse the fault tolerance issues related to power aware topology graphs including Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) [Prim, 1957] and Relative Neighbourhood graphs (RNG) [Huang et al., 2002]. We propose Link Redun- dancy (LR) algorithm [Srivastava et al., 2005a] to improve the fault tolerance of topology control algorithms. We analyse the performance of LR through worked examples and simulations [Srivastava et al., 2005a]. The LR algorithms yields a higher fault tolerant topology as opposed to the distance based approaches where link selections are made on the basis of the separation distance and may not necessarily yield a higher degree of connectivity [Srivastava et al., 2005a]. Power control also allows nodes to improve the spatial reuse of a wireless channel by reducing interference on other network communications and allowing nodes to communicate simultaneously. We analyse the spatial reuse issues related to topology graphs which can limit the performance of the algorithms due to the presence of hidden nodes [Poon and Li, 2003]. We propose Distributed Range Assignment (DRA) algorithm [Srivastava et al., 2004b] to reduce the hidden nodes in a network topology. We and apply DRA to MST and RNG topology graphs and analyse their performance through worked examples and simulations [Srivastava et al., 2004b]. The distance based topology graphs including MST, RNG, K-Neigh, and CA- PCL [Srivastava et al., 2006] do not model obstacles in a network. The con- nectivity of distance based topology graphs can be severely limited due to the presence of obstacles as nodes alter transmission range on the basis of the sep- aration distance of links. Including signal attenuation characteristics can con- struct an accurate view of a network. We analyse the disconnected nature of distance based topology graphs under Lognormal-shadowing [Cox et al., 1984] [Cox et al., 1987] signal attenuation model. The Lognormal-shadowing model is used to analyse the impact of signal strength variations due to shadowing and scattering on the connectivity of power based topology graphs. We propose CA [Srivastava et al., 2006] in conjunction with the with power based topology graphs to improve the connectivity of a network [Srivastava et al., 2005b].</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/718</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual model of information system implementation within organisations</field><field name="creator">Matthias, Thomas Michael</field><field name="description">Information technology (IT) enabled information systems (IS) are widely used within most organisations today. Since the introduction of IT enabled IS in the 1980&#8217;s, there have been numerous reports of problematic and failed implementations. The implementation stage has been emphasised as the stage in the IS life cycle where a large number of issues arise, and the implementation phenomenon has been widely studied. Despite this research focus, there is still not a consensus within the IS research community about what factors lead to implementation failure, and what factors facilitate implementation success. There are many studies that examine the use of IS through models of user behaviour, typically focussing on explaining the variance of a particular variable such as usage frequency. Two such studies raised questions that were important in framing this thesis. Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, G. and Davis, F. (2003) asked whether or not efforts put into understanding factors that contribute to increased usage actually help predict IS success, and to what degree systems considered to have been successfully adopted are actually successful from an organisational perspective. Jasperson, Carter and Zmud (2005) suggested that research should look further than simple dependent variables such as usage, and that uptake of system features might be a better indicator of implementation success. Further, it was suggested that the implementation outcome might be influenced by behaviours and factors that occurred after the installation of IS, and that few models of implementation actually contained a post-adoptive stage. In order to answer these and other questions concerning the implementation of IS within organisations, a longitudinal, qualitative study of the implementation of an enterprise wide IS within an organisation was conducted using the ethnographic methodology of participant observation. The focus of the study was the impact of individual and group behaviour on the implementation success of IS. This focus necessitated exploration of the concept of implementation success, its measurement and how implementation success is perceived throughout an organisation. An important outcome from this study was a Conceptual Model of Information System Implementation within Organisations (CMISIO). The CMISIO, based upon observations from the study, describes implementation as a multi-faceted phenomenon guided within organisational constraints to achieve a pre-determined organisational fit. Organisational fit captures the notion of success, which was seen to vary depending upon the perspective of an observer within the organisation. In this way implementation success was seen to be a multi-faceted phenomenon. The intent of the model was not to reduce the implementation phenomenon to components, but rather to capture those organisational factors that lead to site-specific variations in IS implementation. There were a number of important findings from the study that have relevance for both IS researchers and practitioners. The IS implementation process can take much longer than is widely reported. Studies that only focus upon a part of the process might fail to capture salient factors that are important in the overall implementation outcome. Evidence to support the importance of Jasperson et al.&#8217;s (2005) adoption phase, as well as a later phase of adaptation was found. Adaptation, where organisational users adapt the new IS to their particular needs, can take months or years, and a lack of organisational support within this phase can lead to eventual implementation failure. An IS within an organisation is only special for a certain time, and management focus can shift before the implementation process has been completed. The organisational climate that exists at the time of implementation provides constraints that IS project teams must recognise and work within. Elements of the organisation&#8217;s culture can also be important factors in understanding motivations behind behaviours that may be either supportive of or detrimental to the implementation. The study found evidence that some behaviours seen as negative towards the IS implementation were likely motivated by psychological reactance (Brehm, 1966), where individuals react to real or perceived threats to their organisational freedom. The reactance was generated by factors not just associated with the IS, and this finding suggests that in order to predict the implementation outcome within an organisation it is necessary to understand factors other than those directly associated with the IS being implemented. Finally, the scientist-practitioner model used within psychology was suggested as a working model that could be used to help integrate the large body of IS research into organisations. The model focuses on the integration of science-based research and day-to-day practice whereby each informs the other through involvement. This proposal addresses a perceived gap between the researchers looking at IS on the one hand and practitioners implementing IS within organisations on the other.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3052</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The significance of language for accounting theory and methodology</field><field name="creator">Nasseri, Ahmad</field><field name="description">The significance of language for accounting theory and methodology is investigated and discussed through three different approaches. First, linguistic analyses of accounting language declare that some difficulties and misunderstandings in accounting are grounded in language and linguistics. The relevance of linguistics to accounting is examined through analysing a number of Iranian accounting terminology cases (e.g. hesaabdaaree, sarghoflee, etc.). It is shown that improving accounting theory and practice necessitates considering its linguistics. The linguistic significance of language on accounting is that, without considering language and linguistic problems, misunderstandings and difficulties are drawn into accounting. Translation, ambiguity, and acronyms are introduced as the most effective linguistic problems that produce difficulties within accounting. Secondly, philosophical investigations reveal that identifying accounting [as well as any other human knowledge] is entirely related to language. A philosophical foundation is established through criticising Frege&#8217;s definition of thought, idea, truth, and falsity. It is argued that truth and falsity, contrary to what Frege argues, have different natures and thus different methods of inquiry. It is explained how the dangerous similarity of truth and falsity is a matter of language and how language trammels true meaning and false meaning into the same trap. The philosophical criticism results in a multidimensional explication of accounting. The three main dimensions of accounting are empirical, critical, and hermeneutical accounting. The singular definitions, generalisation, and boundary presumptions of accounting theory are consequently criticised.Finally, hermeneutical accounting is studied historically to explore the presence of language in accounting. Hermeneutics has found several different readings through time. The implications of divergent readings of hermeneutics in accounting are examined through reviewing the accounting literature. It is revealed that very few accounting contributors have so far considered the interpretive aspect of knowledge. The few hermeneutical explanations of accounting which do exist nevertheless, declare that accounting is a text which requires interpretation. This thesis totally adds value of the existing body of accounting theory by introducing and examining linguistic problems that cause difficulties and misunderstandings within accounting, analysing two problematic cases of Iranian accounting terminology and thus evidencing the relevance of a linguistic approach to accounting, explaining the dangers and difficulties arising from acronyms within accounting, criticising Frege&#8217;s philosophy and concluding that true thoughts are different in nature and method of inquiry with false thoughts and then discussing that accounting and all human knowledge as they are intended to be true thoughts but not false ones are to be discovered and not created, identifying accounting as a multidimensional knowledge, and finally explaining the hermeneutical dimension of accounting through an historical analysis. The thesis entirely approaches empirical, critical, and historical analyses to announce that language plays a crucial role in theorising and practicing accounting. It is evidentially emphasised that dismissing language and linguistic problems of accounting weakens accounting theory and methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/75</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of water-droplet impact on hot galvanised steel surfaces</field><field name="creator">Bierbrauer, Frank</field><field name="description">Hot-dip galvanising is commonly used in industry to increase the corrosion resistance of cold-rolled steel products for commercial use such as roofing and walling of buildings.  Traditionally, the zinc coated steel surface is characterised by a relatively smooth surface with large spangle relief which is detrimental to corrosion resistance. One of the techniques to modify the surface appearance consists of a water-mist spray solution which allows for the creation of a large number of nucleation sites giving rise to micro rather than macro spangles, thereby producing a much smoother surface. In addition, controlling the spray parameters allows the hot, zinc coated, steel surface to be &#8216;roughened&#8217; facilitating its bonding to concrete or for lamination. The proper control of water droplet impact parameters such as impact velocity, droplet diameter and crater size is essential for a successful implementation of this technique. Certain aspects of the second of these processes, the production of rough, non-skid galvanised steel sheet surfaces, has been addressed by this thesis.Although an experimental investigation of the effect of such water droplet parameters on the formation of zinc surface characteristics such as crater diameter and depth would provide a great deal of valuable data it is fraught with difficulties. The presence of hot metal surfaces exceeding 450oC and the boiling and evaporation of water droplets taking place at very small timescales (microseconds) all combine to make an experimental study difficult to implement not to say unsafe. On the other hand computer simulations with a properly constructed mathematical model are a valuable tool for the investigation of these parameters.A comprehensive modelling of the process would include the process of heat transfer: such as conduction through a vapour layer, internal droplet and vapour convection, radiation from the hot surface, solidification of the zinc liquid layer; as well as the fluid dynamical aspects: such as surface tension at the droplet-air, droplet-zinc and zinc-air interfaces, the droplet impact phenomena such as spreading and splashing and the formation of impact craters and wave propagation in a thin viscous zinc layer. As a first stage in the modelling exercise this thesis will concentrate on an investigation of single water droplet impact on a thin liquid zinc layer with a steel substrate which provides a simplified and computationally tractable model of the spraying process.The objectives of this thesis are twofold: firstly, the development and construction of an accurate, robust mathematical model and, secondly, the solution of the model for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid layer of zinc on a steel substrate. This model must be able to deal with rapidly deforming moving interfaces and maintain stability in the presence of very large density and viscosity ratios. This moving boundary problem requires the tracking of three fluid interfaces while also maintaining incompressibility. The Godunov-Marker-Particle Projection Scheme developed in this thesis is able to satisfy these requirements. Through a combination of approximate projection methods, Godunov convective differencing, Marker-Particle interface tracking and velocity filters the method is able to treat viscous, multi-fluid free surface flows. The modelling of free surface flows with more than two separate immiscible fluids, to the author&#8217;s knowledge not yet published in the literature, is a secondary aim of the thesis. A major part of the thesis deals with the thorough testing of each aspect of the combination of numerical methods used: firstly, the Poisson solver with discontinuous coefficients and homogeneous boundary conditions used in the approximate projection method, analytical solutions for the construction of an initial solenoidal velocity field, testing of the projection and velocity filters and kinematic tests of the Marker-Particle method for tracking of fluid interfaces; secondly, dynamical tests of the viscous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for: an exact solution, the Lid-Driven Cavity and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The combined method is also successfully tested on the limited two-fluid droplet-solid and droplet-liquid impact problems before solving the thesis problem.It is shown that, for the impact of a single water droplet onto a thin liquid zinc layer, impact crater growth, diameter and depth, are linearly dependent on impact velocity. For a given impact velocity, crater diameter is not effected by increasing zinc layer depth although crater depth is linearly dependent. The time at which the droplet commences penetration of the zinc layer is inversely dependent on impact velocity and the maximum crater diameter and depth are nonlinearly dependent on impact velocity. The model shows that, within the convective timescale, droplet impact on thin liquid zinc layers can be approximately described by droplet spreading on a solid zinc surface. The droplet is shown to spread preferentially to the zinc layer splashing after completion of spreading. This shows that adjustment of the droplet impact velocity or zinc layer depth can vary the surface roughness appropriately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/400</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improvement of critical current density in MgB2 by optimizing process parameters and chemical doping</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Yun</field><field name="description">The discovery of superconductivity in MgB2 in January 2001 has triggered enormous interest around the world. MgB2 has evolved as a promising superconductor for the next generation of superconductor applications, due to not only its higher critical temperature (Tc = 39 K), low material cost, and good weak-link tolerance, but also its rich multiple-band structure. However, several issues exist that urgently need to be solved, such as its low upper critical field (Hc2) and rapid decrease in critical current density (Jc) under magnetic field compared to Nb-based superconductors. High Jc(H) performance is crucial for the application of this material in the so-called &#8220;strong electrical application&#8221; field. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to increase Jc of bulk polycrystalline MgB2 via studying the influence of the boron precursor powder and the nominal Mg/B mixing ratio and efforts to further enhance Jc by doping with two types of sources: carbon sources (such as SiC and sucrose) and oxygen sources (such as TiO2/SiO2 and processing atmospheres with different oxygen content).The control of the boron powder is one of most promising methods to enhance Jc at high fields without significant decrease of the self-field Jc. The particle size, purity, and form of the starting boron powders play an important role in the superconducting properties of MgB2. It has been proved the precursor B powder is very important to critical current density of MgB2. In terms of the influence of boron precursor on the superconducting properties of MgB2, Jc values for MgB2 made from ball-milled high purity boron powders with crystalline phase are at least two times higher than for a comparable MgB2 sample made from ball-milled amorphous boron powder and a factor of 40 higher than typical values of standard MgB2 samples. The possible mechanism proposed to account for this difference is Hc2 enhancement caused by the increased disorder. Nano-particle SiC is a very effective dopant to improve the in-field Jc of MgB2. However, Jc at lower field become lower than the undoped one. It would be desirable to maintain a high low-field Jc while improve the high field Jc. In order to solve this issue, the influence of Mg content was investigated in a series of undoped and SiC-doped MgB2 samples with systematic variation of the nominal Mg/B ratio (x:2). It has been found that in the undoped MgB2 samples Jc increases with x to a maximum value at x = 1.1 and then decreases. The higher Jc at x = 1.1 is attributed to the better connectivity caused by smaller amounts of impurities. In the SiC-doped samples, it has been found that the sample with x = 1.15 exhibits the best Jc performance for all fields  from 0 &#8211; 8.5 T, including the self-field, and its Tc is higher than for the sample with x = 1. The enhancement of Jc is attributed to the improved connectivity and the increased disorder. The optimized Mg/B ratio (1.15:2) also diminishes the interband scattering caused by the Mg or B vacancies and, in turn, increases Tc.Carbonhydrates such as sucrose can decompose at high emperature. The resulting carbon from the decomposition can be used as carbon source to dope into MgB2. This kind of carbon is very reactive and can be incorporated into MgB2 easier. A comprehensive study of the effects of carbohydrate doping on the superconductivity of MgB2 has been conducted. Doping with sucrose at varying rates and annealing temperatures results in an optimal Jc value in MgB2-xCx at x = 0.2 and 850 oC. At 5 K and 6 T, the x = 0.2 sample shows one order of magnitude improvement compared to pure sample. It has been found that sucrose doping causes a small depression in Tc and high resistivity, while Hc2 performance is improved. The reason for the enhancement of Hc2 is likely to be increased disorder caused by C substitution for B and/or diffusion of C atoms in the MgB2 lattice as interstitial atoms. TiO2/SiO2 additions lead to improved Jc values. Jc values are the highest at the doping ratio of 10 wt% at 5 K and 20 K, and at the doping ratio of 5 wt% at 30 K, when the sintering temperature is fixed at 750 oC. When the doping ratio is fixed at 5 wt%, the sample with the sintering temperature of 750 oC has the best Jc for 5 K and 20 K, while the sample with the sintering temperature of 850 oC exhibits the highest Jc at 30 K. In addition, it has been found that the addition of TiO2/SiO2 nanoparticles results in a small depression in Tc, while the Hc2 and irreversibility field (Hirr) performances are improved. The enhancement of Hc2 and Hirr can be attributed to the existence of precipitates induced by the TiO2/SiO2 doping. The effect of processing atmosphere on microstructure and superconducting properties was studied for MgB2 samples made using the in situ reaction technique under argon atmosphere with three different purities, ultra-high, high, and welding grade. The critical temperature, Tc, decreases by 0.5 K while the FWHM, the resistivity and the amount of MgO show an increase in the welding Ar processed sample. The Jc, Hirr and Hc2 for the welding Ar processed sample are improved in comparison with the samples treated in ultra-high and high purity argon. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) examination revealed that the sample processed in welding grade argon possessed small grains, a high density of defects, and larger crystalline strains, which act as effective pinning centres. These results verify the dual reaction model where the MgB2 formation and the reaction between oxygen and precursor take place simultaneously, resulting in an optimal doping effect. The Jc(H) behaviour for samples treated at 800oC for 60 hours in the sealed Fe tube shows little difference among the three different Ar atmospheres.  The optimal Jc and flux pinning properties in MgB2 can be achieved by using readily available and economical welding grade Ar as the protective atmosphere instead of using ultra-high or high purity Ar. The effects of the sintering time on the superconductivity of MgB2 with sintering in the welding grade Ar atmosphere have been investigated.  The sample sintered for 30 min exhibits the highest Jc at high fields. The reason can be attributed to the improved connectivity and the increased Hc2.Overall, the works in this thesis are mainly on material process and characterization. I have studied many factors such as precursor powder, process parameters, dopants that have strong effects on Jc. The results are useful for future MgB2 fabrications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3060</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthony Mannix: 'The atomic book'</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Gareth Sion</field><field name="description">This thesis is the first and only investigation, academic or otherwise, of the oeuvre of the internationally recognised Australian Outsider Artist Anthony Mannix (1953- ). Virtually unknown as a writer, it is this aspect of his practice that will be the focus of this thesis. The central argument of this thesis is that, whilst Mannix&#8217;s writing displays the extreme level of idiosyncratic thinking commonly associated with the work of Outsider Artists, it retains many traces of the literary, artistic and social environment in which he lives. Such traces are defamiliarised by his experience of schizophrenia and the episodes of psychosis that provide much of the subject matter for his texts. Rational language is refigured by madness in what Mannix calls his &#8220;outsider writing&#8221;. It is argued that such writing presents a dialogue between madness and reason, resisting the propensity (as elucidated by Michel Foucault) of rationality to silence the voice of the insane. Mannix cites the work of Antonin Artaud as influential on his own ideas. This thesis contextualises Mannix&#8217;s point of view in relation to theorists (predominantly post-structuralist and &#8220;anti-psychiatric&#8221;) for whom Artaud was also influential in defining notions of madness. 	Chapter One discusses the construction of &#8216;The Mannix Atomic Book Digital Archive&#8217; (&#8216;The Atomic Book&#8217;), to which this thesis is designed as companion. The archive has been created to facilitate the detailed study of Mannix&#8217;s writing; almost entirely unpublished, such work is predominantly held in singular volumes unavailable to the public. Thus, it is to the archive itself that many of the Mannix quotations discussed by this thesis are referenced. The archive contains digital versions of seventy-two artists&#8217; books (numbering in excess of four thousand pages), sound recordings, a video work and biographical material. Chapters Two and Three discuss Mannix&#8217;s engagement with the central theme of his work, madness. Chapter Two examines the influence of schizophrenia, and particularly psychosis, on Mannix&#8217;s artistic world-view. Here he consciously situates himself within the lineage of Art Brut and Outsider Art as a shamanic figure documenting his own personal unconscious &#8220;cosmology&#8221;.  	Chapter Three discusses Mannix&#8217;s dialogue with psychiatry. Mannix&#8217;s oeuvre, what he terms his &#8220;book of life&#8221;, can be read as a &#8220;speculative narrative&#8221; which counters the rational narratives with which psychiatry has attempted (in over twenty years of contact) to re/write him in a manoeuvre that sees the medical profession characterise the patient as an unreliable narrator of their own experience.	Chapter Four is focused on the second dominant theme within Mannix&#8217;s work: the erotic. Mannix&#8217;s psychotic episodes are often highly erotic in nature and the unconscious landscapes Mannix explores are dominated by erotic happenings and images. It is often through the erotic that Mannix experiences the subject / object confluence characteristic of schizophrenia, and the manner in which art-making facilitates such erotic unions is outlined.	The final two chapters of the thesis, Five and Six, rather than drawing from many works simultaneously, are dedicated to a close engagement with a selection of individual books and creative series produced by Mannix. Here it is the manner in which texts operate as narratives in their own right that is the focus of analysis. Chapter Five discusses the following texts: The Machines, or a Concise History of the Machine (as far as I know them&#8230;)&#8230;.; Erogeny: a book of fables about Rozelle Lunatic Asylum, The Skull, The Chambers and The Demise.	Chapter Six focuses on what Mannix calls his novel, The Light Bulb Eaters. It is within this, his longest written work, that Mannix suggests he most comprehensively sets out his unconscious cosmology. Mannix details his &#8220;schizophrenic trek&#8221;, a journey into the underworld of the unconscious in pursuit of the &#8220;power&#8221; required to take control of the very landscapes through which he moves.  Ultimately, Mannix seeks release from this death-like realm; in order to achieve such a resurrection he must, literally, bring his artwork to life and this becomes the definitive aim of his entire oeuvre.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/89</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of mining subsidence, upsidence and valley closure using UDEC</field><field name="creator">Keilich, Walter</field><field name="description">Ground subsidence due to mining has been the subject of intensive research for several decades, and it remains to be an important topic confronting the mining industry today. In the Southern Coalfield of New South Wales, Australia, there is particular concern about subsidence impacts on incised river valleys &#8211; valley closure, upsidence, and the resulting localised loss of surface water under low flow conditions. Most of the reported cases have occurred when the river valley is directly undermined. More importantly, there are a number of cases where closure and upsidence have been reported above unmined coal. These latter events are especially significant as they influence decisions regarding stand-off distances and hence mine layouts and reserve recovery.The deformation of a valley indicates the onset of locally compressive stress conditions concentrated at the base of the valley. Compressive conditions are anticipated when the surface deforms in a sagging mode, for example directly above the longwall extraction; but they are not expected when the surface deforms in a hogging mode at the edge of the extraction as that area is typically in tension. To date, explanations for valley closure under the hogging mode have considered undefined compressive stress redistributions in the horizontal plane, or lateral block movements and displacement along discontinuities generated in the sagging mode. This research is investigating the possibilities of the block movement model and its role in generating compressive stresses at the base of valleys, in the tensile portion of the subsidence profile. The numerical modelling in this research project has demonstrated that the block movement proposal is feasible provided that the curvatures developed are sufficient to allow lateral block movement. Valley closure and the onset of valley base yield are able to be quantified with the possibility of using analytical solutions.  To achieve this, a methodology of subsidence prediction using the Distinct Element code UDEC has been developed as an alternative for subsidence modelling and prediction for isolated longwall panels. The numerical models have been validated by comparison with empirical results, observed caving behaviour and analytical solutions, all of which are in good agreement. The techniques developed in the subsidence prediction UDEC models have then been used to develop the conceptual block movement model. The outcomes of this research have vast implications. Firstly, it is shown that valley closure and upsidence is primarily a function of ground curvature. Since the magnitude of curvature is directly related to the magnitude of vertical subsidence there is an opportunity to consider changes in the mine layout as a strategy to reduce valley closure. Secondly, with further research there is the possibility that mining companies can assess potential damage to river valleys based on how close longwall panels approach the river valley in question. This has the added advantage of optimising the required stand off distances to river valley and increasing coal recovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/862</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of blind signal separation for real time application</field><field name="creator">Smith, Daniel</field><field name="description">The &#8216;cocktail party problem&#8217; is the term commonly used to describe the perceptual problem experienced by a listener who attempts to focus upon a single speaker in a scene of interfering audio and noise sources. Blind Signal Separation (BSS) is a blind identification approach that can offer an adaptive, intelligent solution to the &#8216;cocktail party problem&#8217;. Audio signals can be blindly retrieved from the mixture, that is, without a priori knowledge of the audio signals or the location of the audio sources and sensors. Hence, BSS exhibits greater flexibility than other identification approaches, such as adaptive beamforming, which require precise knowledge of the sensors and/or signal locations.Speech enhancement is a potential application of BSS. In particular, BSS is potentially useful for the enhancement of speech in interactive voice technologies. However, interactive voice technologies, such as mobile telephony or  eleconferencing, require real time processing (on a frame-by-frame basis), as longer processing delays are considered intolerable for the participants of the two-way communication. Hence, BSS applications with interactive voice technologies require real-time operation of the algorithm.BSS primarily employs Independent Component Analysis (ICA) as the criteria to separate speech signals. Separation is achieved with ICA when statistical independence between the signal estimates is established. However, investigations in this Thesis, that study the relationship between the ICA criteria and speech signals indicate that significant statistical dependencies can exist between short frames of speech. Hence, it was found that the ICA criteria could be unreliable for real-time speech separation. This Thesis proposes a number of BSS algorithms that improve real-time separation performance in acoustic environments. In addition, these algorithms are shown to be better equipped to handle the dynamic nature of acoustic environments that contain moving speakers. The algorithms exhibit higher data efficiency, that is, these approaches accurately separate the acoustic scene with smaller amounts of data. The higher data efficiency is the result of BSS models that better represent the underlying characteristics of audio, and in particular speech in the mixture.Sparse Component Analysis (SCA) algorithms are proposed to exploit the sparse representation of audio in the time-frequency (t-f) domain. Conventional SCA approaches generally place strong constraints upon signals, requiring them to be highly sparse across their entire t-f representation. This constraint is not always satisfied by broadband audio, particularly speech, and hence separation performance is reduced. The SCA algorithms developed in this Thesis relax this constraint, such that signals can be estimated from sparse sub-regions of the t-f representation rather than the complete t-f representation. A SCA algorithm that employs K-means clustering of the t-f space is proposed in order to improve the accuracy of estimation. In addition, an exponential averaging function is used to reduce the influence of poor estimates when separation is performed on a frame by frame basis. Sequential approaches to SCA are proposed in this Thesis where only a sparse subregion of one signal in the mixture is required for estimation at one time. This relaxes the sparsity constraints that are placed upon broadband signals in the mixture.A BSS algorithm that jointly models the production mechanisms of speech (pitch and spectral envelope) is also presented in this Thesis. This produces a more accurate model of speech than existing algorithms that individuallymodel the pitch or spectral envelope. An investigation of this algorithm then determines the parameter set that optimally models the underlying speech signals in the mixture.Finally, an algorithm is proposed to exploit both the sparse t-f representation of audio and the joint model of speech production. This unified approach compares the SCA and speech production mechanism criteria, switching to the criteria that provides the most accurate estimate. Results indicate that this unified algorithm offers a superior data efficiency to its constituent algorithms, and to three benchmark ICA algorithms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/659</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceived usability: foster students interaction through online synchronous chat</field><field name="creator">Lam, Cam Le</field><field name="description">Demand for innovative and accessible Western education throughout Asia has significantly improved the use of online teaching and support tools. Previous research studies of online education have focussed primarily on full online and distance education, and asynchronous tools for fostering communication. Few studies have explored blended learning strategies in an education environment using synchronous tools to support ongoing communication amongst students from South East Asia facilitated by their offshore subject co-ordinator.This qualitative study explores South East Asian students&#8217; attitudes and perceptions to the usability of online synchronous communication and to determine the success of such a tool in fostering communication and supporting group interaction. The study comprises a group of 40 computer science students for Case Study 1 and a class size of 29 students for the second case study undertaking the same subject have agreed to participate in the research.The triangulation method adopted for the two field studies has established that there are interrelationships amongst the three usability constructs in the context of this study. The usability constructs refer to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitudes toward participation.A combination of questionnaires, focus groups and observation techniques have been conducted; and the results show that students&#8217; perception and attitudes are influenced by the multiple and interrelated facets of the online group communication: the human-totechnology interaction, the human-to-human communication, and the capability of the initial studies have elicited the importance of motivation along with connection stability as significant influences on students&#8217; attitudes toward participation. The first case study identified the large group size, the fast speed of the messages posted, and the instability of the technology as key difficulties.A revised methodology was applied to the second case study allowed a more stable environment for evaluating students&#8217; perceptions. A number of underlying interrelating group characteristics and individual attributes including technology and human factors that influence student usability and participation are discussed and presented in Case Study 2.Contrary to the stereotype that Asian students are passive students from a South East Asian background in both case studies have been highly interactive during the online chat sessions. Evidence from the observations and questionnaire feedback showed that all participants contributed to the discussion and were heavily engaged with the live chat sessions. The majority of participants indicated that they value the opportunity to interact with the offshore lecturer, and to receive timely feedback to their queries.According to student perceptions, the findings from the various data collection methods have shown that the medium being easy to use, a less confronting form of communication as well as useful for enhancing communication and learning objectives. Common themes across the two case studies include suggestions for greater clarity and quality of the messages posted; and that the pace of the message flow should not inhibit a student&#8217;s ability to participate in the open dialog. The lack of visual cues means that no movement on the screen can lead to participants concurrently posting messages. This calls for the need to find a balance between too much activity and no activity, which could further improve the quality of participation.Overall evidence from this research suggests that the interaction amongst the students is highly positive. The studies indicate that there is great potential for students from South East Asia to use synchronous chat, under this particular blend of learning, to actively participate and engage in their learning. This research provides a good foundation for further studies to evaluate and improve on the delivery of synchronous online tools</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/698</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon nanotubes and conducting polymer composites</field><field name="creator">Tahhan, May</field><field name="description">A nanocomposite is defined as a material of more than one solid phase, where at least one dimension falls in the nanometer range. The combination of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and conducting polymers offers an attractive route for the production of novel compounds that can be used in a variety of application such as sensors, actuators, and molecular scale electronic devices. The ultimate goal of this work is to develop and investigate CNT composites that provide a structural functionality together with one or more other key functions. A variety of novel CNT dispersions were prepared using commercially available CNT systems such as Rice single-walled carbon nanotubes (RCNT), HiPco single-walled carbon nanotubes (HCNT), and Multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). This study explored the application of novel functional dispersing agents. Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (DNA) a biological molecule, N- sopropylacrylamide 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (NIPPAm-AMPS) a polyelectrolyte, Didodecyldimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB) a polymerizable compound, Poly(methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) an inherently conducting polymer, and PVA an insulating polymer were some of the agents used to disperse the CNT. These dispersions were then evaluated in term of their stability and ability to effectively disperse the CNT. Solid-state CNT composites (mats) were then prepared by means of pressure filtration of the CNT/dispersant solutions. These mats were characterized using a variety of different techniques to determine their viability to be used as mechanical actuators or electrochemical devices. The characterization methods included cyclic voltammetry, conductivity, capacitance, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Young&#8217;s modulus, and actuation measurements. Abstract RCNT/conducting polymer composites were prepared by the electropolymerization of Pyrrole with a range of different dopant anions in the presence of different RCNT dispersions. In these composites, the RCNT were completely covered by the polymer, consequently the electrochemical responses of these composites were dominated by the electrochemistry of the polymers with the CNT functioning as a conductor element. Polypyrrole was also electropolymerized using functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNT) as dopant. Electropolymerization was carried out using galvanostatic and potentiostatic techniques on gold-coated Mylar and ITO-glass. It was determined that PPy/FMWCNT composites deposited on either electrode using potentiostatic deposition exhibited redox peaks. This redox behavior was not observed when the galvanostatic deposition was employed. HCNT/Polyaniline (PAn) composites were prepared by either casting a film from a solution of HCNT and PAn in 1,2-Dichlorobenzene, or by casting a film of PAn onto an existing HCNT mat. The latter exhibited the highest conductivity. The actuation behavior of these CNT composites was investigated and it was determined that the PAn component contributes to the actuation strain while the HCNT component contributes to Young&#8217;s modulus. The combination of the HCNT (with their mechanical properties) and PAn (with its actuator behavior) offers and attractive route not only to reinforce the polymer film but also to introduce new electronic properties based on morphological modifications or electronic interactions between the two components giving a robust blend of optimum properties. These results open the door for these composites to be used in a variety of applications that require a combination of the above  characteristics such as mechanically reinforced actuator devices, robotics, optical fiber switches, prosthetic devices, and anti-vibration systems. In addition, PPy with a range of dopant anions was electrodeposited galvanostatically, potentiostatically, and potentiodynamically on the surface of four different carbon electrodes, RCNT mat (unannealed), RCNT mat (annealed), glassy carbon, and carbon foil. It was found that the method of electrodeposition was crucial to the electroactivity of the deposited polymers, particularly when deposited onto a RCNT mat due to the different interaction between the deposited polymer and the RCNT mat.  Finally, HCNT/SDS, HCNT/PMAS, and HCNT/DNA fibers were prepared using the Particle Coagulating Spinning method (PCS). The annealing process resulted in a dramatic increase in conductivity of up to 2600 times higher compared to the unannealed fibers. However, the annealing process did not play any role in keeping the fibers together or modifying the alignment of the carbon nanotubes ropes within the fibers. The HCNT/DNA fibers, with their biocompatibility, high conductivity, and good mechanical properties can be used as artificial muscles, bioelectronic sensors, or even as platforms to support the growth of nerve cells. This thesis delineates the methods of successful production of solid sate CNT mats and fibers, utilizing traditional polymeric and more novel multi- functional dispersant materials. Thereby, providing a series of new framework for which future device structures can be fabricated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/407</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of the engineering behaviour of railway ballast</field><field name="creator">Ionescu, Daniela</field><field name="description">The ballast layer is the most important component of the railway track infrastructure. It is subjected to both the traffic load and the exposure to environment changes. In consequence, the ballast bed deforms and degrades highly affecting the performance of the railway track. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate in detail the deformation behaviour and degradation characteristics of &#8216;fresh&#8217; ballast for typical loading and drainage conditions specific to railway tracks. Also, it is necessary to identify the factors that highly affect their variation. Better design of ballasted foundation provides higher track performance and ensures reduced maintenance costs. Also, the degradation caused by traffic loading (in field conditions) requires proper measure based on the Australian specifications in order to effectively plan the ballast-cleaning cycles so the maintenance costs are kept under control. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish the potential of using recycled aggregates (obtained from sieving the spoil from ballast maintenance processes) for the construction of railway tracks keeping in this way the maintenance cost to a minimum. In order to further bring light to the behaviour of railway ballast, &#8216;fresh&#8217; and recycled ballast specimens were subjected to monotonic and repeated loading in large-scale equipment (consolidation cell and cylindrical triaxial apparatus). Also, a unique prismoidal testing rig was designed and constructed to investigate the behaviour of railway ballast under dynamic true triaxial loading specific to in-service conditions. The fully instrumented equipment enables the measurement of: vertical pressures at different depth inside the ballast bed, lateral pressure developed within ballast layer, vertical and lateral plastic flow of ballast specimen upon loading. The results show that the ballast shear strength, degradation and plastic deformations (vertical and horizontal) are functions of the ballast type, confinement level, load magnitude, and are also related to the number of loading cycles. The most conspicuous observation is that independent of ballast type, gradation, maximum particle size and loading and drainage conditions, the grains crushing highly affect the strength and deformation characteristics of ballast. It was also observed that the degradation is always larger for coarser fractions of gradations modelled. The recycled ballast displayed higher deformation and degradation when compared with &#8216;fresh&#8217; ballast. A higher level of confinement of recycled ballast or restraint of lateral flow (geotextile inserts) may reduce the deformation and degradation of recycled ballast. Furthermore, a degradation index for the field conditions was proposed that properly quantifies the extent of ballast fouling and can be used to predict the ballast-cleaning cycles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/421</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An overview of Cochin Ceramics in Taiwan with an emphasis on the influence of Hong Kun-Fu and his school - 1910s to 1980s</field><field name="creator">Shih, Huei-Mei</field><field name="description">The Cochin ceramic is a fragile and delicate folk art, with a high aesthetic value. It was introduced to Taiwan from China two hundred years ago, and gradually developed and matured in Taiwan, resulting in a unique Taiwanese art form. Cochin ceramic was extensively used as architectural decorations for temples, family worship sites or luxurious houses in Taiwan before the 1950s. The ceramic figurines have the functions of decoration, and their auspicious symbols can fend off wicked forces and are emblems for a fortunate life. The legendary stories have scenes with Chinese moral and ethical adages which serve as cultural messages to the population. Cochin ceramic scenes and figures were closely bound with the people&#8217;s lives, and contained the essence of Taiwan folk art as a distinctive artistic history. After the 1950s Cochin ceramic was mainly used only in Taiwanese temples. Due to a lack of recognition of its important heritage significance, most of the early made Cochin ceramic in Taiwan is disappearing. My research emphasizes that it is important to preserve and keep a record of this valuable ceramic history. This thesis explores the decorative Cochin ceramics in Taiwanese temples from the 1910s-1990s, mainly focusing on the investigation of one of the most famous Chinese potters Hong Kunfu (ca.1885-1945) and five of his Taiwanese apprentices. The main purpose of my research is to document Hong&#8217;s origins, development of his school, their technique, and the stylistic characteristics of their works. This study demonstrates how their achievements have contributed to the development of Taiwanese Cochin ceramic. Through my fieldwork in Taiwan and China, I discovered more details of Hong&#8217;s School and the techniques and culture of Taiwanese Cochin ceramic. Based on the data collected, I have classified and compared the different features of Cochin ceramic work, and identified the difference styles among Hong School craftsmen. The thesis is organized as an exploration of the origin of Cochin ceramic, its evolution in Taiwan and a biographical sketch of Hong Kunfu and his successors, and their art works in Taiwan. This documenting of the existing Cochin figures helps the appreciation of a precious heritage in Taiwan.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/148</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fat flat feet: footwear for the obese child</field><field name="creator">Dowling, Annaliese</field><field name="description">Obesity is a global public health problem that affects both children and adults. The consequences and complications of bearing additional mass place an enormous amount of stress on the human body. Musculoskeletally, the feet must endure this excessive mass throughout the tasks of daily living as the feet are the terminus of the body for both stance and gait. Previous studies have reported that obese children display different foot structural characteristics and generate higher plantar pressures, particularly under the midfoot and forefoot, compared to non-obese children. It has been speculated that these higher plantar pressures may potentially place the feet of obese children at risk of injury, although this notion has not been confirmed. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to develop a shoe to cater for the unique structural and functional characteristics of the obese child and to examine whether the experimental shoe improved the level of shoe fit, comfort and decreased the high forefoot plantar pressures experienced by obese children when walking. To achieve this aim, the thesis was divided into two Experimental Sections, incorporating the development and assessment of the experimental footwear. In Experimental Section 1 foot shape, foot structure and function were evaluated in 437 children (aged 7-12 years) attending 27 primary schools in New South Wales to form a database of information regarding the feet of Australian children. Gender and age were found to affect the foot measurements obtained for these children, confirming that children&#8217;s feet develop at different rates and proportions. The boys displayed larger foot dimensions compared to the girls and, as anticipated, the older children displayed larger foot dimensions compared to the younger children. When these data were compared to adult foot dimension values they highlighted differences in proportion between adult and children&#8217;s feet, indicating the need to develop a children&#8217;s shoe last, as shoes manufactured as scaled-down versions of adult shoes will not correctly fit the foot shape of children&#8217;s feet. From this normative database the foot dimensions, plantar shape and plantar pressure variables for 45 obese children and 45 age and gender&#8211;matched controls were compared to establish the effect of obesity and gender on foot structure and function. The obese children displayed significantly greater values for 17 out of the 26 foot/leg dimensions, as well as an increased plantar contact area compared to their matched non obese counterparts. As no interaction was identified between gender and obesity, it was confirmed that the effects of obesity were not moderated by gender. In comparison to the non-obese children, the obese children generated higher forces, force-time integrals, peak pressures, pressure-time integrals and increased plantar contact area when walking compared to the non-obese children. Based on these results it was recommended that a shoe should be designed to cater for the larger foot dimensions characteristic of obese children and to cushion the larger plantar pressure distributions generated when these children walk. A survey was also undertaken to identify factors that influence the purchasing of children&#8217;s shoes. Parents indicated that fit and comfort were important factors influencing their footwear purchases for their child, even though few parents regularly had their child professionally fitted for shoes. It was anticipated that shoes would need to be replaced because the child had outgrown them, although there was also a high proportion of shoes being replaced because they had been worn out. An experimental shoe was designed to cater for obese children based on the foot structure, function and survey data. The two main design parameters included in the shoes were an increase in forefoot width to cater for the large foot dimensions of obese children and variations in midsole hardness to cushion the high plantar pressures. Six experimental shoes were evaluated by 14 children who were classified as either overweight and obese children or non-overweight children. Experimental Section 2 investigated how variations in shoe width and midsole hardness affected the fit, comfort, plantar pressures and gait in the two subject groups. A shoe fit assessment revealed no noticeable differences between the experimental shoes by the children. The shoe comfort and fit parameters, which were assessed via a visual analog scale, demonstrated that these parameters, when used in the evaluation of footwear, relied on individual perceptions of the wearer. The overweight/obese children did report slightly higher shoe fit and comfort values when wearing the wide shoe compared to the narrow shoe although this difference was not significant. However, the non-overweight children reported higher fit and comfort values than the overweight/obese children when wearing the wide shoes. In general, the plantar pressure distributions at the foot/shoe interface were lower than the previous barefoot values, indicating that footwear moderated the plantar pressure distributions generated during walking. Changes in shoe width and midsole density were found to to have negligible affect on the in-shoe plantar pressure variables and spatio-temporal gait parameters, which may be attributable to the small differences reported in shoe fit assessment. The soft shoes resulted in lower peak pressures being generated under the forefoot but higher peak pressures for the heel and midfoot. The overweight/obese children, regardless of footwear condition, altered their gait to cope with the stresses placed on their feet during walking. Clearly, further research is required to develop shoes to cater for the unique feet of obese children and to better dissipate loading during gait. It was concluded that a shoe based on the unique foot structure, shape and function of obese children is required by these children. However, the difficulty in designing such a shoe that is universally suitable for obese children because of differential foot development, are acknowledged. Further, perceptions of shoe fit and shoe comfort are highly subjective variables, compounding appropriate shoe design. This thesis highlighted that without good levels of shoe fit, it is difficult to achieve optimal shoe comfort. Although a shoe was developed based on the unique features of obese children&#8217;s feet, more modifications are required to the experimental shoes, especially in shoe width, in order to improve shoe fit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/382</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the level of consumer involvement in healthcare</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Karen</field><field name="description">Health and consumerism is a partnership featured in many Western developed countries. Nearly a decade ago, the National Quality Taskforce and Advisory Council recommended the adoption of a consumer oriented approach as being fundamental to providing safer services, minimising preventable adverse health outcomes, whist also improving healthcare quality. In accordance with this recommendation, it is now commonplace for healthcare organisations to incorporate the consumer oriented philosophy into their mission statements. In addition, healthcare recipients tend to be referred to as consumers in preference to the traditional term patient. Despite organisational commitment for change and reports of consumer satisfaction with acute care services in Australia (AIHW 2000), the findings from the Bristol Inquiry (2001) and the King Edward Memorial Hospital Inquiry (2001) suggests that there is an absence of consensus as to the impact of these initiatives on the delivery or quality of frontline healthcare. This study aims to determine indicators of consumer participation in the planning and delivery of healthcare in an Australian context. The practice of consumer participation at the individual level of frontline healthcare is examined specifically for indicators of active participation in both decision making and information sharing. This study is complimentary to Phase Two of a Commonwealth funded project designed to explore clinical teams and the organisation of care related to the clinical condition, elective caesarean section. The study&#8217;s participants have been determined by the Commonwealth project, with the study&#8217;s samples being drawn from the recipients and providers of elective caesarean section healthcare, in three Queensland public hospitals over a three month time frame.A multi-method approach is utilised to navigate the complex social and professional constructs that impact on the organisation and recording of elective caesarean section healthcare.  Triangulation of the environmental, clinician, consumer and medical record data from the three study sites allows for a greater understanding of the relationships between and within the data sets. The medical record audits tendency to lack evidence of consumers actively participating in information sharing and decision making is shown to be a reliable representation of the environments inability to support participation, and the clinician and consumer samples passive view of participation at the frontline of healthcare. The triangulated data also clearly demonstrates the diversity of views and behaviours that clinicians hold in relation to the involvement of consumers in healthcare and that in the main consumer involvement is not valued. In relation to the quality and safety of healthcare, aside from the clinician&#8217;s views on consumer participation, the absence of accountability to utilise standardised forms, function collaboratively or communicate clinical care effectively suggests that the study sites have numerous professional and governance issues that have yet to be effectively addressed.  In focusing on the individual aspects of the healthcare experience this study demonstrates that collection and aggregation of consumer satisfaction data to be an unreliable indictor of healthcare quality. This study demonstrates a potential relationship between expectations of healthcare and satisfaction with healthcare. Women who felt fully involved in decision making often claim to be dissatisfied with that level of involvement and women who felt uninvolved are often satisfied with not being involved. In order to satisfy consumers and secure a positive health outcome measure, the study findings suggest matching expectations with experience, and this would involve an active level of participation. However, meeting the consumer&#8217;s expectations and generating satisfaction should not be interpreted as representative of meeting the technical quality or service delivery standards.This study contributes to the limited body of research relating to consumer participation at the individual level of healthcare. The study demonstrates that overall the level of consumer involvement in healthcare is marginal. Inconsistency in beliefs and behaviours and an ad hoc approach to organising and communicating clinical care ensures the passivity of the healthcare recipients and brings into question the true quality and safety of Australian healthcare.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/35</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and function studies of recombinant clusterin</field><field name="creator">Gonzalez Cendales, Yvonne T</field><field name="description">Clusterin is a ubiquitous secreted glycoprotein that acts as an extracellular chaperone. It effectively inhibits stress-induced protein aggregation by an ATP independent mechanism, binding to partially unfolded proteins and forming soluble high molecular weight complexes with them (Wilson and Easterbrook-Smith, 2000).  A model proposed by Yerbury et al. (2005) suggested that if clusterin mediates the clearance and degradation of misfolded extracellular proteins in vivo and this action is anti-inflammatory, a recombinant form of clusterin might be therapeutically useful to clear protein debris from sites of disease and inflammation and in this way suppress pathology. The expression of recombinant mammalian proteins is often performed using mammalian or insect cells because some post-translational processes (glycosylation, phosphorylation, oligomerization, specific protein cleavage and disulfide bond formation) are not performed by bacterial cells (Sambrook et al., 1989). However, since Stewart et al. (2007) showed that clusterin retains its chaperone function when deglycosylated and that deglycosylation did not induce major structural changes in the molecule, the possibility of producing chaperone-active human clusterin in bacteria became apparent. This thesis describes an attempt to produce a chaperone-active recombinant clusterin expressed in bacteria to provide a large scale supply of protein useful in therapeutic applications. In addition, two different commercially available recombinant clusterin proteins were compared in structure and chaperone function with human serum clusterin to provide additional insights into any functional limitations of recombinantly expressed clusterin proteins and to supply the information to the manufacturer. Firstly, the expression of clusterin - MBP fusion protein was attempted in E. coli TBI but full length recombinant clusterin - MBP fusion protein was only detected as a minor species; a large part of the product  was cleaved from MBP during expression and most of the MBP-clusterin fusion protein was degraded with time. Thus, because it was not possible to obtain a source of stable clusterin - MBP fusion protein, the expression of clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein was attempted. Gateway&#174; cloning technology was used for cloning and expressing clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein in E. coli. After expression, the protein was extracted and purified under denaturing conditions. The purified protein was subsequently refolded in 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1% azide, alkylated with 50 mM IAA and dialyzed prior to developing functional and structural analyses. After expression in E. coli TBI, clusterin &#8211; 6xHis Tag fusion protein was detected along with disulfide-bonded high molecular weight aggregates and putative truncated products. While structural studies by CD revealed that the predicted secondary structure content of clusterin &#8211; 6xHis tag fusion protein and plasma-derived clusterin were similar, functional analysis revealed that the former had little if any chaperone activity (its limited effects on the heat-induced precipitation of fibrinogen were not dose-dependent). Structural (SEC, CD) and functional analyses (chaperone assays and IgG binding test) of Flag-Tagged full-length recombinant human clusterin (expressed in human embryonic kidney cells) and His-Tagged partial-length recombinant rat clusterin (expressed in E. coli, not post translationally processed, thus not cleaved into &#61537; and &#946; chains and not glycosilated) (both commercial proteins from BioVendor- Laboratory Medicine, Inc.) indicated that the recombinant proteins tested had (i) an increased proportion of high molecular weight species when compared with plasma-derived clusterin, (ii) predicted secondary structure content similar to that of plasma-derived clusterin, (iii) chaperone activity but were less effective than plasma-derived clusterin (recombinant human 28%, recombinant rat 48% less effective) and (iv) were able to bind IgG, the IgG binding activity was dose-dependent and similar to that of plasma-derived clusterin. Furthermore, the results obtained for recombinant rat clusterin suggested that the expression of chaperone active clusterin in bacteria is possible and that cleavage into &#61537; and &#946; chains and the C-terminus of the beta chain (residues 22-145) are not required for chaperone or IgG binding activity. Further studies will be required to optimize production of a chaperone active form of human clusterin in bacteria.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/68</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changes in adipose tissue in response to exercise and diet</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Michael</field><field name="description">Why study adipose tissue? What significance does it have within the body? Early anatomists believed adipose tissue to be a relatively inert tissue with a sole purpose to support organs in the body. Growth of adipose tissue is the cause behind obesity. If you examine the statistics related to adipose tissue you would soon see why research is needed in this field. The World Health Organisation has recently estimated that there are 250 million obese and 400 to 500 million overweight worldwide. The International Obesity Task Force has shown that obesity is increasing in all societies, not just in western civilisations. We are soon looking at the prospect of over half of the humans on earth being overweight or obese. The worldwide cost of weight loss programs mounts up to billions of dollars per year. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Type II diabetes along with many other diseases are strongly associated with obesity. Adipose tissue is poorly understood as an organ. The area of adipose tissue vascular research is only in its infancy with one of the first major studies conducted only 55 years ago. All aspects of morphology of adipose tissue and its vasculature are insufficiently described, especially in regards to weight loss. In comparison to the wealth of information known about weight gain, there is very little understanding of weight loss in particular in regards to adipose tissue microvasculature changes. The current treatments for obesity are; drug therapies, diet, exercise and surgical intervention. All of these treatments, however, are temporary and do not solve the underlying problem. Hence there is a need for research into the mechanisms of weight loss and the microvasculature of adipose tissue. For, it is the microvasculature that is responsible for the delivery/removal of substrates to and from adipocytes causing them to grow and shrink in size. Despite the numerous studies and increased awareness into the many causes and effects that adipose tissue growth has there are still areas of uncertainty. The cellular changes that occur in adipose tissue as people become obese are still in much debate. Moreover, the reason as to why there are such varied responses between individuals who eat the same foods in still relatively unexplained. There were three main objectives in this study. Firstly, to describe the microvascular similarities and differences between various rat adipose depots. Secondly, to compare the changes in the microvasculature of adipose tissue in sedentary rats with rats that had lost progressive amounts of weight through exercising. Thirdly, to compare the cellular (number and size) changes in adipocytes from two cohorts of mice that consumed a high fat diet with mice on a low fat (control) diet. Rats were perfused with Microfil and four different fat tissue sites were sampled (mesenteric, parametrial, retroperitoneal and subcutaneous depots). The adipose tissue was prepared using the &#8216;whole mount&#8217; method and stained with a modified Haematoxylin and Eosin protocol. Using light and stereomicroscopy the samples were studied from the level of the arteries that entered the fat pads right down to the microvascular bed. Anatomical descriptions were made of various prominent features displayed by the vasculature and compared and contrasted between the pads that were sampled. The rats were found to display diverse qualities in terms of their adipose tissue and vascular arrangement. All the microvascular beds (capillaries and next order arterioles) were all similar in all the depots displaying either &#8216;Y&#8217; or &#8216;hairpin&#8217; branching characteristics. The connective tissue arrangement was distinct in each of the fat pads. There was also the presence of mast cells and inflammatory cells in amongst the adipocytes and capillary beds. A model was designed whereby rats were placed in running wheel cages for various time periods. These rats were compared with sedentary controls that resided in normal cages but ate the same diet as the exercised rats. Tissue was sampled from all the groups and adipocyte diameter, volume and mean capillary diffusion distance were measured. There were differences between rats that ran and the sedentary rat in terms of microvascular bed spatial arrangement. Capillaries of run rats were closer together as opposed to sedentary rats, which were further apart. A scheme was proposed for the remodelling of the microvasculature of the fat pad in response to weight loss. There appeared to be a relationship between the amount of time spent running and adipocyte cell size effect but this needs further study to be elucidated. An experiment was set up to investigate a different model of diet-induced obesity in healthy wild-type mice. Moreover the main interest was in studying how their adipocytes responded to dietary influences. This study was designed to examine two cohorts of mice that consumed a high fat diet and compared them to low fat fed control mice. The first group of mice were selected as the quintile at the top of the distribution curve for body weight and the second at the bottom of the distribution curve for body weight. There were significant cellular differences in the number and size of the adipocytes when comparing the two cohorts of high fat fed mice with the low fat fed control mice. Several possible mechanisms were proposed to explain the cellular differences observed between the two responses shown by the two cohorts of mice fed a high fat diet. All these sets of experiments provided only a taste of the information that potentially could come with further research into adipose tissue loss and gain. The investigation of adipose tissue has been, and still is, relatively neglected compared with other areas of medical research. Adipose tissue gain (or Obesity) should be known as the silent killer for it is the big underlying factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type II diabetes. There is still a lot of information to be gathered about adipose tissue before any advances can be made towards effective therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/416</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To develop and trial a new warfarin education program</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Judy</field><field name="description">The principal purpose of this study was to identify, develop and trial a new warfarin education program to enhance warfarin knowledge, management and compliance in a wider patient population, inclusive of the &#8216;high risk&#8217; group. This &#8216;high risk&#8217; group included patients who were elderly, had low literacy skills and came from non-English speaking backgrounds.Effective patient education is a central part of the practice of all health professionals because it helps to ensure safe and effective warfarin management. With recent increases in warfarin prescribing and warfarin-related adverse drug events the need for an effective patient warfarin education program is more apparent.The study aims to improve currently available warfarin education programs delivered to warfarin prescribed patients in a home-based setting. The new program is conceptually based on five key elements: improved health professional/patient communication and partnerships; improved warfarin compliance; simple, easy-to-read warfarin information, improved continuity of care between hospital and community settings; and improved patient follow-up. Unfortunately, during the course of the study, many similar strategies and interventions targeting these key elements were incorporated into the customary program, as well as the new program, which may have impacted on the final results of the study.The study was conducted from February 2003 to February 2004, on consenting patients who were prescribed warfarin and admitted to Illawarra Health&#8217;s The Ambulatory Care Team (TACT). This prospective study included 50 intervention patients receiving the new warfarin education program, and 52 control patients receiving the customary warfarin education program offered to TACT patients. Many of these patient participants also came from the &#8216;high risk&#8217; group, which included; the elderly, those with low literacy skills and those from non-English speaking backgrounds.The evaluation phase of the study involved comparing and contrasting the effectiveness of the new warfarin education program against the customary warfarin education program, in terms of the patients&#8217; warfarin knowledge, management and compliance. The patients&#8217; satisfaction with the information received and their therapeutic outcomes (therapeutic INR scores, healthcare visits and warfarin-related adverse drug events) were also compared and contrasted between the two programs.The findings of this study suggest that the new warfarin information booklet (APPENDIX 12) was written in a better quality, easier-to-read format, than was the Boots warfarin information booklet (2003). Overall, the trend in the results suggested that the new warfarin education program more effectively educated patients, including the &#8216;high risk&#8217; patients, about their warfarin therapy, as compared to the customary warfarin education program. The patients receiving the new warfarin education program were more knowledgeable about their warfarin, more confidently managed and complied with their warfarin therapy at home, and achieved better therapeutic outcomes, than did patients who received the customary warfarin education program. Interestingly, both the new and the customary warfarin education programs used in this study appeared to be more effective than other available warfarin education programs, achieving better warfarin knowledge scores and therapeutic outcomes, with fewer warfarin-related adverse drug events and healthcare visits.The implications of this study are that by targeting the five key elements of an effective warfarin education program we can help to improve warfarin knowledge, management and compliance in many patients, including those from the &#8216;high risk&#8217; group. Education based on the five key elements empowers patients to make educated decisions about their warfarin therapy; which in turn help to optimise their warfarin-related therapeutic outcomes and minimise warfarin-related adverse drug events.One of the major benefits of this research, is that the five key elements of an effective patient education program, used in this new warfarin education program, can be generically applied to other patient medication education programs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/561</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on nonlinear behaviour of subgrades under cyclic loading for the development of a design chart for flexible pavements</field><field name="creator">Bodhinayake, Beatrice Chandrani</field><field name="description">The road pavement is continuously subjected to the loads transferred from moving vehicles during its design life and stresses and strains (responses) are induced in all pavement layers. The responses occur in the subgrade, which is the in-situ soil stratum with a low modulus, would gradually accumulate with the increase in volume of traffic although those responses are low in their magnitudes. It is reasonable to assume that the responses which occur in other pavement layers constructed according to the specifications outlined by the road authorities are recoverable due to their high moduli. Therefore, the performance of a road pavement significantly depends on the behaviour of its subgrade under the action of moving traffic. Moreover, a study on this behaviour of nonlinear subgrade would increase the confidence of pavement engineers in the design of flexible pavements. The in-depth literature review has revealed that the nonlinear behaviour of subgrades under the action of moving traffic has not been incorporated into the design charts that are currently being used. Furthermore, the multi-layer elastic theory has been used for developing those design charts, although, the sophisticated and fairly expensive finite element computer codes are able to produce accurate results. Therefore, the intention of this study is to investigate the nonlinear behaviour of subgrades under cyclic loading and to develop a design chart for flexible pavements incorporating that behaviour of subgrades employing the finite element theory in all the analyses. The granular pavements are the most widely used type of flexible pavements in Australia. Since subgrade materials with CBR values 5 and 7 are commonly found in road corridors of Australia, two granular base pavements tested under the cyclic loading by means of Accelerated Loading Facility (ALF) were selected from Callington, South Australia (with a subgrade of CBR of 5) and Beerburrum, Queensland (with a subgrade of CBR of 7). An appropriate pavement block is selected from the tested area and modelled as a finite element model for each pavement. The applied cyclic ALF load was modelled as a stress pulse with a cycle time and amplitude. The pavement materials, except subgrades, in both pavements were modelled as linear elastic materials with their moduli and Poisson&#8217;s ratios. Two curves of stress versus strain were developed using available literature and used to model the nonlinear subgrades in both pavements. Since an analysis with millions of cycles of load applications would require enormous amount of computer time, the analysis was carried out in stages. When an analysis is carried out in stages, the stresses and strains in nonlinear materials are to be submitted at the beginning of each stage as initial conditions. Two curves of permanent strain versus number of load applications were developed using available literature for both subgrade materials. With the aid of those curves together with the developed stress versus strain curves, the stresses and strains in nonlinear subgrade materials at the beginning of each stage were determined. The modelled pavement with the modelled linear and nonlinear materials together with initial conditions was analysed when subjected to the modelled cyclic load in each stage. The maximum deformations computed on the surface of the pavement were compared with their corresponding field measured permanent deformations. The agreement between the computed deformations and the field measured deformations during the ALF testing has revealed that the curves of stress versus strain as well as the curves of permanent strain versus number of load applications developed for two subgrade materials for studying their nonlinear behaviour under cyclic loading produce satisfactory results. Therefore, those curves were employed in estimating the deformations of granular base pavements with subgrade materials with CBR values of 5 and 7. Two sets of granular base pavements consist of identical thin asphalt surfaces and granular bases were considered for the analysis. The CBR values of subgrade materials in these two sets were considered as 5 and 7 respectively. The base thickness of these pavements was changed from 350mm to 750mm with 100mm increments for both sets. The analysis was carried out in stages for each pavement using the general purpose finite element computer code ABAQUS/Standard. The maximum deformation computed at a point on the surface at the end of each stage was plotted against the corresponding number of load applications for each pavement. Those curves were used to estimate the number of load applications that would produce a deformation of 25mm on each pavement. The estimated number of load applications was assumed as the allowable number of Equivalent Standard Axles (ESA&#8217;s) applied on each pavement during its design life. The base thickness was plotted against the allowable number of ESA&#8217;s for each pavement and presented as the design curves for CBR 5 and CBR 7 in the design chart developed in this study. In conclusion, the agreement between the computed deformations and the field measured deformations during the ALF testing has demonstrated that the curves developed for studying the nonlinear behaviour of subgrade materials under cyclic loading were able to estimate the deformations in real pavement structures quite accurately.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/868</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The game of expertise: investigating the use of science in a professional disciplinary setting</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Margaret Christina</field><field name="description">The thesis aims to examine and understand what takes place when a statutory authority, responsible for regulating the practice of a particular set of clinicians (nurses and midwives), claims to use the principles of evidence-based practice to scrutinise the practice of an authorised clinician. It reports on the results of a thematic analysis of the reasons for decision, findings, and transcripts of the New South Wales Nurses&#8217; Tribunal hearings into allegations of professional misconduct made against homebirth midwife Maggie Lecky Thompson in the period 1996 to 1998.This thesis is about the connection between the scientific basis for health care and the way that this type of knowledge is used to make judgements about the acceptability or otherwise of the care provided by a health care professional. The research takes as a starting point the development of evidence-based practice in health care and the use of empirically supported guidelines to direct care decisions. It acknowledges the socially constructed and contingent nature of such knowledge.Themes were derived from the conceptual framework of the &#8216;Game board of expertise&#8217; developed by Sheila Jasanoff, a sociology of scientific knowledge scholar. These themes provide organisers that enable analysis and understanding of the tactics deployed by both, the complainant, the New South Wales Health Care Complaints Commission, and the respondent, Maggie Lecky Thompson in their presentation, construction and deconstruction of scientific evidence as mediated by each party&#8217;s expert witnesses. When viewed from the perspective of the findings and &#8216;reasons for decision&#8217; of each of the two relevant NSW Nurses&#8217; Tribunal hearings, this thematic analysis provides insights to the rationale for the deployment of particular strategic manoeuvres by the protagonists in this legal action.The analysis reveals that the themes of neutrality, credibility, objectivity, framing choices, standards of admissibility, and form and function were extant in the transcripts, findings, or reasons for findings of the NSW Nurses&#8217; Tribunal hearings into allegations of professional misconduct made against midwife Maggie Lecky Thompson. There was no evidence of one remaining theme, judicial predilection, in the public documents available in relation to these hearings.Jasanoff&#8217;s &#8216;Game board of expertise&#8217; is a tool that assists in the analysis of the processes of &#8216;constructing&#8217; scientific facts and moulding them to the particular purposes of each of the protagonists to a legal dispute. This type of analysis is a potentially useful tool for understanding the process by which one voice, usually the scientific voice, is privileged over others and also how opposing points of view are subjugated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/854</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and characterisation of nano carbon doped MgB2 form of wire and bulk</field><field name="creator">Yeoh, Wai Kong</field><field name="description">The objective of this work is to further enhance the critical current density of the MgB2 superconductor by doping with the two carbon sources: multiwalled carbon nanotube (CNT) and nano carbon. The work in this thesis concentrates on the fabrication and characterization on the CNT and nano C doped MgB2 with main objective being the enhancement of the critical current density in the high magnetic field. Consequently, introducing effective pinning centres in the form of dopants to enhance the flux pinning will be the main task of this project.In this project, the effect of carbon doping MgB2 with carbon nanotubes and nano C on transition temperature, lattice parameters, critical current density and flux pinning for MgB2-xCx with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 under the various condition was studied. Both types of doping showed excellent Jc compared to the pure MgB2, with significant enhancement observed at higher temperature. Magnetic Jc(H) was enhanced by a factor of 72 at 5K for a field 8T and a factor of 33 at 20K for a field of 5T for nano C bulk samples, respectively. On the other hand, Jc(H) of CNT samples was enhanced by a factor of 26 and 13 under the equivalent conditions. In high field, transport Jc of magnitude 2122 A/cm2 and 3821 A/cm2 was observed at 4.2K and 12T for CNT and nano C doped MgB2. These results indicate that flux pinning was enhanced by the boron substitution for carbon with increasing processing temperature. However, it was found that the lattice distortion and optimum doping level is different in the CNT and nano C samples which is due to the reactivity of the carbon source, resulting in different carbon substitution rate. Due to better reactivity and homogenous mixing of nano C,  nano C doped MgB2 resulted in better improvement in magnetic and transport Jc(H), as compared to CNT doped MgB2. This is mainly because CNT fibres with high aspect ratio tend to entangle, which suppressed the reactivity.The depression of Tc, which is caused by the boron substitution for carbon, increases with increasing the doping level, processing temperature and duration for both types of carbon doping. By controlling the extent of the substitution and inclusion of carbon, we can achieve the optimal improvement of critical current density and flux pinning in magnetic fields while maintaining the minimum reduction in Tc. In addition, the values of Hc2 and Hirr are higher for CNT doped samples than for the pure MgB2 at the same value of T/Tc. The morphology of the CNT doped MgB2 is similar to that of nano C doped MgB2, but different from the pure MgB2. The microstructure exhibits noticeable nanoparticles with size around 10-20nm, which are believed to be MgO and MgB2.Magnetization measurements indicate a change in the critical current density with the length of nanotube and not with its outside diameter. This is due to longer nanotubes tending to entangle with each other, preventing their homogenous mixing with MgB2 and dispersion. Low intensity ultrasonication, as a method of dispersion of CNT&#8217;s into precursor magnesium and boron powder, was introduced to improve homogeneity of mixing of CNT&#8217;s with the MgB2 matrix. Ultrasonication of CNT doped MgB2 resulted in a significant enhancement in the field dependence of critical current density, while avoiding the side-effects that would occur at higher processing temperatures.Carbon nanotubes (CNT&#8217;s) have unusual electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. The elongated CNT&#8217;s induce anisotropy in Jc in relation to the direction of applied field in MgB2/Fe wires and the value of Jc for the carbon nanotube-doped wires is insensitive to heating rates. We believe that by taking the extraordinary electrical, mechanical and thermal properties of CNT&#8217;s, the mechanical properties and thermal stability of CNT doped wire will be substantially improved. Studies on these properties are underway.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/545</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine environment protection and biodiversity conservation: the application and future development of the IMO's particularly sensitive sea area concept</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Julian Peter</field><field name="description">In the context of marine environment protection and biodiversity conservation, a number of measures adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) can be viewed as implementing obligations and recommendations of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 and the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity respectively. Pre-eminent among these measures is the particularly sensitive sea area (PSSA) concept; a tool that can be applied in an integrated manner, irrespective of maritime jurisdictional boundaries. However, despite the potential benefits that PSSA designation can deliver, recent practice both within the IMO and by individual member States, has considerably undermined confidence in this emerging concept, calling into question its whole basis as an effective management tool. Recent nominations by individual member States, for PSSA designation, have had the effect of dividing the IMO community over the scope and application of the PSSA concept, resulting in demands by several States to re-examine and constrain the concept. Some observers consider that the manner by which the IMO considers and decides upon applications for PSSA designation has aggravated this situation and have called for a review of the IMO approval process in its entirety. That this should occur at a time when many observers and coastal State members are increasingly realising the potential benefits of the PSSA concept is all the more cause for concern.The focus of this thesis is on the events within the IMO that have led to this lack of confidence arising. The central theme of the investigation is that the current situation can largely be attributed to the actions of certain member States, in their interpretation and implementation of the PSSA concept, and to the current mechanisms adopted by the IMO for reviewing and approving individual submissions for PSSA designation. A number of specific issues can also be identified with the PSSA Guidelines themselves. This thesis presents an examination of coastal State practice with the PSSA concept, and seeks to address how confidence in the measure can be restored, while satisfying both coastal and maritime States&#8217; interests. In undertaking this analysis, the research provides evidence of the value of the PSSA concept, but also demonstrates its limitations. In this regard, the thesis presents a &#8216;reality check&#8217; which seeks to rationalise some of the heightened expectations with the concept that are apparent in the current debate. The research argues that States may seek to designate PSSAs more for their &#8216;iconic status&#8217; than for any demonstrable environmental benefits that may be realised. Such an approach will contribute to the current lack of confidence in the measure and could conceivably result in a complete and irrevocable loss of confidence in the measure by the shipping community.On the basis of the empirical analysis presented and the comparison with alternative protection strategies, this thesis draws conclusions over the value of the PSSA concept and makes recommendations for the future development of the concept. A number of specific amendments are suggested for the PSSA Guidelines themselves, as well as changes to the institutional arrangements for reviewing and approving PSSA nominations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/547</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multi-image query content-based image retrieval</field><field name="creator">Ren, Feng H</field><field name="description">Content-based retrieval is based on the premise that the similarity measures in the feature space accord well with visual perceptual similarity. Furthermore, the queryby-example paradigm assumes that the query concept is well specified by the user via the example image supplied. The inadequacy of these assumptions has led to the development of several similarity measures and visual features that capture and describe colour, texture and edge information in images. The simultaneous use of multiple features, relevance feedback and more recently and the use of multiple example images in specifying the query are attempts to improve the accuracy at which the query concept can be captured. Results obtained so far are still far from the ideal because of inadequate knowledge of the human perceptual processes and this leads to the so called &#8221;Semantic Gap&#8221;. This thesis proposes a multi-image query-by-example content-based image retrieval scheme in which the significance of the components of feature vectors (intra-level) and the significance of the selected features (inter-level) are estimated through weight computation. These weights are used in calculating the feature distances and visual similarity between the query images and the database images. The hypothesis is that by incorporating the significance of features at both levels, the weighted visual similarity measure will yield improved retrieval performance (precision and recall rates). The model of the weight estimation and assignment is developed and experiments are conducted to validate the hypothesis. On average the proposed method improved the precision and recall rates in retrieval tasks on a database of natural images.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/571</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The end(s) of cinema: cinema in the age of digital transformation</field><field name="creator">Martin, Graham</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the affects of digital technology on cinema. The particular question it addresses is whether there is a discrete object called digital cinema with a clearly defined set of formal practices and conventions. In answering this question a &#8216;television model&#8217; was employed that determined the formation of a digital cinema to be the product of the interactions between cinema, television and digital technologies. In this sense digital cinema was not just a continuation of cinema by digital means. Most previous ways of examining digital cinema placed it in the same theoretical framework of modernity and modernism that had been used to explain cinema&#8217;s emergence in the late 19th century. These explanations mainly concentrated on the issue of producing permanently fixed images that the apparatus of cinema then brought to life in front of a paying audience. Digital cinema on the other hand responded to a different set of concerns. The idea of digital cinema was born out of the desire to distribute cinema images electronically in a similar way to cable television. Digital cinema therefore followed a more postmodern trajectory concerned with media distribution and exhibition as a form of spectacle or event. This is best explained through the discourses of televisuality, telepresencing, simultaneity and the kind of manipulability enabled by computing technologies that have taken over to become the mechanisms of technical and aesthetic change. The conclusion reached by this thesis is that while cinema is undergoing massive changes these changes are evolutionary not revolutionary. Rather than constituting a paradigm shift in the Khunian sense into the new media it represents an extension and renegotiation of its technical and theoretical limits to both encompass and be encompassed by the new media. Cinema while being increasingly marginalised through these changes will remain a worthwhile object of study because its  discourses and theoretical structures still have the power to comment meaningfully if not completely on the phenomena of new media like digital cinema.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/48</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"What men ought to be": masculinities in Jane Austen's novels</field><field name="creator">Ailwood, Sarah</field><field name="description">&#8220; &#8216;What men ought to be&#8217;: Masculinities in Jane Austen&#8217;s Novels&#8221; examines Jane Austen&#8217;s literary constructions of men and masculinity as feminine and feminist contributions to the public debate on ideal English masculinity throughout the Romantic period.  It explores the problematic position of women writers in critiquing masculinity in the highly politicised context of the Romantic period and develops a theoretical approach to interpreting their constructions of desirable and undesirable masculinities as being representative of their social, cultural and feminist concerns.  Throughout her novels, Jane Austen&#8217;s representations of the desirable male &#8211; of &#8216;what men ought to be&#8217; &#8211; are informed by her fundamental concerns regarding the realisation of female selfhood and the fulfilment of women&#8217;s desires, and the political survival and moral wellbeing of the English nation.  This thesis argues that Austen&#8217;s novels seek to reform socially-approved codes of gentry masculinity by endorsing a model of male identity that is not dependent on the submission or passivity of women in courtship or domestic relationships, promoted by conventional patriarchal ideologies.  Austen&#8217;s novel&#8217;s dramatise the process by which men can choose to forge a masculine identity that allows women a greater socially and publicly participatory role, both enabling the fulfilment of female desire and ensuring the security and wellbeing of the English nation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/124</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">China's response to international fisheries law and policy: national action and regional cooperation</field><field name="creator">Xue, Guifang</field><field name="description">The global fisheries crisis has been of great concern to the international community, and has led to the adoption of a series of instruments under the fisheries framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC). These post-LOSC fisheries instruments include the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement); the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (Fish Stocks Agreement); the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (Code of Conduct); and the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing (IPOAIUU). The aforementioned instruments have improved the LOSC fisheries framework and had considerable impact on the way fisheries resources are utilised and managed. However, they have not stopped the continual depletion of fisheries resources as they rely largely on the implementation by individual states to achieve their management objectives. The ineffectiveness of these instruments is mainly due to the fact that they have not been widely implemented by, or incorporated into, the fisheries law and policy of states. As one of the major fishing nations with the largest population in the world, China has faced many problems managing its fisheries: the severest of which are the depletion of fisheries resources and the deterioration of the marine environment. This situation has necessitated China&#8217;s alignment with international fisheries law and policy. The study analyses China&#8217;s legislative harmonisation and policy adjustment in response to these international fisheries instruments, in particular resource management, distant water fisheries, and regional fisheries cooperation for the shared fisheries resources in the form of bilateral fisheries agreements with Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. The study pinpoints the fact that China&#8217;s fisheries development, particularly the problems it has encountered, including its excessive fishing capacity, economic incentives, population pressures, and a weak institutional framework, reflect the global situation and provides a basis for understanding the driving forces behind a gradual loss of control of fishing capacity leading to the depletion of resources. China&#8217;s national action and regional cooperation mirrors the overall effort of the international community in searching for possible solutions to address the fisheries crisis. The study emphasises that the LOSC will remain as a dynamic instrument and a point of reference for the legal norms at the global, regional and national levels to deal with the countless issues of fisheries management. The post-LOSC instruments will stand as guidelines for states to conserve and manage fisheries resources on the way to achieving sustainable fisheries. States like China will have to fully commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities to achieve sustainable fisheries management.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/369</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of weed invasion and control on plant-bird interactions and bird communities</field><field name="creator">Gosper, Carl R</field><field name="description">Introduced plants can have a variety of impacts in ecosystems in which they become invasive. These impacts can include the disruption of interactions between native plant and animal species, such as seed dispersal and pollination. Subsequently, other interactions and mutualisms can be affected, both at the site of the plant invasion and elsewhere. Interactions can also become established between the invasive plant and native and invasive animal species. The removal of an invasive plant has the potential to disrupt these newly formed interactions, thus disadvantaging some fauna and potentially affecting subsequent interactions involving these species. While control of invasive plants is typically a goal of conservation management, the consequences of control for other species are rarely fully considered or investigated. In this study, I have tested several hypotheses regarding the interaction of an invasive plant with fauna, and the effects of the plant&#8217;s invasion and control on plant-animal interactions.Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata) is an invasive plant in coastal New South Wales (NSW), Australia. South African in origin, it has now spread to occupy at least 80% of the NSW coastline. Fruit production in C. monilifera is prolific and fruits are consumed and dispersed by vertebrates, especially birds. In addition to other effects of C. monilifera, this plant-animal interaction has the potential to affect the seed dispersal of other  vertebratedispersed plants and also the composition of the bird community, which may subsequently affect other plant-bird interactions. In order to quantify the magnitude of these possible effects, I designed this study with the following five major components: (i) comparison of the fruiting characteristics of C. monilifera with those of co-occurring birddispersed native plant species; (ii) description of the plant-bird interactions that involve flowers and fruits in vegetation that has been invaded or is at risk of invasion by C. monilifera; (iii) measurement of the rate of removal of C. monilifera fruits and those of some co-occurring bird-dispersed plant species in: habitat dominated by C. monilifera, where C. monilifera had been eliminated by the application of herbicide, and uninvaded vegetation; (iv) assessment of the effect of C. monilifera removal by herbicide application on the species composition and abundance of the bird community; and (v) assessment of the effect of dominance of the vegetation community by C. monilifera on the species composition and abundance of the bird community. I found that the fruits of C. monilifera are within the range of physical dimensions and nutrient composition of those of co-occurring native species. The greatest distinction in fruit  characteristics is in phenology and the combination of phenology and morphology, as peak production of C. monilifera fruits occurs when native fruits are scarce. Consequently, C. monilifera fruits are attractive to vertebrate dispersers, especially birds. At least 25 species of birds feed on C. monilifera fruits in NSW, most of which are indigenous and are likely to disperse viable seeds.In an experimental study using feeding stations, I found that the rate of removal of fruits of native plant species was unaffected by either dense infestation of C. monilifera, or its elimination. This is likely to be due to highly facultative relationships between frugivorous birds and plants, combined with differences in phenology and, in some cases, the morphology of fruits of native plants and C. monilifera. Consequently, in this system there has been little impact of an invasive plant on this plant-bird interaction. The rate of removal of C. monilifera fruits, however, was less in herbicide-treated habitat. This has implications for long-term C. monilifera control, because herbicide treatment often leaves scattered individual plants alive, which would have poorer seed dispersal than plants in dense C. monilifera stands.The removal of C. monilifera affected the bird community, with the overall abundance of birds declining in herbicide-treated areas after the C. monilifera died. Only those birds that consume C. monilifera fruits were affected, while other groups of birds that do not directly use C. monilifera resources were unaffected. Although this impact was minor, it illustrates that removal of an invasive plant can affect bird communities, and these impacts should be considered before control programs are implemented. Dominance of the vegetation by C. monilifera also affected bird communities, with overall bird abundance, specifically that of insectivorous birds, and at some locations nectarivorous birds, being lower in C. monilifera than native habitat. The quantity of remaining native vegetation, particularly of nectar-producing plants widely used by birds, appears to be important in determining bird community composition in invaded areas.In this study, I have demonstrated that both dominance of the vegetation by an invasive plant, and the control of an invasive plant, can induce change in fauna communities, and disrupt some plant-animal interactions. These changes will need to be considered carefully in planning management actions to conserve coastal bird communities and their interactions with plants. While continued efforts to control C. monilifera are clearly justified, these should form part of a broad strategy for coastal community conservation, including consideration of other threats to native communities that act independently or in concert with C. monilifera invasion. These considerations should include the potential impacts of other invasive plant species, targeted sites and species for control efforts, and other forms of habitat loss and degradation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/371</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of chiral conducting polymers for asymmetric electrosynthesis</field><field name="creator">Pornputtkul, Yingpit</field><field name="description">This thesis describes novel synthetic routes and characterization of chiral conducting polymers based on aniline and substituted anilines that have potential applications in the areas of asymmetric electrosynthesis and chiral separations. Ionic liquids and novel chiral ionic liquids are used as novel electrolytes for the polymer synthesis and for improvement of the electrochemical stability of chiral polyaniline doped with (+)-10- camphorsulfonic acid. Electroorganic syntheses using bare or chiral polyaniline modified electrodes in ionic liquids or chiral ionic liquid electrolytes are explored. Following an Introduction and a General Experimental Chapter, the new studies are described in Chapters 3 to 10.Chapter 3 reports a novel route to prepare optically active emeraldine salts via thermal treatment. Emeraldine base films were prepared by alkaline de-doping of PAn.HCl emeraldine salt films electrochemically deposited or chemically prepared. Chemically prepared emeraldine base films were cast onto glass slides from NMP solution. Redoping these films with aqueous (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (1.0 M (+)-HCSA) gave optically inactive PAn.(+)-HCSA films. Significantly, after heat treatment at 170&#176;C, optically active polyaniline were generated, as evidenced by their circular dichroism spectra. This is believed to be due to the polyaniline chains preferentially adopting a one-handed helix under the influence of the chiral dopant CSA- anion during heating of the films at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polyaniline.An unprecedented route to optically active polyanilines from achiral reagents using a chiral emeraldine salt inducer is described in Chapter 4. This acromolecular asymmetric proliferation is performed via electrochemical polymerization of aniline in racemic (e.g. (&#177;)-HCSA) or achiral (e.g. HCl and p-TSA) acid solutions using a thin film of chiral PAn.(+)-HCSA or PAn.(-)-HCSA pre-electrodeposited on the working electrode as a chiral inducer. The thin film of PAn.(+)-HCSA or PAn.(-)-HCSA was deposited on ITO-coated glass electrodes using 25 mC/cm2 electrodeposition charge, giving a thickness of ca. 100 nm. Remarkably, strongly optically active PAn.HA films of the same hand as the chiral inducer were produced during the second stage electrodepositions (another 100 mC/cm2) using (&#177;)-HCSA or achiral acids. A possible mechanism for this chiral induction is discussed. Experiments using deposition charges of between 50 and 300 mC/cm2 in the second electrodeposition showed that induction by the thin PAn.(+)-HCSA film occurred undiminished for final films as thick as 700 nm. This novel asymmetric synthesis method presents potential applications such as using thin chiral polyaniline films as inducers for the electrochemical asymmetric synthesis of other chiral conducting polymers. The fully sulfonated polyaniline poly(2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) was found in Chapter 5 to be remarkably resistant to alkaline de-doping, even in 3 M NaOH or conc. NH4OH. Instead of de-doping to the corresponding emeraldine base, UVvisible spectral studies showed that a change of conformation for the polyaniline chains from an &#8220;extended coil&#8221; to a &#8220;compact coil&#8221; arrangement occurred. However, when the sterically crowed amines tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (Bu4NOH) and diisopropylamine were added to aqueous PMAS, de-doping of the &#8220;compact coil&#8221; emeraldine salt to emeraldine base was observed (pH &#8805;11.5), as evidenced by the appearance of a characteristic absorption band at ca. 630 nm. The resistance to dedoping in NaOH and NH4OH may therefore be associated with the electrostatic binding of the relatively small Na+ and NH4 + ions to sulfonate (SO3 -) groups on the PMAS chains, which is sterically hindered for the larger ammonium ions. The redox switching properties of PMAS were also investigated in Chapter 5. The oxidation behaviour of PMAS was similar to that previously observed for unsubstituted polyaniline. However, an unexpected sharp peak at 408 nm was observed for the reduced leucoemeraldine base (LB) form of PMAS generated by treatment with aqueous hydrazine, together with the usual 330 nm peak of LB assigned as a &#960;-&#960;* transition. Thermochromism and solvatochromism of the reduced PMAS species was observed involving reversible interconversion between the 408 nm and 330 nm species. These phenomena may involve a  earrangement of the PMAS eucoemeraldine base chains between two conformations.A novel chiral composite is prepared in Chapter 6 by mixing aqueous solutions of PMAS and poly-L-lysine (PLL) and casting as films. The highest degree of chiral induction in the PMAS-PLL films was observed using a PMAS/PLL molar ratio of 1. The electrical conductivity of the PMAS-PLL (1:1) films was ca. 4 x 10-3 S/cm, an order of magnitude less than PMAS itself. The chiral PLL in the complex is believed to induce optical activity into the main chain of the PMAS moiety, as evidenced by its CD spectrum in visible region. The observed optical activity of the PMAS-PLL films may arise from the PMAS chains adopting a one-handed helical structure due to electrostatic interactions between free sulfonic acid groups on the PMAS with ammonium side chain groups on the PLL. The PMAS-PLL composite films remained optically active during treatment with 1.0 M NH4OH and when reduced with hydrazine or oxidized with ammonium persulfate.The temperature employed in the electrochemical polymerization of aniline is found in Chapter 7 to have a critical effect upon the chiroptical properties of PAn.(+)-HCSA films deposited on ITO-coated glass from aqueous 0.2 M aniline/1.0 M (+)-HCSA. Films grown at elevated temperatures (35-65&#176;C) have inverted CD spectra compared to analogous films grown at lower temperatures (0-25&#176;C). These observations are explained in terms of a temperature-induced interconversion between two diastereomeric emeraldine salt products during the doping of the growing polyaniline chains with the chiral (+)-CSA- anion. The critical effect of polymerization temperature found in this study highlights the importance of employing a controlled temperature during electrochemical synthesis of optically active polyanilines.The influence of solvents on the chiroptical properties of PAn.(+)-HCSA emeraldine salt films prepared in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 8. Polymerizations at high temperature (50-55&#176;C) are required for dissolution of the (+)-HCSA (0.5 M) in all ionic liquids studied, except for (-)-MBEA-TFSI in which solvent HCSA is highly soluble at room temperature. Electroactive polyaniline can be prepared from the electrochemical polymerization of aniline in the presence of (+)-HCSA in the ionic liquids BMI-BF4, BMI-PF6, EMI-TFSI, P13-TFSI and chiral (-)-MBEA-TFSI. Raman spectra of the films generally showed characteristics of meraldine salts, and were very similar to those previously reported for PAn.HCSA synthesized via conventional methods. However, the polymer grown from EMI-TFSI showed different features indicating the presence of unusual chemical structures. These are probably generated by ortho-coupling and crosslinking during electropolymerization. The optical activity of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films grown from EMI-TFSI, BMI-BF4 and P13-TFSI were relatively low, and much less than previously observed for analogous films electrodeposited from aqueous solution, while the emeraldine salt grown from BMI-PF6 was optically inactive. This probably arises from competition between chiral (+)-CSA- and the achiral anions of the ionic liquids (BF4 -, TFSI-, PF6-) as the dopant incorporated into the polymer during polymerization. An attempt to prepare a chiral emeraldine salt from electrochemical polymerization of aniline with racemic (&#177;)-HCSA using the novel chiral ionic liquid (-)-MBEA-TFSI as electrolyte was unsuccessful. Anodic degradation during polymerization at high positive potential (+1.3 V) apparently generated low molecular weight polyaniline oligomers whose length may be too short to maintain a helical structure, as the green product dissolved/dispersed in the polymerization solution.The electrochemical and chiroptical properties of chiral PAn.(+)-HCSA emeraldine salts prepared in aqueous (+)-camphorsulfonic acid and investigated in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 9. The nature of the ionic liquids employed and the applied potential have a marked effect on the stability of the chiral polyaniline films. Reversible loss of the electroactivity of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films occurred when the polyaniline films were potential cycled in the ionic liquids EMI-TFSI, BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4. Electrochemical degradation of the polyaniline films occurred in EMI-TFSI and MBEA-TFSI electrolytes when they were polarized at high positive potentials (&gt; +1.1V). However, significantly, in BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4 electrolytes the optical activity and electrochemical stability of the polyaniline films were retained at potentials as extreme as + 2.0 V. However, cross-linking involving a phenazine-type structure occured when the PAn.(+)-HCSA films were exposed to high positive potentials in BMI-PF6, as evidenced by their Raman spectra. Racemization of the PAn.(+)-HCSA films occurred when electrochemical reduction was carried out in all of the ionic liquids examined except (+)-, (-)-, or (&#177;)-MBEA-TFSI. In the later ionic liquid electrolyte, strong CD signals were observed for the leucoemeraldine base film formed.  Incorporation of the cation from the ionic liquids during the reduction (rather than expulsion of the (+)-CSA- anion) and resultant swelling of the polyaniline films may be the reason for the racemization observed in the other ionic liquids.These are important observations, since they open the possibility of using such PAn.(+)- HCSA films as chiral electrodes in electrochemical asymmetric syntheses in appropriate ionic liquids. BMI-PF6 and BMI-BF4 appear to have potential as electrolytes in electrochemical asymmetric oxidations (e.g. the oxidation of prochiral sulfides to chiral sulfoxides) at high positive potentials, while MBEA-TFSI would appear useful for electrochemical asymmetric reductions (e.g. the reduction of prochiral ketones to chiral alcohols) at very negative potentials.Electroreduction of carbonyl compounds such as acetophenone and acetylpyridine to alcohols and electrooxidation of organosulfides such as methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfide and methyl-p-tolyl sulfide to the corresponding sulfoxides in ionic liquids are explored in Chapter 10. The expected alcohol products were obtained from potentiostatic reduction of acetophenone and 2-acetylpyridine in EMI-TFSI on glassy carbon electrodes at -1.9 and -1.8 V, respectively. Reduction of 4-acetylpyridine in (-)-MBEATFSI on a glassy carbon electrode at -1.6 V yielded 4-pyridylethanol. However, the optical rotation of the product could not be measured due to interference from the chiral ionic liquid which could not be completely separated from the product. 4- Acetylpyridine was not reduced in (&#177;)-MBEA-TFSI on a PAn.(+)-HCSA modified ITOPt- coated electrode to the corresponding alcohol, the corresponding achiral pinacol being instead formed.Oxidation of methyl 4-nitrophenyl sulfide in EMI-TFSI and methyl-p-tolyl sulfide in BMI-BF4 on glassy carbon electrodes was shown to yield the corresponding sulfoxides products. However, the asymmetric electrosyntheses of these sulfoxides in ionic liquids by using a chiral polyaniline modified electrode was not successful due to oxidative degradation of the polyaniline.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/475</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a capability development model for professional school leaders in Thai education</field><field name="creator">Chongcharoen, Koolchalee</field><field name="description">This study explores questions of how Thai school leaders can be better prepared to respond to reforms that propose decentralization, devolution of authority and organizational structures that favor school-based management (SBM) (See Caldwell &amp; Spinks, 1988). The implementation of SBM is a substantial departure from the historically hierarchical and centralized Thai education bureaucracy. The research explored what capabilities are required for this new environment and suggests a capability development model for professional school leaders in Thailand. The research explored literature on self-managing schools, school-based management and educational reform and found that successful reform was dependent on several factors.  This included collaboration, participatory practices, leadership that utilized skills in involving staff, students and community. There is also a need for the system to recognize the need to support devolution and SBM. The research recognized the importance of systemic change and individual agency and used Anthony Giddens&#8217; notion of structuration as a theoretical tool to explore how leaders should be prepared to respond to systemic and professional changes.The study uses a qualitative methodology using interviews, focus group and reviews of documentation to answer two research questions, 1) What are the key capabilities that Thai school leaders should have in relation to the values and visions of multiple stakeholders in Thai education? 2) What forms of professional development are required for a capability development model which can sustain multiple stakeholders in a global world? The purposive sampling was employed to select fifty participants who were experts and the stakeholders.Consistent with the notion of structuration, the data indicated that the structural changes associated with education reform are strongly related to changes of the power and the responsibility of the individuals in the system. The data suggests that there is a need for shifts in behaviors that favors collaboration, participatory practices, visionary leadership and involvement of teachers and the community in school management. This is contradicted by a culture of compliance to superiors and a culture of deference that makes involvement difficult. The findings also showed that bureaucracy and strong hierarchies, which have characterized Thai public institutions, has had a strong influence on the national culture which in turn is a key influence on personality and character for Thais. This feature is seen in this study as an ongoing tension and future concern for Thai school leaders&#8217; capability development.The research found that there is strong support for SBM and that the need for reform is appreciated, there exists strong reservations about the capabilities required to implement change and SBM. The research focused on identifying the capabilities across the system as suggested by leaders, teachers and administrators and the research also looked at what capabilities were needed by these groups to implement SBM.The research also identified the need for more democratic and participatory structures that enabled school leaders to develop a wider repertoire of skills and capabilities. The research proposes a model of capability development, which identified areas for systematic and individual development.The data indicated that the three specific roles were considered essential for Thai school leaders, which are educational strategic thinking, building and managing a collaborative school culture, and providing educational leadership in school in these circumstances.  The key findings showed that the nine domains of professional capability were required to support these new roles namely: change management; strategic thinking; pedagogical content knowledge; facilitating continuous learning and development; working collaboratively with others; communication and interpersonal skill; student and customer focus and quality; self efficacy; and personal integrity.The research identified the need for continuous professional development that included work-based learning, mentoring and features a modeling collaborative and participatory practice using communities of practice and authentic learning tasks. This is in contrast to current practice, which lacks professional development or favors passive modes of learning. The research finds that to foster and sustain capability development in this model, it requires the system development to create the ways or methods for school leaders&#8217; growth. Finally, the thesis suggests that the Thai government should establish the national program for school leaders&#8217; development, which works with the existing leadership-training providers in a networking system. Such a proposed network should focus on the development of the curriculum for serving the individual&#8217;s needs and the techniques for school leaders&#8217; capability development in the attainment of such capabilities. Such programs should utilize a framework proposed in this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/790</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contribution to securing wireless mesh networks</field><field name="creator">Qazi, Shams Ud Din</field><field name="description">A wireless mesh network (WMN) comprises of mesh access points (MAPs)/mesh routers and mesh clients (MCs), where MAPs are normally static and they form the backbone of WMNs. MCs are wireless devices and dynamic in nature, communicating among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths, with or without the help of MAPs. Security has been a primary concern in order to provide protected communication in WMNs due to the open peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints and highly dynamic environment. These challenges clearly make a case for building multi-layer security solution that achieves both wide-range protection and desirable network performance.In this thesis, we attempt to provide necessary security features to WMNs routing operations in an efficient manner. To achieve this goal, first we will review the literature about the WMNs in detail, like WMN&#8217;s architecture, applications, routing protocols, security requirements. Then, we will propose two different secure routing protocols for WMNs which provide security in terms of routing, data and users as well.The first protocol is a cross-layer secure protocol for routing, data exchange and Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) problems (in case of LAN based upon WMNs). Our protocol is a ticket-based ad hoc on demand distance vector (TAODV) protocol, a secure routing protocol that is based on the design of the Ad Hoc on demand distance vector (AODV) protocol. Due to the availability of a backbone, we incorporate the Authentication Server (AS) for the issuance of tickets which are further used for secure routing, transfer of public keys and MAC addresses in one single step. By incorporating the public keys, source and destination can easily generate their shared secret key based upon Fixed Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol for data encryption and decryption. Our protocol is secure against both active as well as passive attacks.The second proposed protocol is to &#8220;achieve user anonymity in WMNs&#8221;. This protocol is also ticket-based protocol. The ticket is issued by Network Operator (NO) which provides user anonymity, user authentication and data confidentiality/privacy throughout the WMN. Our protocol is inspired by the blind Nyberg-Rueppel digital signature scheme. In this protocol NO issues tickets to valid users only and these users can then use these tickets to access Internet or to access services provided by Internet Gateway (IGW). IGW can only verify these tickets whether tickets are valid or not but can not check &#8220;Identity of ticket holder&#8221;.

We introduce cyclotomy and show how such sequences together with a search through incidence matrices of cyclotomic or generalised cosets can be used to find a variety of new combinatorial designs. These designs include new weighing matrices, orthogonal designs and D-optimal designs.In particular we give:&#8226; T-matrices of order n for n = 13,19,31,37,41,42,43,61,66,86,87.&#8226; Weighing matrices W(4n, 4n - 2) and W(4n, 2n - 1) for n = 25,31,37,41,61,71,73,157.&#8226; D-optimal designs of order v = 2 = 31,33,37,41,43,61,73,85,91,93,113,145,157,181.We review some of the Stanton-Spratt-Whiteman constructions for difference sets and show how they can be applied to construct supplementary difference sets. We also give many other infinite families of supplementary difference sets and pairwise balanced designs with .A = 1. The thesis concludes with some discussions about low autocorrelation in cryptography and a presentation of a small one-key cryptosystem.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2008</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In terms most familiar: technologies of whiteness in Australia and Canada: a comparative analysis</field><field name="creator">Salter, Colin</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the implications of colonial whiteness in the actions of communities supporting the struggles of First Peoples in Australia and Canada. Exploring how whiteness manifests itself, how it permeates as epistemic blank spots into the actions of those promoting respect and recognition, is used as a basis to reflect on social justice in contemporary society.The emerging field of critical whiteness studies provides a solid foundation to engage with whiteness. Scholarship on the hegemony of technological discourse is drawn from to extend on this foundation. The notion of human history as a history of progress and the associated scientific hierarchisation of knowledges is rooted in relations of power|knowledge that perpetuate culturally inappropriate colonial relationships.1 Gene Sharp&#8217;s work on consent theories of power and Jacques Ellul&#8217;s engagement with Technological Society are engaged with to explore how such hierarchisation of knowledges is maintained. The pervasiveness of this relation is explored in three case studies to reflect on the implications.Engagement with white interpretations of the 1966 walk-out of Aboriginal stockworkers and their families at Wave Hill provides an historical grounding of contemporary whiteness. Interpretations of the walk-out as a strike that later shifted in focus, counter to oral historical accounts, are used as a basis to consider how manifestations of whiteness in Australia have shifted in the last 40 years. The 2001 formation of the Community Picket at Sandon Point, as a means to oppose a residential proposal, provides a focus for reflecting on whiteness in contemporary Australia. The Picket was established to offer support to the Sandon Point Aboriginal Tent Embassy (SPATE) and promote a progressive variant of &#8216;practical reconciliation&#8217;. Friends of the Red Hill Valley&#8217;s support for Haudenosaunee Treaty rights, in opposing an expressway proposal for the valley, is comparatively engaged with to reflect on contextual variations in how whiteness manifests itself in Australia and Canada. Exposing the actions of white supporters as counter-hegemonic and a challenge to aspects of whiteness whilst unintentionally maintaining unjust colonial relationships at the same time locates some of the challenges for both scholarship and action in the area of social justice. 1 Nikolas Rose, following Foucault and focussing on (self) governance and freedom, refers to the study of such changes as a genealogy (1999: 65-6).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3025</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The power of positive thinking: the effects of self-esteem, explanatory style, and trait hope on emotional wellbeing</field><field name="creator">Davies, Fiona Jane</field><field name="description">Historically, personality and psychopathology have been viewed as conceptually distinct, but recently there have been calls for integrative models. Similarly, the traditional view of mental disorders has been that they are qualitatively different to normal mental states. However, this view has recently changed with a consensus starting to emerge that emotional wellbeing and psychopathology are on a continuum. In particular, the tripartite model of Clarke and Watson (1994) has been influential in understanding the links between affect and psychopathology, proposing that high negative affectivity is related to both anxiety and depression, and low positive affectivity only to depression. Longitudinal research over multiple time points is needed in order to clarify the above relationships and their trajectories over time, as well as to address the nature of developmental change and stability.Despite this, there is little research available on the link between emotional wellbeing&#8212;particularly specific emotional states such as sadness&#8212;and mental health over time. In addition, many personality variables have been studied in relation to mental health that have not had the same attention in the realm of emotional wellbeing. This thesis examines one such group of variables and their relationship to emotional wellbeing. Appraisal theories suggest a link between emotional states and the perceptions of events, and the variables included in this research come from this tradition. The phrase &#8216;positive thinking&#8217; is used in this thesis to refer to cognitive styles that involve positive appraisals of the self, the world, or the future. The specific constructs studied provide a mix of two well-established and widely studied variables (self-esteem and explanatory style) and one newer and less studied variable (trait hope).  Study 1 examined the cross-sectional relationship between the three positive thinking variables and four emotional states (fear, sadness, hostility, and joviality) among 785 Year 7 students. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis suggest that the three positive thinking variables are distinct, as do the different patterns of relationships between the positive thinking variables and the emotional states.Study 2 included 660 of the same students one year later in order to examine the longitudinal relationship between the positive thinking variables and emotional wellbeing. When all three positive thinking variables were included in the structural equation models, there were unique effects for each variable. Specifically, high self-esteem predicted lower fear and sadness, high trait hope predicted increased joviality, and positive explanatory style predicted lower hostility one year later. The positive thinking variables showed moderate stability over time, broadly consistent with prior research. Overall, the results of this thesis indicate that self-esteem, explanatory style, and trait hope have important and unique effects on emotional wellbeing in early adolescence. These findings have implications for clinical practice, particularly for prevention and early interventions programs for anxiety and depression. The reasons for the specific relationships found in this thesis remain unclear, and further development of the theoretical and research base in this area would be worthwhile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3038</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploratory study of mental health problems and types of treatment used in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Koka, Betty E</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea (PNG) is culturally diverse with an estimated 800 distinct languages and a population of 5 million people. These diverse cultures and languages influence help-seeking behaviour, expressions of illness, presentation of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment decisions. In addition to the complex influence of culturallinguistic factors on mental health and illness, inadequate resources limit PNG&#8217;s specialist mental health services. PNG has one psychiatrist per million people and one registered psychiatric nurse for every 70,000 people. As a result, the bulk of mental health care is provided by general health workers in various types of health care facilities in the community. Little is known about the types of mental health problems and treatment approaches adopted by health workers in the field. There is evidence from studies in other developing countries that general health workers lack understanding and knowledge in mental health issues and this limits their ability to make appropriate diagnoses and deliver appropriate treatments. Earlier studies in Papua New Guinea (PNG) have described mental health problems seen by psychiatrists. However, the types of mental health problems and treatment approaches used by general health workers have not been assessed. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the types of mental health problems and treatments that general health workers work with in PNG. The study also sought to assess general health workers levels of knowledge and confidence in understanding and managing mental health problems. The study recruited 209 general health workers including, health extension officers (HEOs), nursing officers (NOs) and community health workers (CHWs) from a range of health care settings. This study used a three-part questionnaire that included a combination of structured questions written in both English and Neo-Melanesian (Tok Pisin). Part 1 assessed health workers knowledge and confidence in diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. Part 2 asked them to provide a detailed review of the three most recent mental health cases they had managed. Part 3 involved pre-post workshop assessment of knowledge and skill using participant responses to three video case vignettes that were role-played in Tok Pisin. Data was collected from the four regions of PNG at four 5-day long regional mental health-training workshops. Pre-post training measures were collected to evaluate the difference of training at improving diagnosis and treatment approaches suggested by participants in response to the video-case vignettes. The results showed that general health workers had received little training in mental health issues and that they tended to lack confidence in identifying and managing mental health problems. Respondents provided data on 282 patients and results indicated that patients on their caseloads frequently received both western and culture specific diagnoses. The most common diagnoses were schizophrenia, depression, substance use disorder, sorcery and spirit possession. The most common treatment approach used was medication. Medication use appeared to be based on what was available rather than effectiveness and appropriateness. Those diagnosed with a culture specific disorder were almost twice as likely to receive traditional treatment and even half of those who did not receive a culture specific diagnosis went on to receive some form of traditional treatment. Psychological treatment (counselling) was also commonly used as part of the treatment process. Pre-training measures assessing video case vignettes had high numbers of &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; responses suggesting a lack of confidence and knowledge regarding diagnosis and treatment planning. At the post-training assessments the number of &#8220;don&#8217;t know&#8221; responses decreased suggesting increases in confidence, but there were also increases in the provision of the &#8220;correct&#8221; diagnosis and more appropriate treatments for some cases. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to training needs of general health workers and the provision of culturally appropriate treatment approaches. Specifically, suggestions are made for better integrating policy recommendations regarding the implementation of traditional treatment of mental health problems with western mental health approaches.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/771</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward a reinforcement-sensitive psychophysiological model for health-related behaviours and health communications</field><field name="creator">Aslam, Mubeen M</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores the hypothesised role of psychobiological personality dimensions in shaping specific health-related behaviours and propositions potential health communications. The primary aim was to investigate Eysenck&#8217;s and Gray&#8217;s personality dimensions in relationship to specific smoking, alcohol-use, substance-use, physical exercise and eating behaviours. Past research has either focussed on a narrow range of behaviours or examined the relation between personality, health behaviours and message interventions insufficiently. It is argued that most health behaviours are a function of psychophysiological processes and social learning, and future research should find them differentially conditionable by appropriate punishment- or reward-oriented messages.The dissertation draws on the Hippocrates-Galen-Avicennic tradition and the works of Pavlov, Skinner, Mowrer, Eysenck and Gray, and examines the previously ignored work of Avicenna on human temperament and emotions. A taxonomy of health-related behaviours and a framework for health communication and behaviour change are presented. The behavioural taxonomy of Indulgent-Denial, Delinquent-Inert, and Escape-Maintenance is assessable by physiological and psychological markers, and corresponds to Eysenck&#8217;s three-dimensional personality structure. The partly validated model explains behavioural variations by composites of nervous conduction and reactivity of behavioural systems in the brain, and also outlines possible communication interventions.The dissertation is anchored in positivism, assuming intrinsic biogenetic influences as the psychophysiological reality. A retrospective Study consisting of a single cross-sectional survey explored the multivariate relationship between the psychobiological personality dimensions and health-related behaviours in a student sample. In line with the protocols approved by the Ethics Committee, two standard personality instruments, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised and the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire, and an especially developed Behavioural Questionnaire provided the self-report measurements. Demographic effects on behavioural and personality variables were discovered by chi-square tests and two-way multivariate analysis of variance respectively, associations between variables were observed by correlational analysis, likelihood of a specific behaviour on the basis of personality variables was examined by a logistic model, and health diagnostic accuracies of personality measures were assessed by Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.It was found that high Extraversion and high Psychoticism scorers, and so Indulgent and Delinquent Behaviours were more likely to show appetitive associations, whereas high Neuroticism scorers and thereby Escape Behaviours were more likely to show aversive associations. All Eysenckian dimensions revealed low-to-moderate Reward-sensitivity while Neuroticism showed combined strengths of Punishment- and Reward-sensitivity. The intercorrelations of personality dimensions supported Gray that the Eysenckian dimensions probably represent unequal mixtures of Punishment- and Reward-sensitivity. The associations between personality and behaviours indicate Reward-sensitivity and Psychoticism as the most useful personality disorder dimensions, and the research questions the often-attributed role of Extraversion as a cardinal well-being dimension. Statistically and practically significant relationships between Extraversion and alcohol-use, Psychoticism and heavy alcohol-use, Psychoticism and substance-use, Psychoticism and heavy substance-use, and Neuroticism and binge-eating were observed, but the health diagnostic accuracies of personality measures were mostly poor and the correlations and odds ratios between personality and behavioural data were subject to a ceiling effect. The thesis questions whether personality measures may be a data collection method and not a diagnostic test for health-related behaviours. It is argued that personality data alone may be of insufficient diagnostic value in clinical decision-making and healthcare setting.Thus, the dissertation asserts that health-risk behaviours will be best understood when examined in relation to the reinforcement-sensitive behavioural systems in brain and the contexts in which these behaviours occur. A psychophysiological framework of behavioural assessment and modification is advisable instead of strict personality-based models or a one-size-fits-all approach, in view of theoretical and empirical knowledge about the neuronal growth through life, nerve physiology, early childhood development, relationships between conscious and unconscious processes, the anachronistic assumption of immutability of personality traits as risk factors, results of the data analysis and the observation that health-risk behaviours are of different types and should entail differential emotional appeals. The thesis has created an architecture for future behavioural research with an emphasis on systematic punishment- or reward-oriented health communication interventions, an area that has received comparatively little empirical attention.KEY WORDS: Behavioural Epidemiology, Behavioural Medicine, Health Communication, Personality Factors in Health and Behaviour Change, Population Health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3062</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harvesting heterogeneity to attract volunteers: an investigation of alternative segmentation bases and approaches</field><field name="creator">Randle, Melanie Joy</field><field name="description">The present research project grew out of a practical problem being experienced by a local environmental volunteering organisation &#8211; how to attract and retain volunteers. The purpose of the study was to gain insight into the volunteering market by investigating whether understanding of systematic heterogeneity among volunteers can be harvested to attract more volunteers from non-traditional groups within the community. This involved investigating a number of different segmentation criteria hypothesised to be relevant to the behaviour of volunteering, to identify the most managerially useful approach to the development of targeted recruitment campaigns. Four separate investigations were conducted. Study 1 qualitatively investigated the role of ethnic identification in volunteering behaviour, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour as the theoretical framework for the enquiry. Results indicated that while differences were found between ethnic groups, heterogeneity within ethnic groups was so high that treating them as separate distinct market segments was not a feasible marketing strategy. Findings from Study 1 did, however, point to other potentially valuable segmentation criteria, especially bicultural identity, family life stage and image beliefs towards the organisation.  Studies 2 and 3 investigated additional segmentation criteria which emerged both from Study 1 and prior literature. Family life stage, bicultural identity and images beliefs towards volunteering organisations were explored using quantitative data from an Australian sample of 1,415 participants. Segmenting the volunteer market based on (1) family life stage and (2) bicultural identity (Study 2) produced distinct groups of volunteers which could be used for market targeting. Yet, these segment profiles appeared to be strongly influenced by image beliefs towards volunteering organisations. Consequently, Study 3 focused on using image beliefs towards the organisation as the key segmentation variable. This analysis led to a number of valuable insights into the structure of the volunteering market. Firstly, different generic image positions were found to exist in the volunteering market, indicating that a limited number of particular combinations of image beliefs can be used to characterise volunteering organisations. Secondly, certain volunteering organisations are more strongly associated with particular generic image positions than others, indicating that they do actually possess distinct brand images. Thirdly, preference levels for individual volunteering organisations differ at different generic image positions. This information enables volunteering organisations to understand which generic image positions are seen most favourably for them by the market. Heterogeneity based on image beliefs towards organisations thus emerged as the most managerially useful source of heterogeneity to form the basis of a volunteering segmentation. Finally, in Study 4 the results derived from Studies 2 and 3 using exploratory methodology were tested, using the Theory of Planned Behaviour. If harvesting systematic heterogeneity among volunteers is a superior strategy to mass marketing to attract volunteers, the predictive power of regression models accounting for this heterogeneity should be higher than that of models that assume that all volunteers are driven by the same degree of attitude, social norm and perceived behavioural control. Results indicate that the predictive power of the theory was greater when applied at the segment level, particularly for segments based on image beliefs towards organisations. This supports the conclusion that segmenting the market based on image beliefs towards organisations results in the greatest insight for managers, and is the criterion most able to harvest heterogeneity to attract more volunteers from the general community. The results of this study contribute to theory in three ways. Firstly, novel sources of heterogeneity are investigated to assess their effectiveness in identifying subgroups within the volunteering market which are homogeneous in their volunteering behaviour. Secondly, the assumption that general volunteering behaviour is indicative of volunteering behaviour for specific organisations is challenged, therefore questioning the validity of much of the current research on volunteering which typically uses volunteering behaviour in general as a proxy to predict and explain heterogeneity in volunteering behaviour for specific causes. Thirdly, the Theory of Planned Behaviour is expanded to account for heterogeneity, and an additional construct &#8211; image beliefs towards organisations &#8211; is added to improve the predictive ability of the model. Results are important for volunteering managers because they provide insight into ways of segmenting the volunteer market to identify groups which are homogeneous in their attitudes and volunteering behaviour. This subsequently allows managers to (1) identify the generic image position which is most preferred for their organisation and provide direction as to the type of brand and image attributes that they should be promoting; (2) understand which people are most likely to volunteer for their organisation; and (3) understand how to reach these people and the messages which would be most meaningful and motivating for them. Ultimately, this information enables more efficient spend of the limited marketing dollars available, and maximises the number of volunteers recruited and retained by volunteering organisations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/56</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The larrikin subject: hegemony and subjectivity in late nineteenth century Sydney</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kylie</field><field name="description">The problem of social disorder has figured prominently in Australian historiography and in contemporary social theorising. However, the traditional categories of historical analysis provide a limited set of tools through which to understand the complexities of human behaviour in the past. By writing a social ontology into history, it is possible to rethink how &#8216;ways of being&#8217; in the world are both constructed and represented, and to reconsider the consequences of this for our understanding of both history and the present.The way in which certain types of social disorder have been analysed in Australian history has meant that some social groups, or behavioural types, have been marginalised and excluded. This is the case with the figure of &#8216;the larrikin&#8217;, a common type in Australian historiography, yet represented in such a way that our understanding of them today bears little resemblance to the way in which they were understood in their own time. This discrepancy has been brought about through the tendency of some historical approaches to focus on the institutions and structures of nation building, or on the recognisably political forms of &#8216;organised labour&#8217;. This type of analysis can only take our understanding of human behaviour so far.Psychoanalytic theory as developed by Freud and Lacan helps to show the way in which &#8216;civilised society&#8217; relies on the repression and sublimation of &#8216;instinctual&#8217; types of human behaviour, but that in so doing, a part of the human self is excluded. This exclusion occurs at both the personal and the social level, as the &#8216;civilised&#8217; self, the &#8216;civilised society&#8217;, can only exist against what it has excluded. This psychoanalytic theory is linked with the work of Antonio Gramsci to show that what is excluded, and the process of exclusion, is related to the process of establishing hegemony, and that the resultant exclusion is the basis of subalternity.In late nineteenth century Sydney, the term &#8216;larrikinism&#8217; came to represent a particular set of behaviours which were considered problematic for the development of &#8216;civilised society&#8217;. An examination of the hegemonic mechanisms by which the exclusion of larrikin behaviour could occur, demonstrates that the imagination of a civilised society in late nineteenth century Sydney was centred around certain hegemonic principles which required a particular kind of human self &#8211; a disciplined worker, a desiring consumer &#8211; and suggests that larrikins resisted this process. Larrikins were made subaltern because they were a form of &#8216;subjectivity&#8217;, or a way of being in the world, that sought to challenge the making of a kind of human self considered necessary for industrial capitalism. In this way, larrikin behaviour can be understood as a type of &#8216;excess&#8217;, a frontier in the battle for hegemony around notions of youth, respectability and discipline.This historical process did not stop in 1899 but continued into the twentieth century and beyond, and continues to have ramifications for the way in which we think notions of politics and agency, and for the ways in which subaltern groups in contemporary society continue to be marginalised and excluded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/87</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing environmental turbulence in the microfinance sector - a case study of the Aga Khan rural support programme in Pakistan</field><field name="creator">Khan, Ashfaq A</field><field name="description">Microfinance is a powerful development tool with which to alleviate the problem ofpoverty through providing financial services to the poor. The real essence of allmicrofinance efforts around the world is to enable the poor to break the cycle of poverty by establishing and nourishing small businesses. The international donor community1 and governments have had substantial financial and non-financial investments in developing and providing subsidized financial services for the poor on the premise thatthey have limited access to the formal mainstream financial institutions.There was a drastic shift in the microfinance paradigm during the early 1990s when the donor community changed its thinking and approach as to the sustainability ofmicrofinance institutions around the world. Instead of providing subsidized financialservices to microfinance institutions (MFIs) for their life time, the donors startedemphasizing self-sustainability on the part of MFIs through cost control, efficientoperations, and adopting commercialism. The shift in the donors&#8217; approach, in turn,resulted in competition among MFIs as they had to struggle for more and more clientsto ensure their sustainability. These new issues came as external disturbances for theMFIs which were previously heavily dependent on the donors&#8217; subsidized funding, and they had to adapt and reorient to the changed external conditions.This study is a case study based on the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) &#9472; one of the prominent microfinance institutions in Pakistan. It explores the internal adaptation and reorientation of the Programme&#8217;s microfinance division in response to these changed external circumstances. The study has two different aspects; first, the internal adaptation and reorientation of the microfinance division of the AKRSP to the changed external circumstances and, second, its passive submission to the changed environmental conditions. Therefore, the study resorted to two theoretical frameworks &#9472; Laughlin&#8217;s (1991) Model of Organizational Change and Institutional Theory (DiMaggio and Powel, 1983) to placate the two aspects of the research issue. The study provides insights into the successful adaptation of the AKRSP in which it had to tailor all of its tangible and intangible organizational elements in response to the changed external conditions to ensure its survival and sustainability.The study examines the process of transformation of the subject as it changed from a donor based institution to a sustainable, commercial institution. The study draws parallels between the theories of Laughlin, and DiMaggio and Powell, and the events that took place during this transformation.Key words: microfinance, sustainability, commercialism, organizational change.1 The term &#8216;international donor community&#8217;, referred to as &#8216;donors&#8217;, &#8216;donor community&#8217;, or &#8216;donoragencies&#8217; in the thesis, connotes international sources of subsidized funding for the poor.

Using initial collaborations with my 5-year-old daughter as a conceptual trajectory, I began to explore domestic rhythms and the communality of multiple objects. Ceramic artist Angela Valamanesh and &#8216;Outsider&#8217; Howard Finster were found to represent the polarities &#8211; austere and chaotic &#8211; of repetition. Artistic engagement with the congenital temperament of a child initiated a return to base sculptural principles, bare materials and processes, pre-dating history and evoking the archetype of childhood. This considered regression led to the development of an exploratory ceramic practise upon the beaches, bush and farmland of South Coast New South Wales, culminating in the ephemeral performance object of a ceramic pit-fire. Formally, I have adopted the universal anthropomorphism of the vessel, consciously grouped and presented as the individual members of small &#8216;communities&#8217;. This method of production resolved itself in the suggestive vacancy of the &#8216;dwelling&#8217;, and the discovery of a largely undocumented international tendency within contemporary art.

The cleaning workers in this study were from three sectors of the workforce &#8211; government schools, hospitality and commercial office space. The vacuum cleaning tasks were divided into those performed with a back pack style vacuum cleaning machine and those using a canister/barrel machine. Three observational risk assessment tools were selected to measure the risk of these tasks to cleaning workers. The selected tools were the Manual Tasks Risk Assessment Tool (ManTRA) version 2.0; the Quick Exposure Check (QEC) (Li &amp; Buckle, 1998); and the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment tool (RULA) (McAtamney &amp; Corlett, 1993). Results of this thesis study demonstrated that vacuum cleaning is a risk to the musculoskeletal health of cleaning workers, with some variation between the tool ratings, reflecting the specificity and/or sensitivity of each tool. Differences were found between the three cleaning sectors in terms of overall risk posed by vacuum cleaning tasks. The sector with the greatest risk was found to be the government school cleaners, followed by the hospitality and then commercial office space cleaning sectors. The &#8216;risk experience&#8217; difference between the sectors cannot be attributed only to vacuum cleaner characteristics, but also, the environment and length of shift worked by the cleaning staff. Further research is required to determine the difference in risk exposure between the two types of vacuum cleaner (back pack and canister).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/126</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diagnosing potential: preservice teachers' understanding and expectations of students with learning disabilities</field><field name="creator">Woodcock, Stuart</field><field name="description">The current study was conducted to investigate preservice teachers&#8217; understandings and expectations of students with learning disabilities. Attributional responses that teachers construct result in differing teacher affect, evaluative feedback and expectation of future performance. Once these understandings and expectations are embedded they are less likely to change over the span of a teaching career. This study therefore examined preservice teachers&#8217; attributional responses to boys with a learning disability who had failed a class test. Preservice teachers&#8217; attitudes towards students with learning disabilities, and their teacher efficacy were also explored in relation to their attributional responses. The instructional strategies that preservice teachers report they would use for students with learning disabilities were also considered.Six hundred-sixty-seven preservice primary and secondary school teachers within New South Wales were studied across four University Campuses. Five kinds of instruments were administered to the subjects of the study: a demographic questionnaire, an attributional vignettes questionnaire, an attitudes questionnaire, a teacher efficacy scale questionnaire, and, an instructional strategies questionnaire. Each University within New South Wales is required, by the Department of Education and Training (DET), to include a compulsory inclusive education subject within their course design. To investigate the influence that the compulsory inclusive education subject has on preservice teachers, the study included preservice teachers who had and had not completed the subject.The results of the study showed that preservice teachers form a negative attribution cycle about students with a learning disability, which is in stark contrast to the positive attribution cycle that they form about students without a learning disability. The findings show that preservice teachers view students with a learning disability more from a medical model viewpoint that emphasises deficits. Thus, they are generally more positive towards students with a learning disability, less frustrated, more sympathetic, and have lower expectations of their future performances. Philosophically, their educational view towards students with a learning disability is driven by ability, rather than effort, which is in contrast to their view towards students without a learning disability. Preservice teachers also report they would use more teacher-centred instructional strategies for students with learning disabilities, in comparison to using higher cognitive level instructional strategies in a student-centred environment for students without a learning disability. The application of teacher efficacy to this study suggested that preservice teachers who believed, and were confident in their own teaching abilities, were more likely to have a greater academic focus on classroom instructional strategies and outcomes. Similarly, preservice teachers with a greater positive attitude towards students with a learning disability had higher expectations of these students and reported greater use of higher cognitive level instructional strategies in a student-centred environment.Finally, the study suggests recommendations and implications for practice and future research in regards to understandings and expectations of students with learning disabilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/127</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powerline easements: ecological impacts and effects on small mammal movement</field><field name="creator">Strevens, Tanya C</field><field name="description">Habitat loss and fragmentation are recognised as the two primary threats to biological diversity worldwide. Powerline easements are linear habitat features that occur in all land tenures, including national parks. Where they occur in areas of natural vegetation, the vegetation is periodically mowed to maintain short grassy conditions. This creates a stark discontinuity with the natural vegetation in the area.With the creation of powerline easements comes the simultaneous generation of large tracts of &#8216;edge habitat&#8217; at the boundary between the easement and natural vegetation. In these regions, ecological processes and abiotic conditions can vary considerably from those in the bushland interior, with potentially negative effects on biodiversity. It is important, therefore, to understand the magnitude of the effects of powerline easements. By generating a series of scenarios using GIS, I explored this in a 5,735km2 region of New South Wales that is rich in conservation reserves but highly fragmented by linear anthropogenic features. While the area of habitat replaced by powerline easements was not great (0.57% of all habitat in the study area), the total area of habitat likely to be ecologically affected by these features is very extensive, up to 14,070ha. Powerlines make a substantial contribution to the subdivision of native bushland in this study area.Linear features, such as powerline easements, can inhibit the movement of small mammals. Isolated populations are more vulnerable to extinction as a result of environmental stochasticity (e.g. bushfire, disease), and are also liable to loss of genetic diversity. To quantify the barrier effect posed to small mammals by powerline easements, I conducted a mark-recapture study at four sites over a 2-year period. This revealed an extremely low rate of easement crossing by the two common small mammal species, Rattus fuscipes and Antechinus stuartii, even where vegetation in the linear opening had grown tall and dense. There was some evidence to suggest that when animals did cross from one side of the easement to the other, it tended to be when vegetation was denser. There were generally very few captures of animals in the easements themselves, even where numbers were substantial in the adjacent forest. This suggested that competitive exclusion did not explain the infrequent easement crossings. However, one site in which easement vegetation was well-established, individuals were captured relatively regularly in the easement. As a first step in developing a strategy to mitigate the barrier effect observed, I sought a better understanding of the habitat preferences and movement behaviour of my study species. Using the spool-and-line technique, I followed the paths of spooled animals through the habitat and, at intervals, scored the vegetation in the immediate vicinity of the spool trail. I compared these results to availability of these habitat features in the habitat in order to quantify preferences of the two species for particular microhabitats. Rattus fuscipes responded positively to logs and to higher densities of shrub cover. A preference for areas with higher densities of shrub cover was also identified. Antechinus stuartii exhibited a significant association with leaf litter, and preferential use of larger logs and trunks.Based on the knowledge of these habitat preferences, I constructed two habitat corridors in the easement at each of the four study sites. These &#8216;linkages&#8217; were composed of rows of logs and branches that linked the natural vegetation on the two sides of the easement. After initial experimentation with straight linkages, I incorporated kinks to test more effectively whether spooled animals would follow the course of these structures to the shelter of the adjacent habitat or would ignore the favoured habitat characteristics provided in the linkages. Antechinus stuartii used the linkages more than R. fuscipes; they were less inclined to move away from it and into the easement. While some R. fuscipes individuals did use the linkages either partially or entirely, others strayed from them into the open easement. They strayed significantly further when shrub vegetation in the linkage was dense. Rattus fuscipes was less likely to leave the linkages when they were straight than when there were kinks incorporated into them. The level of ground vegetation had little effect on the distance that R. fuscipes moved away from the linkages following release.The path taken by animals released on linkages, as well as in the open easement was described using a measure of &#8216;tortuosity&#8217;; the numbers of angles in each of four size classes per unit distance. It was then possible to compare the nature of the movement paths of animals in the open easement, on the habitat linkages, and in the adjacent habitat. Overall, the greatest number of turns per metre was made in the open easement, with fewest in the forest habitat. For both R. fuscipes and A. stuartii, the trend was for more of the smallest angles in the open than the habitat, and more large angles in the habitat. I found no significant difference between the open easement and the linkage in terms of the proportions of turns in each angle category for either species.Finally, I carried out a series of translocations of R. fuscipes and A. stuartii to test whether easement crossing could be induced in individuals that usually showed no evidence of inclination to travel into the easement. Selection of habitat characteristics and the tortuosity of the movement path were recorded. More than half of the individuals translocated to the opposite side of the easement returned to their side of origin in 1-5 days. Others may have returned after trapping was concluded or were simply not recaptured during the trapping session. Thus, animals can and will cross the powerline easements. Translocated animals exhibited a more tortuous movement path than animals in familiar habitat, which may be related to searching behaviour as the animal investigates its new environment, perhaps selecting a travel path for the return journey to its home range.Powerlines are a little-studied source of habitat fragmentation, despite the widespread nature of their distribution. Given the barrier effect that has been demonstrated in this study and the potential ecological consequences of this and also of edge effects, these habitat features deserve greater attention. While corridors may in some situations mitigate the barrier effect for native animal species, linkages across powerline easements constructed in this study had little impact on the number of easement crossing events. This suggests that our understanding of what characteristics of natural habitats need to be incorporated into corridors to make them more suitable is insufficient. Closer examination of the factors that influence the movement behaviour of small mammals in a variety of habitat situations will provide useful insights into how management actions could be improved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/691</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work-related learning with the arts: developing work skills with the performing and visual arts</field><field name="creator">Manning, Claire</field><field name="description">the last decade there has been a trend to incorporate the arts into work-related learning. The purpose of this study was to explore work-related learning utilising the arts to determine the benefits of this approach to learning. This study was designed to investigate how work related learners, predominately adult learners, could benefit from learning with artistic processes.This study contributes to the body of knowledge and current limited research available on learning with the arts for work related development. Qualitative research was conducted in two arts environments, visual and performing, that offered work-related learning opportunities. This was undertaken using case study design where nine cases provided a snapshot of what was experienced when involved in work-related learning experiences.An analysis of nine participants&#8217; perceptions of learning with the arts was undertaken firstly by exploring the individual learning from the personal, sociocultural and physical perspective using the Contextual Model of Learning developed by Falk and Dierking (2000). Secondly, to discover the potential of learning with the arts for work related skill development an analysis of the participants&#8217; reflections describing what was gained in these arts learning environments were analysed using the Employability Skills Framework (DEST, 2002).Significant benefits for the individual adult learner are explored as a result of this study. For the workplace, this research presented evidence, based on participant perceptions, that employability skills could be developed when learning with the arts. Such skills identified during this study included assistance in the development of communication, initiative and enterprise, teamwork, self-management and lifelong learning skills.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/693</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human aspects of quality management in developing countries: a case study and model development for Thai manufacturing SMEs</field><field name="creator">Buranajarukorn, Panu</field><field name="description">Thai manufacturing SMEs have played a major role in increasing the Thai GDP and improving international competitiveness. However, there have been many problems inside organisations that have created obstacles to improving performance in both domestic and international markets. Thailand has entered into FTAs with several international trading groups, and has thus been confronted by fierce overseas competitors. However, Thai manufacturing SMEs have lacked investment in modern technology and management techniques. There appears to be a need for Quality Management (QM) that benefits from well-managed Human Factors (HFs). Over the past decade, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been used by many larger Thai enterprises, but there has been a slow up-take in Thai manufacturing SMEs. This PhD work has studied 71 Thai manufacturing SMEs in relation to Human Factors - dependent Quality Management Systems (QMSs). These were in three distinct industry groups; Food and Beverage, Automotive and Auto parts, and Textiles and Garments. In a substantial literature review, 300 references have been consulted. This review showed that management issues were critical in Thai manufacturing SME&#8217;s. Quality Management in particular is largely problematical and a better understanding of the role of human factors is urgently required. Human Factors considered are derived from the seven criteria of the Thailand Quality Award (TQA) and were used as the basis of a questionnaire survey. These were:- Strategic Human Resource Planning, Human Resource Development, Employee Empowerment, Performance Management, Communication and Information Management, Leadership, and Continuous Improvement . In analysing the results of the investigation, ten hypotheses were explored. The most important conclusions were:- &#8226; The importance of human factors problems in Thai manufacturing SMEs is significant (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; Thai manufacturing SMEs that had implemented TQM had established Organisational Aspects, Performance Management, Leadership and QM training that are different to those that had not implemented TQM. (&#8733; = 0.05). &#8226; The level of TQM adoption is not significantly related to the need to upgrade organisational performance, morale, work satisfaction, and work participation. There are significant relationships between morale and work satisfaction (&#945; = 0.05) and work participation and work satisfaction (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; The extent of human factors problems in Food and Beverage industries is significantly different from other industries (&#945; = 0.10). &#8226; Technology-intensive Thai manufacturing SMEs have more highly developed quality management than those that are Labour-intensive (&#945; = 0.01) and also established better performance management systems (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; The outcomes of this research relating to the current status of TQM implementation are useful for Thai manufacturing SMEs considering their problems because their interest in the results of this study was up to 72% (&#945; = 0.05). &#8226; Government assistance programmes were considered by many Thai manufacturing SMEs to be unproductive. Less than 70% of Thai manufacturing SMEs had requested help from government to solve their human factors problems (&#945; = 0.05). In addition, there were perceived gaps between their needs and their conscious need for government assistance (&#945; = 0.05). Therefore, a new approach is required to fill this gap by establishing a productive quality management system. A SWOT analysis was used to identify Strengths and Weaknesses and examine Opportunities and Threats to Thai manufacturing SMEs. It concluded that Thai manufacturing SMEs should consider Human Factors as a major issue in establishing an effective Quality Management System. Three models were developed in this study. The first addresses the main five problems; Quality Practices, Human Resources, Management Functions and Operational Tasks, Basic Infrastructure and Organisational Aspects, and Related Problems which influenced the successful implementation of QM. In response to these, the two other models, Government Assistance Strategies and the Development of a Quality Management System specifically addressing the Human Resource in Thai manufacturing SMEs, have been established. It is concluded that government assistance strategies are necessary to assist Thai manufacturing SMEs in five areas; (1) Communication, Information and Education, (2) Provision of Effective SME Development programmes, (3) Improvement of Work Systems, (4) Establishment of Basic Infrastructure, and (5) Development of Quality Management Systems. Finally, it is emphasised that QMS Development needs to be integrated with HR Development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/694</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An econometric analysis of Thai stock market in the context of global stock market integration</field><field name="creator">Chancharat, Surachai</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an econometric analysis of the Thai stock market in the context of global stock market integration. Chapter 3 examines whether stock prices for 16 countries are trend stationary or follow a random walk process using the Zivot and Andrews (1992) and Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) tests and monthly data spanning December 1987 to April 2007. With one and two structural breaks, the Zivot and Andrews and Lumsdaine and Papell test results provide evidence in favor of the random walk hypothesis in 12 and 11 countries, respectively, out of 16 countries. Thus, based on the empirical results in this chapter, the stock market price indices in the majority of countries analyzed exhibit a random walk. In addition, the key structural break in most of the cases points to the Asian crisis over the period 1996-1998. Chapter 4 investigates the existence of cointegration and causality between the stock market price indices of Thailand and its major trading partners (Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and the United States), using monthly data spanning December 1987 to December 2005. Both the Engle-Granger two-step procedure (assuming no structural breaks) and the Gregory and Hansen (1996) test (allowing for one structural break) provide no evidence of a long-run relationship between the stock prices of Thailand and these countries. Based on the empirical results obtained from these two residual-based cointegration tests, potential long-run benefits exist from diversifying the investment portfolios internationally to reduce the associated systematic risks across countries. However, in the short run, three unidirectional Granger causalities run from the stock returns of Hong Kong, the Philippines and the United Kingdom to those of Thailand, pair-wise. Furthermore, there are two unidirectional causalities running from the stock returns of Thailand to those of Indonesia and the United States. The results also found empirical evidence of bidirectional Granger causality, suggesting that the stock returns of Thailand and three of its neighboring countries (Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan) are interrelated. Chapter 5 explores the relationships between stock market returns of 13 countries based upon monthly data (December 1987 to April 2007). Specifically, the principal component and maximum likelihood methods are used to examine any discernable patterns of stock market co-movements. Factor analysis provides evidence that stock returns in a number of Asian countries are highly correlated and, based on the resulting robust factor loadings, they form the first well-defined common factor. The results also find consistent results (based on both the principal component and maximum likelihood methods) suggesting that the stock returns of all global developed economy stock markets are also highly correlated, and constitute the second factor. That means, inter alia, geographical proximity and the level of economic development do matter when it comes to co-movements of stock returns and this has important implications for financial portfolio diversification if the aim is to reduce systematic risks across countries. Chapter 6 analyzes how 15 international stock markets and five key Thai macroeconomic variables influenced monthly stock market returns in Thailand in the pre- and post-1997 Asian crisis eras. The results indicate that the Singapore stock market influenced the Thai stock market significantly in both the pre- and post-1997 periods. Before 1997 the Indonesian and Malaysian stock markets were significantly related to the Thai stock market, whereas after the crisis Korea and the Philippines played a dominant role in explaining sources of variation in the monthly returns in the Thai stock market. Therefore, to a large extent, one may conclude that the Thai stock market is very much influenced by the performance of its neighboring countries&#8217; stock markets, but non regional markets exerted an insignificant effect. This goes some way to explaining why the financial crisis of 1997 remained a primarily regional crisis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/835</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of nanostructures</field><field name="creator">Baowan, Duangkamon</field><field name="description">Worldwide nanotechnology is a major focus in science and technology, and most research in this area deals with chemical, physical and biological issues or a combination of these areas, but to date very little work has been undertaken on mathematical modelling. Rather than employing large-scale computations using molecular dynamics simulation, in this thesis elementary mechanical principles and classical applied mathematical modelling procedures are utilised to examine three specific areas in nanotechnology.Firstly, the Lennard-Jones potential function for the non-bonded interaction potential energy between two molecules and the continuum approximation, which assumes that the interatomic interactions can be modelled by smearing the atoms uniformly across surfaces, are undertaken to investigate the mechanical properties of certain nanostructures, namely double-walled carbon nanotubes, nanopeapods, nanocones and carbon onions. O wing to their special mechanical, electrical and thermal properties, these nanostructures promise many applications for future nanoscale devices, such as nano-bearings and nano-oscillators. This thesis examines issues regarding nano-oscillators constructed from these nanostructures. In particular, the van derWaals interaction energy, the suction energy, the o&#174; set location and the oscillatory behaviour are determined. Analytical expressions are obtained as a function of the radii and the lengths of the structures. In addition, all the predicted mechanical properties derived here are in excellent agreement with results from molecular dynamics simulations.The second area is the joining of nanostructures by invoking the principle that the atoms arrange themselves in such a way that the total squared deviation of the distance between atoms at the junction and some ideal bond length is a minimum. Initially, toroidal molecules are described, which are formed from three distinct carbon nanotube sections, through minimisation of the total squared deviation of the distance between two carbon atoms at the junction from the ideal physical bond length. Representative formulae for the mean generating toroidal radius and tube radius of the tori are determined. Following this is to determine the perpendicular joining structures for carbon nanotubes and flat graphene by two least squares approaches, which are the variation in bond length and the variation in bond angle. Such a combined structure might constitute a transmission platform for ultra small computer chips. Given that the corresponding boron nitride nanostructures are also good semiconductors, the corresponding combined structures are also determined. However, the essential mathematical ideas for combining boron nitride structures are quite different to those required for connecting the corresponding carbon structures, since only rings with an even number of sides are energetically favourable.The third area in this thesis involves the elastic model of carbon nanotubes. Here, carbon nanotubes are assumed to be modelled as transversely isotropic linearly elastic materials which have the same properties in one plane, but vary in the normal direction to this plane. The equilibrium equations are derived and they can be shown to generalise those for isotropic materials. Further, wave-like deformations on the outer-most surface of the oscillating carbon nanotubes are investigated. On neglecting any frictional effects and assuming that the inner surface atoms of the outer tube and those located on the outer surface of the inner tube dominate the van der Waals force, expressions for displacements in the r- and z-directions are obtained.The major contribution of this thesis is the use of conventional applied mathe- matical modelling techniques to formulate analytical expressions for nanostructures. Broadly three mechanical issues are studied, including (i) van der Waals interaction energy and oscillatory behaviour for nanostructures, (ii) geometry of combining two nanostructures and (iii) deformation of carbon nanotubes as transversely isotropic materials. However, many of the theoretical structures proposed here have yet to be confirmed either experimentally or by molecular dynamics simulations; and as such the work might be considered as a first step to settling some of the important physical principles in nanotechnology. In summary, the new elements of the thesis comprise:&#8226;	Analytical expressions to determine the equilibrium locations, force distributions and oscillatory behaviours for nested nanostructures,&#8226;	Simple least squares methods to connect two nanostructures,&#8226;	Elastic model for the deformations of double-walled carbon nanotubes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/51</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding social relevance: young people, wellbeing and regulated support</field><field name="creator">Laverty, Judith</field><field name="description">In this thesis I draw on data from semi-structured interviews with eleven young people living in economically disadvantaged circumstances in Sydney, Australia to explore how these young people make a life and negotiate the discourses that operate to support and regulate them. Drawing on Foucault&#8217;s (1991) discussion of &#8220;governmentality&#8221; I develop a new analytical matrix (the matrix of regulated citizenship) to map the relationships between neo-liberal notions of individual responsible citizenship, institutional discourses of support and young people&#8217;s self practices. Through this mapping I describe the regulatory impacts of neo-liberal and institutional discourses on young people&#8217;s lives and demonstrate how forms of compliance become normalised and/or are contested through people&#8217;s self making. The matrix reflects the operation and interconnections between neo-liberal and institutional discourses of governance. It provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding young people&#8217;s lives and priorities beyond discussion of transition and risk, while also making available a new analytical tool for use in youth research.Through my analysis I draw attention to the multiple ways that young people negotiate and construct notions of possibility and wellbeing within the context of ongoing structural constraint and increasing individualisation. In particular, I identify the critical interconnections for young people in the study between forms of self determination, social connection and finding &#8220;relevance&#8221; or a place where you feel you fit. It provides insights into how young people are represented and representing themselves within a neo-liberal society and the regulated context of support.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/128</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fiscal policy and private saving in Australia: Ricardian equivalence, twin deficits and broader policy inferences</field><field name="creator">Brittle, Shane Anthony</field><field name="description">Concern in the United States over fiscal and current account deficits during the 1980s led to arguments that these deficits were linked, or &#8220;twins&#8221;. The Reagan Administration conducted an expansionary fiscal policy by cutting taxes, which was not accommodated by monetary policy. This placed upward pressure on US interest rates &#8211; which subsequently boosted the US dollar. The exchange rate appreciation led to a fall in net exports and a rise in the US current account deficit. Under these circumstances, the current account appeared to mirror the fiscal position, leading to the popularisation of the twin deficits hypothesis.Similar concerns were also held in Australia. Following the depreciation of the Australian dollar after its float in December 1983, the remainder of the decade saw a widening of the current account deficit; while net foreign debt increased from around 6 per cent of GDP in June 1981 to 32 per cent five years later. This led to both political and community unease over the large current account and rising stock of net foreign debt. Policymakers subsequently focused on fiscal consolidation as a means of reducing the current account deficit &#8211; leading to the establishment of policies such as the trilogy commitments in the Commonwealth&#8217;s 1985-86 Budget.An antonym to the twin deficit argument is provided by Ricardian equivalence, which asserts that deficits merely postpone taxes, and through the actions of altruistically motivated individuals, budget deficits have no real affects on the economy &#8211; including the current account. Australian academics during the late 1980s and early 1990s such as Makin (1988), Pitchford (1989) and Corden (1991) also challenged the notion that Australia&#8217;s level of net foreign debt and the current account were concerns for fiscal policy. They argued that private sector investment and saving decisions were made by optimising private individuals and organisations, with any benefits or costs of these decisions being a matter for these private agents.Research interest in fiscal policy waned over the 1990s, and for the most part of the 2000s, as monetary policy assumed the role of stabilising short-term fluctuations in prices and output in most advanced economies. Fiscal policy was left to focus upon the medium-term sustainability of government balance sheets, which for Australia was reflected in the introduction of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act by the Howard Government, and the adoption of its medium-term fiscal strategy.More recently, the sharp economic downturn associated with the global financial and economic crises of 2008 and 2009 has seen fiscal stimulus packages enacted in many countries, and a renewed interest in activist fiscal policy.  With little empirical knowledge on the efficacy of fiscal policy in modern economies, recent discretionary fiscal policies have been enacted without a thorough understanding of the potency of these policy actions &#8211; particularly given the marked structural changes in many developed economies over the past two decades (such as the increased integration of global product and financial markets).The purpose of this thesis is to provide an assessment of the potential efficacy of fiscal policy in Australia as a countercyclical policy tool. More specifically, the thesis considers whether private saving behaves in a manner that is consistent with Ricardian equivalence, thus mitigating the effects of fiscal policy, or conversely, if fiscal policy has some ability to influence real economic activity &#8211; leading to effects consistent with the twin deficits hypothesis.This thesis seeks to make an original contribution to the literature by first considering a large sample, both in the number of observations (188), and across almost 50 years from 1959-2006. Second, a great deal of attention is given to structural change in the Australian economy over this time &#8211; something which previous empirical literature (particularly for Australia) has paid little attention to.  Econometric techniques that consider the possibility of two structural breaks in each time series will be utilised. Incorporating these structural breaks into a cointegration analysis will allow for the estimation of such a large sample. Further, the work conducted here provides a more up-to-date analysis of the efficacy of fiscal policy in Australia. As noted by Kennedy (et al: 2004), there is little empirical evidence on the efficacy of fiscal policy in Australia, or estimates of fiscal multipliers.The analytical model employed in this thesis considers the extent to which private saving responds to changes in the total general government (Commonwealth, state and local) fiscal stance. While this framework lends itself towards explaining Ricardian equivalence effects, it can also be considered as a broad measure of the impact of fiscal policy on short- and long-run aggregate demand. The model is estimated using the autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL) to cointegration, which provides both short- and long-run coefficient estimates, but also provides the flexibility to accommodate the introduction of coefficients for structural breaks.As mentioned above, it is likely that the Australian economy has been subject to a substantial amount of structural change over the past 50 years. From the 1950s through to the early 1980s, the economy was heavily regulated, with markets subject to price controls and tariff protection, a fixed exchange rate, and government controls on bank deposits, interest rates and credit. The 1980s saw a period of rapid reform, with the floating of the dollar, removal of restrictions on credit creation, interest rates, foreign capital inflows and other broader reforms around market pricing and removal (or lowering) of tariffs and subsidies. Not accounting for these changes could lead to spurious results in the econometric analysis. While traditional Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests are conducted, the more advanced Lee and Strazicich one and two-break unit root tests are also used &#8211; which will also yield information regarding the timing of structural breaks in the Australian economy.Results indicate that while there is not a full Ricardian response to changes in the fiscal stance, there is some partial offsetting behaviour. The results imply that fiscal policy does elicit some impact on the real economy which will be partly offset by increased private saving or other crowding out effects. Lower short-run private saving offsets revealed through the error correction mechanisms indicate that nominal and real frictions and/or rigidities prevent some proportion of any offsetting savings behaviour occurring more quickly. Additionally, some households may also be subject to short-run liquidity constraints. However, nominal and real rigidities appear to have lessened as the Australian economy has been subject to significant economic reform.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3032</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade, growth, and the environment nexus: the experience of China, 1990-2007</field><field name="creator">Liu, Ying</field><field name="description">The market-oriented economic reforms that started in 1978 have greatly transformed the Chinese economy. China&#8217;s GDP has increased tenfold since 1978 while the per capita income has grown at an average annual rate of more than 8% over the last three decades, drastically reducing poverty. China&#8217;s foreign trade has grown faster than its GDP for the past 25 years (Chen and Li, 2000). Although industrial emissions increased in absolute terms that has been a noticeable reduction in per capita emissions especially after 1997.The major objective of this thesis is to study the nexus of trade, economic growth, and the environment in China during the period from 1990 to 2007. There are two interrelated hypotheses to be tested for this purpose: (1) The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis and (2) Trade liberalisation in China had a short term negative effect on the environment and a long term positive effect based on the assumption that externality can be internalised and that an EKC exists in China.Both quadratic and cubic EKC models were used to capture the relationship between the per capita of income and the per capita of four industrial pollution emissions (SO2, smoke, dust, and COD). Due to an unbalanced development among the regions, this study grouped the whole country into three regions to examine the impact of a geographic location. The fixed effect and panel data were used. The results showed that an inverted-U shaped relationship as hypothesised by the EKC quadratic model in the case of SO2 exists, with a turning point at per capita GDP of 6,376 yuan, while  N-shaped curves were found for smoke, dust and COD in different regions. The results also showed that the more developed coastal region appears to have a turning point at a higher income level than the less developed central and western regions.To study the impact of trade liberalisation on the environment, this study adopted a modified version of Dean&#8217;s (2002) simultaneous model using a disaggregated sample based on above and below the turning point of the EKC. The Two-Stage Least Squares method was used. The results from the overall sample showed that the scale effects outweighed the technique effects for air pollutant (SO2) and water pollutant (COD), which is evidence for the pollution haven hypothesis. The split sample provided limited support for the EKC hypothesis where a rising level of income at the provincial level via an increased level of international trade was associated with falling emissions from the technique effect, so that rising income among the provinces tended to show a superior performance.In order to harmonise development stricter environmental regulations must be associated with growing incomes because they may provide the motivation for better production techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3040</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of potential dual-action antibacterial agents</field><field name="creator">Ambrus, Joseph Imre</field><field name="description">With the ever-present threat of bacteria becoming resistant to all known antibacterial drugs comes a pressing need to develop new antibacterial agents which circumvent this resistance. One of the major mechanisms of resistance that bacteria employ to compromise the activity of antibacterials is through efflux pumps. These pumps, such as the NorA pump in Staphylococcus aureus, have the ability to extrude a wide range of structurally dissimilar antibiotics, hence conferring multidrug resistance to the bacteria. To date, there have been no therapeutically useful inhibitors of efflux pumps developed and thus there is great scope to develop agents which address this clinically relevant problem.This dissertation focused on two main strands of research. The first addressed the need for new inhibitors of bacterial efflux pumps. A structure-activity based approach to drug design was utilised, centering on the lead NorA inhibitor 2-phenyl-5-nitro-1H-indole. These synthetic efforts led to the discovery of 2-phenyl-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile (70) as a potential new inhibitor of the NorA pump, with an MIC of 3.6 mM (in the presence of the antibacterial berberine at 100 mg/mL; 269.0 mM) against the NorA wild-type strain of S. aureus. A serendipitous discovery of a novel antibacterial agent, the alcohol (2-phenyl-1H-indol-5-yl)-methanol (75), was made during these studies. This alcohol was found to have a direct antibacterial MIC of 13.4 mM against a NorA pump knockout strain of S. aureus and 28.0 mM against the NorA wild-type and overexpressing strains of S. aureus. This new compound offers a simple, heterocyclic lead compound for future development as an antibacterial agent. The inter-related second strand of research took advantage of dual action-based approaches to drug design. Several dual action drugs were synthesised which combined an efflux pump-sensitive antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) and efflux pump inhibitor analogue. Of these compounds, 90, 91 and 96 showed promising antibacterial activities with MIC&#8217;s of 0.6, 3.9 and 1.5 mM respectively against all three strains of S. aureus (NorA knockout, NorA wild-type and NorA overexpressing). This data confirmed that these dual action drugs were evading this particular resistance mechanism and helped to validate this principle of dual action drug design.A novel dual action prodrug was also designed and a protected version synthesised. This prodrug contained the antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) linked to an efflux pump inhibitor analogue through a &#946;-lactam nucleus, which was planned to act as a bacterially-specific triggering mechanism. Future work will involve the complete synthesis and testing of this prodrug 122 to assess its antibacterial activity and to determine if it is acting as a dual action prodrug.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/67</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silence speaks volumes - the deaf experience of mental health, culture and communication</field><field name="creator">Rodrigues, Otilia</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore the world of deafness and to identify the major issues that beset deaf people. The experience of deaf people is largely unknown by the hearing world, partly because of the unimaginable nature of the reality of deafness (unlike blindness which, to some extent at least, can be easily simulated, though blindness from birth cannot), partly because deafness is not immediately visible and partly because the communication issues are so complex. The thesis begins with an historical view of deafness to provide a rationale for the way in which deaf people are understood and treated today and then moves on to identify the most serious and far-reaching issues that affect the lives of this population. Health and mental health, language, education, communication and cultural issues are explored in depth and their importance compared. Cultural issues emerge as a special complexity as Deaf* communities have strong difficulties in being recognised as a culture as opposed to a disabled minority. To overcome this, a paradigm shift is needed whereby Deaf people can be viewed as both a separate culture and a normal population within a wellness model. A theoretical framework, Personal Construct Theory, is proposed as a theoretical approach that will validate Deaf experience and also provide an explanation of the hearing world&#8217;s interpretation of Deafness. It is proposed that this framework provides both a bridge for more effective communication and useful clinical perspectives, thereby providing the context for the paradigm shift that is needed. Three studies are presented. Study 1 establishes the extent of the problems associated with diagnosis of health and mental health problems; Study 2 presents an initial strategy to combat diagnostic issues by translating a widely used diagnostic mental xiv health test into Auslan (Australian Sign Language) using a CD-ROM format and trialling the test with a pilot group; Study 3 presents an exploration of the ways in which Deaf and hearing people interpret themselves and one another using the Personal Construct Theory framework. The thesis concludes with a discussion of the ways in which this research contributes to the paradigm shift that will change the perception of deafness and the social conditions related to this population. *&#8221;D&#8221; Deaf is used to refer to the culture of deaf people; &#8220;d&#8221; deaf is used to refer to the physiological (audiological) condition of deafness.

Successful management depends on appropriate monitoring of the health and extent of the seagrass meadows. This field-based spectral reflectance study generated baseline data that optimises the mapping of seagrass meadows, and has laid the groundwork for the monitoring of the physiological condition of meadows by hyperspectral remote sensing.A comprehensive spectral library of the three common seagrass species  nominating meadows in south eastern Australia (Zostera capricorni, Posidonia australis and Halophila ovalis) was produced by field spectrometry in order to characterise the spectral response and the variability inherent in the reflectance of these seagrasses growing in their natural environment across different estuaries, habitats, seasons and years. There was small but significant spatial and temporal variability in the spectral reflectance recorded for each seagrass species, and in addition, the level of epibiont fouling of the seagrass leaves also induced significant intraspecific spectral differences. Despite this within-species variability, the seagrasses Z. capricorni, P. australis and H. ovalis were shown to be spectrally distinct across wide regions of the visible wavelengths, notably in those wavelength regions least affected by attenuation in an estuarine water column. Differences in the spectral signatures of the three seagrass species could mainly be attributed to differences in leaf morphology, although photosynthetic and accessory pigment concentrations, determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophotometry, did play an important role in determining reflectance. Within-species differences in seagrass leaf reflectance were linked to differences in leaf pigment composition, predominantly chlorophyll content, but structural changes in the internal anatomy of the leaves and differences in epibiont fouling were also implicated. Piece-wise multiplicative scatter correction (PMSC) was found to be a useful tool for the compilation of spectral libraries since it removes external spectral variation associated with sample illumination and viewing geometry from the reflectance signatures, while highlighting the spectral reflectance variability inherent in the plants themselves.Laboratory spectrometry was used to characterise the spectral changes that occurred in Z. capricorni leaves as the health of this seagrass declined in response to conditions of low and high light stress in laboratory experiments. Zostera capricorni was able to photoacclimate and chromatically acclimate to changes in irradiance over the short term (within days). Low light treated Z. capricorni were subjected to irradiance levels below their compensation point and within one to three months these samples were dead or had lost most of their biomass. Photosynthetic rate, measured by pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluoro metry, was reduced and the efficiency of light use maximised in light-deprived Z. capricorni compared with control plants. Low light stress ed leaves displayed lower chlorophyll a:b, zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin concentrations (measured by HPLC) than control plants within two weeks of exposure, but over the longer term showed a general increase in photosynthetic pigment concentration to maximise light harvesting. Orange shoulder (far-green to near&#8211;red) reflectance decreased significantly in response to shade treatment in concert with these pigment changes, however, significant increases in the green peak and NIR reflectance of low light stressed Z. capricorni were considered to represent changes in leaf internal structure rather than pigment content. Exposure to high irradiance decreased the efficiency of photosynthetic energy conversion in Z. capricorni leaves compared to samples grown at moderate light levels but increased photosynthetic rate. High light treatment significantly increased the concentration of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids (VAZ, i.e. violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeoxanthin) relative to other Z. capricorni leaf pigments and increased the proportion of VAZ pool occurring in the de-epoxidised state compared to controls. Hence, Z. capricorni displayed light-dependent downregulation of photosynthesis in response to high light stress and did not suffer photooxidative damage or reductions in growth or biomass during high light experiments. High light treated seagrass leaves displayed significantly lower green and far-red reflectance and significantly higher orange shoulder reflectance concurrent with these pigment changes and probable changes in leaf structure. In addition, a blue shift of the red edge and a red shift of the green edge were detected in the spectral reflectance of high light stressed seagrass leaves. The anthocyanin content of Z. capricorni leaves was not affected by ambient irradiance levels in these laboratory experiments.Significant linear relationships were observed for Z. capricorni in the concentration of chlorophyll a:b, VAZ:total carotenoids, VAZ:total chlorophyll, and A+Z:VAZ concentrations, and in spectral reflectance at wavelengths 550, 630 and 685 nm, as a function of average daily irradiance measured in the laboratory and in the field. These pigment-based indicators of light stress in Z. capricorni were significantly correlated with a number of hyperspectral reflectance indices and derivative indices, however correlation coefficients were typically low (r &lt; 0.66). The blue-green, blue-orange index [BGBO = (R495/R550) - (R495/R635)] developed in this thesis displayed significant linear relationships with chlorophyll a:b, VAZ:total carotenoids and VAZ:total chlorophyll content and showed the best potential as a remote sensing index for monitoring light stress in seagrass meadows. For an independent data set consisting of field-measured spectral reflectance for three seagrass species, measured chlorophyll a:b content explained 48% of the variation in chlorophyll a:b predicted by the  bluegreen, blue-orange index.Estuary managers should look toward the future by establishing high spectral and spatial resolution seagrass mapping and monitoring campaigns. This study has produced the first spectral library of aquatic plant species to take into account the range of spectral variability expected for the species under natural conditions. In addition, the research comprehensively combined ecophysiology and biochemical analysis with hyperspectral data to establish the characteristic spectral reflectance changes occurring in Z. capricorni in response to light stress. The results provide a sound basis for future mapping and monitoring of seagrass species in Australia. Furthermore, this research has laid the groundwork for the early detection of physiological stress in seagrass meadows, including development of a new plant stress index applicable to vegetation in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/472</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Construction of evaluative meanings in the IELTS writing: an intersubjective and intertextual perspective</field><field name="creator">Nakamura, Aki</field><field name="description">The interpersonal dimension of language use has attracted growing interest in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) for its important role in representing the writer&#8217;s evaluative position in a text and in constructing successful interpersonal relationship between the writer and the reader.  The present study explores the construction of evaluative meanings in English for second/foreign language (ESL/EFL) writing under exam conditions &#8211; still an under-explored area in EAP research.  This study analyses short argumentative essays written in response to Task 2 of the Academic Writing Module of the International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS) as a high-stakes gatekeeping genre by drawing on Appraisal theory and Genre theory developed within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) as well as the theory of intertextuality.  In so doing, it focuses on the linguistic and rhetorical resources deployed by IELTS writers to construct the intersubjective relationship between the writer and the reader and the intertextual relationship between the task prompt and the exam script.  The findings of the research demonstrate that there are differences in linguistic choices of evaluative resources depending on grades awarded.  Specifically, the study provides important insights into the distinguishing features of successful and less successful IELTS texts in terms of the degree of the writer&#8217;s dialogical or subjective engagement with the reader as well as the degree of intertextual density between the examination response and the task prompt as construed in the choice of what is evaluated (i.e. appraised).  The results suggest that the evaluative patterns which can be identified through the different &#8216;voices&#8217; that the IELTS writer projects in the IELTS task provide insights into what is valued in more successful IELTS writing.The study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the interpersonal expectations which are &#8216;hidden&#8217; or implicit in the current IELTS assessment criteria in the public domain. The tentative framework on intertextuality put forward in the study extends the current description of engagement resources captured in the existing Appraisal theory.

Compared to other metallic superconductors like NbTi (Tc = 9 K) and Nb3Sn (Tc = 18 K), it has the advantage of a higher critical temperature (Tc = 39 K), which enables its application at the temperature of 20 K and, hence, significantly reduces the cost of the cooling system. This, together with the abundance of the magnesium and boron raw materials, as well as the relatively simple fabrication of MgB2 wires and tapes, has motivated the active investigation and study of this superconductor by many research groups all over the world. As a result, a significant breakthrough for application of MgB2 conductors at high fields has been made with introduction of carbon into the crystal lattice of MgB2 via chemical doping. The main focus of this work was on the study of the microstructural and superconducting properties of MgB2-xCx superconductors and establishing correlations between them. To obtain MgB2-x Cx compounds with different characteristics, various C-based doping materials and processing parameters were employed. The systematic study of the microstructural and superconducting properties of MgB2-x Cx samples conducted in this work allowed us: (i) to predict suitable dopants for MgB2; (ii) to improve chemical doping by carbon; (iii) to identify the relevant negative microstructural factors and estimate their effects on limitation of the current-carrying ability in MgB2-xCx samples. The results described in this work can be used as a guide for the achievement of the characteristics required for practical applications of MgB2 superconductors. Investigation of the properties of MgB2-xCx superconductors as a function of the processing parameters showed that the doping level, sintering temperature, and cooling time control the density of pinning centers in MgB2-xCx, and affect the connectivity of grains and transparency of grain boundaries to current flow. Analysis of the pinning mechanism in the samples studied has led to establishing that the dominant pinning is on grain boundaries in the pure MgB2 samples, and on grain boundaries and crystal lattice defects in the MgB2-xCx samples. To demonstrate the effect of the pinning environment on the current-carrying ability in MgB2-xCx superconductors, a comparative study of the microstructural and superconducting properties for pure, nano SiC-, and C-doped MgB2 wires was carried out. In both SiC- and C-doped samples carbon substitution into the MgB2 crystal lattice results in the enhancement of the upper critical field, Bc2. However, it was revealed that the presence of SiC dopant allowed carbon substitution and MgB2 formation to take place simultaneously at low temperatures. Therefore, the microstructure of this SiC-doped sample assures maximal density of pinning centers (large number of grain boundaries, i.e. small grain sizes, and crystal lattice defects) and enhances pinning. These factors (higher Bc2 value and stronger pinning) are responsible for the superior enhancement in critical current density at relatively high fields in the SiC-doped sample. In contrast, for C-doping, higher processing temperatures are required for generation of a dense network of crystal lattice defects. In this case, the microstructure consists of larger grains, and the pinning on smaller number of grain boundaries becomes weaker, reducing the total pinning force and critical current density. An important outcome of this study was the establishment of the dual reaction model (simultaneous formation of MgB2 compound and C substitution into the lattice), which enables us to predict desirable dopants for enhancing the properties of MgB2. These should be C-based compounds which decompose, producing highly reactive C at temperatures below the temperature of MgB2 formation. Ideally, dopants should be homogeneously distributed within host the Mg and B powders and not contaminate grain boundaries in formed MgB2. The liquid mixing approach, a new advanced and at the same time simplified approach to chemical doping of MgB2 superconductor with carbon, was found to partially fulfill these requirements. Carbohydrates (sugar and malic acid) and polycarbosilane (a polymer analog to nano SiC-doping) were employed as doping materials. Liquid mixing has been shown to coat each individual nano sized boron powder particle with a nano-layer of amorphous carbon. Fresh unpassivated carbon extracted from carbohydrates or polycarbosilane easily incorporates itself into the MgB2 crystal lattice. This enhanced incorporation promoted by the maximal reaction surface assured by coating generates microstructure with a dense network of pinning sites and results in significant improvement of the superconducting properties in MgB2-xCx material. The results observed suggest that sugar as a dopant exhibits a stronger potential for practical application of MgB2 superconductor in the high field region than nano carbon doping. Similarly, stronger enhancement of superconducting properties was observed in polycarbosilane-doped MgB2 compared to nano SiC doping. The latter was ascribed to the formation of a microstructure with Mg2Si impurity phases mainly distributed within superconducting MgB2 grains. In this case, transparency of grain boundaries was likely improved, which resulted in the observed enhancement of critical current density over the entire field range. Systematic analysis of the microstructures and superconducting properties of sugar-, malic acid-, and polycarbosilane-doped MgB2 samples demonstrated that the critical current density was also significantly affected by the microstructural properties in the low field region. The results observed led to the development of a model, which allowed us to estimate the level of critical current density (Jc) limitation due to the microstructural features of pure and C-doped MgB2 samples. This model is based on the identification of individual contributions by various defects to critical current density limitation. These defects in the MgB2 microstructure include porosity and non-superconducting phase inclusions (so-called &#8220;geometrical&#8221; defects), as well as the connectivity and transparency of grain boundaries. The results observed showed that a higher level of &#8220;geometrical&#8221; defects results in stronger limitation of critical current flow through the sample and lower measured Jc values. The elimination of the &#8220;geometrical&#8221; defects would result in critical current densities that are a factor of 1.5 - 2 higher than currently measured values. The role of grain boundaries connectivity was found to be even more dramatic. For samples with fully connected grains, the estimated critical current densities were about one order of magnitude higher than the measured values. Moreover, the results of analysis showed that the low field Jc values are mainly determined by the connectivity and transparency of grain boundaries, while in field Jc(Ba) performance is affected by these defects in the microstructure to a lesser extent, and its behaviour is mainly determined by the pinning environment in the samples. It also was observed that while a denser pinning network favors in field Jc(Ba) behaviour, this results in reduction of grain boundary transparency and more pronounced critical current density limitation in the low field region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/11</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological correlates of interference control in the Eriksen task</field><field name="creator">Broyd, Samantha J</field><field name="description">This thesis examined conflict monitoring in the Eriksen task in which participants must respond to a centrally positioned target arrow and ignore simultaneously presented distractors that flank the target.  Distractors were either associated with a response congruent to the target, in conflict with the target, or, in a neutral condition, not associated with a response, instead producing only perceptual interference. This thesis extended on previous Eriksen research by systematically investigating the effect of varying the level of response conflict and task difficulty on stimulus processing in six studies and clarifying the functional role of ERP components elicited in the Eriksen task.  Specifically, this was achieved by (a) varying the number of flanking distractors and, (b) the level of response conflict by using different permutations of incongruent distractors, (c) reducing target stimulus perceptibility through degradation, (d) utilising both valid and invalid information to increase response preparation and make conflict monitoring more difficult, and (e) providing feedback in a speeded version of the task. In all six studies, two N2 components were clearly delineated &#8211; the first of which was increased to stimuli requiring enhanced feature detection processes (N2a), while the second N2 component (N2b) was consistently observed to increase following the detection of response conflict.  The P3 component, rarely considered in the Eriksen paradigm, was reduced at parietal sites and increased in latency as the discriminability of the target amongst the distractors became more difficult.  The results suggest that the P3 component may reflect stimulus evaluation processes and equivocation related to the ease of target identification and concurrent response selection processes imperative for accurate task performance.  This thesis also utilised digital filtering to clarify time-domain ERP results in terms of the relative contributions of activity in the alpha, theta and delta frequency ranges.  Event-related theta oscillations contributed significantly to the morphology of the two N2 components reflecting allocation of focused attentional resources following the detection of perceptual (theta N2a) or response conflict (theta N2b).  Activity in both theta and delta frequency ranges was robustly observed to contribute to the P3 component.  An increased theta response at frontal sites was observed along with increases in task difficulty likely indexing the activation of anterior attentional resources. The results also suggest that the parietal delta P3 component reflects a refined form of equivocation, sensitive to the perceptibility of the target, and concomitant with the relative ease of accurate response selection. This thesis has clarified successful conflict monitoring and task performance in the Eriksen task, and the relationship with stimulus-locked ERP components in the time and frequency domains. The results suggest that the second frontally maximal N2 component reflects successful conflict monitoring, while the P3 component most probably reflects equivocation arising from difficult target identification and accurate response selection, rather than response conflict per se.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/363</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Almaviva: a contemporary adaptation of Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Rachel</field><field name="description">Almaviva: A Contemporary Adaptation of Mozart&#8217;s Le Nozze di FigaroAlmaviva is a creative project, consisting of the text and score for a musical based on Mozart&#8217;s opera Le Nozze di Figaro as well as a supporting essay on the nature of adaptation. The musical is based on a heavily reduced version of the Figaro score. Half the opera score is cut, although the &#8220;greatest hits&#8221; remain, and nearly all the recitative is replaced with dialogue.The Almaviva text is entirely original. The new text sets the Figaro story in a contemporary work-place and has an informal, vernacular quality. It is designed for performance by six singers accompanied by a piano. The piece was first workshopped by students at the University of Wollongong in 2005, performing in a variety of vocal styles and with a very sparse set. Almaviva is designed for flexibility and for touring.The musical does not pre-suppose any prior exposure to opera or to the Figaro story. It aims for accessibility, and seeks to avoid operatic convention wherever possible. Almaviva is an experiment which seeks to radically transform the source while preserving some of its beauty. Almaviva is not a satire, but a free-standing work which uses the opera for scaffolding.This scaffolding includes the original score and Italian libretto, as well as the French play by Beaumarchais upon which the libretto is based. Almaviva is a third generation adaptation. The accompanying essay (Introduction) considers various aspects of adaptation, including authorship, translation, music setting and crossing genres. Central to this investigation are different ideas about fidelity to the source being adapted. For example, although Almaviva is a very free adaptation it seeks to recognise and preserve musical effect.The essay also considers the connection between adaptation and originality. Originality seems an odd quality in an adaptation, yet adaptations are frequently original, because immersion in a deeply creative work encourages creativity. Successful adaptation releases energy in two ways: For new audiences the adaptation works like any effective work of art, and the energy is derived from the successful expression of ideas. For audiences aware of the original work there is additional energy released by the re-contextualising of the familiar. The essay deliberately avoids assessing the effectiveness of Almaviva, but describes some of the major adaptations made to the Figaro story in all its incarnations paying particular attention to Almaviva.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/735</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weighing the risks: individualisation, trust and risk in three lead contaminated communites in Australia</field><field name="creator">Condon-Paoloni, Deanne</field><field name="description">This thesis explores residents&#8217; accounts of their experience of dealing with living in an environment that has been designated as potentially hazardous because of lead contamination, and which potentially placed them, but especially their children, in the category &#8216;at risk&#8217;. This qualitative study investigated how people come to decisions about health risks in the environment and how they evaluate these within a community and family context. The study was carried out in three Australian communities identified as contaminated by lead, Port Pirie, Broken Hill and Port Kembla, that have varying degrees of lead contamination and different levels of programs dealing with lead abatement, providing the opportunity for a comparative analysis of responses to risk in relation to exposure and abatement.Lead in the environment is potentially an emotive issue, since its effects are most significant in a vulnerable group, preschool aged children. There also has been significant scientific and policy debate about what constitutes a hazardous level of lead in blood, and there has been a constant downward revision of &#8216;safe&#8217; blood lead levels. Lead contamination therefore provides an excellent case study to explore community responses to expert risk assessment.The study used the &#8216;risk society&#8217; macro-theory of Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens, especially their development of the concepts of risk, reflexivity, individualization and trust, as a framework for understanding residents&#8217; responses at the micro-level in the community.Findings showed that risk has become normalised and globalised, so that risk from lead is just one risk among many that participants in the study saw as routine in their everyday lives. The study also showed the importance of the individualisation of many aspects of contemporary life. Participants, as parents, saw themselves as individually responsible for life planning, for managing their children&#8217;s paths through life until they were old enough to take on the role, and health planning was one part of this, a project in which all members of society were engaged. This individualisation of all aspects of life and health, resulted in a redefinition of environmental risk as a lifestyle risk that moved responsibility for its management away from government and health agencies onto the individual.One part of the normalisation and globalisation of risk was related to the dependence on abstract expert systems, such as the health system or agencies involved in environmental monitoring. The thesis shows the importance of trust in relation to risk, in the relationship between the institutions responsible for promoting the health of the population, and especially the importance of the mechanisms by which trust is established and maintained. Finally, it is argued that risk was not so much acceptable as weighed in the balance, so that residents balanced individualised management of risk against living in the community, social relations, employment and other aspects of social life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/772</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing synergetic momentum: a grounded theory of the management of public-private partnerships</field><field name="creator">Noble, Gary Ian</field><field name="description">This study uses an orthodox grounded theory methodology to discover the main professional concerns of managers responsible for the establishment and maintenance of public-private partnerships (PPPs) involving local governments and private sector firms. In addition, this study explains the social processes that these managers use to resolve these concerns over the life of a PPP project. Orthodox grounded theory is an inductive research methodology capable of theory building. It was selected for use for several reasons. These included its ability to provide an explanation of the variation in the patterns of behaviour of respondents as they establish and manage a PPP project. Data was collected from ten PPP projects in both Australia and the UK through interviews with forty three respondents, non-participant observation and archival records. Data was analysed using the constant comparative method and involved the use of theoretical memos and theoretical sampling procedures. The main professional concern of respondents over the managerial life of a PPP project involves the need to maintain the forward momentum of a project whilst also having to constantly resolve managerial issues through a process of seeking the cooperation of managers from the partner organisation. Key managers continuously resolve this concern through the social process of &#8216;managing synergetic momentum&#8217; (MSM). The grounded theory of MSM suggests that in circumstances where there exists strong emotional bonds, mutual trust and respect, key managers are likely to make a conscious decision to manage a PPP project through largely informal methods that often rely on the use of psychological contracts between individuals. In contrast, when there are low levels of emotional bonding between key managers, the style of management chosen by managers is often formal and bureaucratic in nature. This management style often involves the use of committee and other formal decision making processes to resolve managerial issues. An informal management style can be an effective means to address the issues of maintaining forward momentum of a PPP and managing in a cooperative manner with other key managers. This study contributes to the extant literature in several ways. Firstly, it provides insights into, and an explanation of, the actions of key managers in the process of managing PPP projects. It provides another dimension in the PPP literature to the micromanagement of PPPs. Secondly, it provides conceptual support to many of the themes contained in the cooperative inter-organisational relationship (CIOR) literature by contextualising the dynamics of the social processes that underlie these themes. The grounded theory of MSM is also significant in that it provides practitioners in the substantive area of inquiry with a number of recommendations designed to assist in their control over the management of a PPP project. In addition, the grounded theory of MSM identifies a number of avenues for future research that may add further to our understanding of the management of PPPs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/310</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AC loss in Ag/Bi-2223 tapes in AC field</field><field name="creator">Farhoudi, Mohammad Mehdi</field><field name="description">Bi-2223/Ag tapes are currently the only HTS that can be classified as &#8220;conductor&#8221;; i.e. long lengths of the tapes can be purchased and used in practical applications. They have started their use primarily in applications with alternating currents (AC), such as transformers, high current/low voltage cables, motors and generators.The energy losses in practical superconductors are negligibly small under suitable working conditions. However, Bi-2223/Ag tapes are composite conductors, consisting of superconducting filaments in a silver matrix. Composite conductors are associated with additional losses when the tape is used in AC applications, commonly referred to AC coupling loss.The susceptibility of different tapes to the coupling losses is usually described by effective transverse resistivity, P&#8869;. P &#8869;differs from resistivity of the silver matrix, and it is a convenient way to describe the susceptibility of a tape to the AC loss. Coupling currents between the filaments flow in a complicated pattern because of the complex geometry of the tapes. The coupling current loss depends not only on the resistivity of the silver matrix, but also on the spatial distribution of the currents. Therefore, the overall shape of the tape, as well as the architecture of the superconducting filaments in the tape are important factors defining the coupling losses. The geometrical factor needs to be known for determination of P &#8869;and is for tapes usually taken simply as the aspect ratio of the tapes, a/b, where a is the thickness and b is the width of the tape. The Abstract proposed study is aimed at determining the effective transverse resistivity of 8 filamentary untwisted Bi-2223/Ag tapes, fabricated by the PIT method and heat treated at 837oC. This takes into account the filament configuration, tape thickness and width as well. Three thicknesses of 0.18mm, 0.24mm and 0.33mm tape were studied. Ic, X-ray diffraction, and optical microscopy measurements were performed in order to characterise the tape. The Bi2223/Bi2212 phase ratio in the composite is XBi2223=~87%, and there is no bridging between the filament and no discontinuities. The Ic values for the thicknesses are: Ic(0.18mm)=11.2A, Ic(0.24mm)=17.85A, Ic(0.33mm)=13.8A. The Ic vs. thickness values demonstrate an optimum thickness for Ic.Measurements of the frequency dependence of the AC loss makes it possible to obtain the value of  P &#8869;&#61472;for each thickness-length of tape. This measurement was performed using an induction method, with the excitation field applied parallel to the face of the tape.

To date, however, little if any of this research has looked at consumer reaction to such information communicated via the medium of advertising, despite the increasing use of such corporate societal advertising appeals. While scepticism is a common cognitive response toward advertising, how scepticism toward non-economic corporate image claims might be promoted or inhibited through message elements has not been the focus of research attention. This thesis seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating the impact of two diagnostic message elements on scepticism toward specific CSR claims.This study examines whether consumer scepticism toward the advertising of CSR claims can be influenced by altering the diagnosticity of social topic information and CSR commitment message dimensions. Two key research questions are addressed: does the provision of more social topic information encourage consumers toward less CSR advertising claim scepticism?, and does more specific information about a firm&#8217;s CSR commitment, expressing both its history and actual achievements, and their impacts, inhibit CSR advertising claim scepticism?In order to investigate these two research questions, an experimental approach was used to allow the manipulation of message elements and the testing of cause and effect. Data received via an online panel of a cross-section of 417 Australian consumers were analysed, and the hypotheses specified in study were tested using analysis of variance and covariance techniques.Results from this research suggest that increased information about the social topic related to the domain of the firm&#8217;s CSR initiatives does not significantly influence the level of scepticism toward CSR advertising claims, but information specificity about the firm&#8217;s CSR commitment does. These results are impacted by the consumer&#8217;s level of scepticism toward advertising in general, attitude toward the notion of corporate social responsibility, and attitude toward the social topic. The findings of this thesis provide evidence that consumers have the ability to deal with larger cognitive loads, created by information about specific impacts of firms&#8217; CSR programs, and that such diagnostic information is useful in reducing scepticism responses to CSR messages. These responses are important, as they form the foundation of subsequent attitudinal and belief structures so critical for influencing consumer behaviour.The theoretical contributions of this study include: (1) situating the role of social topic information, considered a critical element of advertising campaigns in social marketing, in CSR advertising situations; (2) implicating an organisation&#8217;s CSR history and CSR and impacts as important diagnostic elements in CSR message claims; and (3) defending the ability of consumers to adequately discriminate between cognitively demanding informational inputs when evaluating CSR advertising claims. Given increasing demand from consumers to learn about firms&#8217; CSR efforts, and firms&#8217; increasing willingness to respond to these information demands with CSR-based advertising campaigns, this study also offers guidance for marketing communication managers charged with developing corporate image based on CSR-based brand claims. Limitations and directions for future research are also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3023</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insoluble oxide product formation and its effect on coke dissolution in liquid iron</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Michael Wallace</field><field name="description">A significant body of work exists around coke dissolution into liquid iron, however there are key aspects of this important reaction that are not well described. This study was focused on gaining the answers to the questions &#8220;How does the coke mineral matter behave during coke dissolution?&#8221; and &#8220;Can the effects of sulphur and oxide layer formation on the dissolution rate be separated and quantified?&#8221;. Issues that must be addressed if the understanding of the kinetics of this reaction is to be advanced and coke's use in the blast furnace further optimised.To this end, a detailed investigation was conducted examining the influence of coke mineral matter on coke (carbon) dissolution into liquid iron. This project was focused on the mineral matter layer that forms at the coke/iron interface and how the presence of this layer affects the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke into the liquid iron. A range of experimental techniques were used to identify and characterise the mineral layer as it formed at the coke/iron interface and to assess the layers influence on the carbon dissolution kinetics.Carbon dissolution experiments, utilising a carburiser cover technique, were carried out where carbon and sulphur transfer to an iron-carbon melt was measured over time at temperatures of 1450&#176;C, 1500&#176;C and 1550&#176;C. This technique allowed fundamental data on the dissolution rate constant to be calculated, and the effects of temperature, melt sulphur and different carbonaceous materials to be explored.Development of the mineral layer at the coke/iron interface as a function of both time and temperature was studied utilising a quenched carbon dissolution technique that was developed during the project. This technique had the additional benefit of allowing the composition of the melt to be determined for a larger range of elements than the dissolution experiments. The quenched carbon dissolution experiments complemented the carbon dissolution experiments and allowed direct comparisons between the dissolution behaviour measured in the dissolution experiments and the composition and morphology of the mineral layer observed in the quenched samples.The dissolution studies were further complemented by sessile drop measurements of the wetting behaviour of iron on the mineral phases that were identified in the mineral layer present at the coke/iron interface, thermodynamic modelling utilising the MTDATA software package and a conceptual model of the interfacial mineral layer.A mineral layer was observed to have formed at the coke/iron interface during coke dissolution into liquid iron at experimental temperatures ranging from 1450&#176;C to 1550&#176;C. The mineral layer was solid at these temperatures and persistent at the interface. The amount of mineral matter present in the mineral layer was observed to be increasing with increased reaction time. The composition and structure of the mineral layer changed with both experimental time and temperature. The composition of the mineral layer was principally composed of oxides of aluminium and calcium, present as various calcium aluminates and calcium sulphides. Initially the mineral layer was a loose agglomeration of particles of which a majority were alumina particles. As the dissolution reaction proceeded, the loose agglomeration of particles was replaced by an open acicular layer that was predominantly the calcium aluminate CaO.6Al2O3 (CA6). As the dissolution reaction continued further, the calcium aluminates became increasingly richer in calcium oxide, with the predominate phase present in the mineral layer progressing through the calcium aluminates phases CA6 to CaO.2Al2O3 (CA2) and onto CaO.Al2O3 (CA). The apparent calcium enrichment of the mineral layer was observed to occur more rapidly as the experimental temperature increased. Accompanying the compositional changes in the mineral layer, the morphology of the mineral layer was also observed to change. The mineral layer was formed as an initial loose agglomeration of alumina particles, changing to an open acicular structure consisting of CA6/CA2 before being converted to a dense layer as the dissolution reaction proceeded and the composition of the mineral layer changed to CA and calcium sulphide (CaS) appeared at the interface.It was found that the formation of the calcium sulphide layer was preceded by the formation of the calcium aluminate layer. Only after the calcium aluminate layer had experienced progressive calcium enrichment and the CA and CA2 phases had formed did the CaS phase appear at the iron interface. Thermodynamic analysis of the experimental results confirmed that the formation of the calcium enriched calcium aluminates, CA2 and CA, were a necessary requirement to stabilise the calcium sulphide layer for the coke composition studied.The kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were observed to be dependent on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer. This dependence was manifest as two stage behaviour in the first order mass transfer plots. The initial stage, characterised by rapid carbon dissolution, was observed while the mineral layer was developing or had the open acicular structure of the CA6/CA2 layer. The second stage was characterised by a significant reduction in the rate of carbon dissolution. The onset of the second stage was coincident with the change in the composition of the mineral layer from CA6/CA2 to CA2/CA and the associated densification of the mineral layer. In stating that the nature of the mineral layer affects the dissolution kinetics, a change in the reaction control mechanism is implied. This represents a change in the coke dissolution kinetics from simple mass transfer control to a mixed control regime where both mass transfer and the mineral (product) layer are active.In an attempt to overcome the problems associated with the heterogeneity of coke a coke analogue was developed. In the coke analogue the composition and dispersion of the carbonaceous and mineral matter (oxides) are controlled and the porosity is fixed. When single phase calcium aluminates were introduced into the coke analogues, calcium enrichment of the resulting calcium aluminate mineral layer was observed. The observed carbon dissolution kinetics were dependant on the structure of the interfacial calcium aluminate layer. Consistent with the coke dissolution studies, the calcium aluminate layer formed at the coke analogue iron interface during carbon dissolution was at least in part rate controlling the carbon dissolution reaction for the coke analogues studied.Utilising the sessile drop experimental technique the wettability with liquid ironcarbon-sulphur alloys of the predominate phases that were observed in the mineral layer were measured. It was observed that the contact angle decreased as the proportion of lime (CaO) in the calcium aluminate increased. Further it was observed that while the presence of sulphur in the melt increased the contact angle for the alumina and CA6 substrates, on the CA2 and CA substrates the contact angle was decreased. The improvement in the wetting of the CA2 and CA substrates with sulphur was attributed to the formation of CaS at the substrate/droplet interface.This study has produced new fundamental data on the growth and development of the mineral layer and the wettability of the predominate calcium aluminates observed in the mineral layer. These detailed studies have illuminated the changing nature of the layer in terms of both composition and morphology and found that the kinetics of carbon dissolution from the coke to the liquid iron were dependant on the structure of the interfacial mineral layer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3039</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building Babel: freeing multimedia processing and delivery from hard-coded formats</field><field name="creator">Thomas-Kerr, Joseph Alfred</field><field name="description">The amount of multimedia content available via the Internet, and the number of formats in which it is encoded, stored and delivered continues to grow rapidly. So too the number and diversity of the devices and software applications which produce, process and consume such content. This constantly changing landscape presents an increasing challenge to interoperability, since more and more software and hardware must be upgraded as new formats are developed. However, many of the operations performed on multimedia content are similar across coding formats. In recognising this, this thesis proposes several approaches to format-independent media processing, with an emphasis on content delivery. This considerably simplifies interoperability, since support for a new content format may be provided by disseminating a data file, rather than requiring application and device providers to extend and modify their software and hardware. A fundamental requirement for format-independence is the ability to describe the structure of any given format in a way that exposes how it may be fragmented for delivery or processing, and how other data important to the processing (for instance temporal or scalability parameters) can be extracted from the binary data. Several meta-syntax languages are evaluated that (to greater or lesser degree) perform this function. Of these, the most suitable for general use in format-independent processors is found to be MPEG-21&#8217;s Bitstream Syntax Description Language (BSDL). Its general suitability notwithstanding, BSDL exhibits several critical flaws when used to describe and process modern content formats. In response, this thesis proposes several new features for the language which significantly reduce processing complexity, and provide extensibility for complex data types. These features are implemented and validated using bitstreams of real-world length, which enable a linear response of approximately 10 times the speed of playback (on the particular test machine used), for videos up to one hour in duration. Digital media increasingly encompasses a wide range of metadata, as well as collections of related content (a DVD and it&#8217;s &#8220;special features&#8221;, for instance). Several recent standards address generic virtual containers for such rich content. While these standards&#8212;which include MPEG-21 and TVAnytime&#8212;provide numerous tools for interacting with rich media objects, they do not provide a framework for streaming or delivery of such data. This thesis presents the Bitstream Binding Language (BBL), a format-independent tool that describes how multimedia content and metadata may be bound into delivery formats. Using a BBL description, a generic processor can map rich content (an MPEG-21 Digital Item, for example) into a streaming or static delivery format. BBL provides a universal syntax for fragmentation and packetisation of both XML and binary data, and allows new content and metadata formats to be delivered without requiring the addition of new software to the delivery infrastructure. The BBL framework is validated and tested against a number of application scenarios including a format-independent streaming server, generic metadata syntax translation, virtual container assembly, and a format-independent hinter.Finally, it is observed that much of the semantic metadata that is generated to describe multimedia content could also be used to improve the decisions that must be made in order to transmit it effectively. Indeed, methods have been proposed for using specific semantic concepts in the delivery process. However, until now, no high-level system has been proposed that is able to take arbitrary semantic metadata, and utilise it in the multimedia delivery decision-making process. This thesis proposes such a system. It combines the aforementioned semantic concepts with other existing work in Rate-Distortion Optimisation for multimedia delivery, scalable content formats, and syntax description, and then develops a generalised framework to permit an arbitrary range of semantic metadata and optimisation techniques to be utilised. This objective is accomplished by utilising schema languages to describe the details of any given content or metadata, so that declarative mapping rules can be specified for translating from format-specific data points to format-independent concepts that are directly used by the framework. This translation can then be performed using software or hardware that knows nothing about the specific format it is processing.This thesis describes a particular embodiment of the semantic-aware multimedia delivery system which was implemented in order to verify its key assertions. It presents the results of subjective testing that was performed on several short news clips encoded using H.264/SVC scalable video coding, and Scalable-To-Lossless (SLS) au dio coding. Each clip was adapted to four target bitrates, using both of two methods: (a) using the semantic-aware system to devote a greater proportion of the available bandwidth to that part of the content (audio or video) that was conveying more of the semantics at any given time; and (b) at a constant bit-rate with the same average rate as clip (a). Test participants were shown each pair of clips (a and b) in a random order and were asked to evaluate which was more successful at conveying the meaning of the story. The result of this subjective testing was a 72% preference for those clips which had been adapted so as to devote more bandwidth to the semantically-important parts of the content.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computational Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3054</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and numerical studies for evaluating dynamic behaviour of prestressed concrete sleepers subject to severe impact loading</field><field name="creator">Kaewunruen, Sakdirat</field><field name="description">Rail operators are consistently demanding higher axle loads to compete effectively with other modes of transport, particularly for heavy haul freight of minerals. However, high axle loads can only be achieved by ensuring that the existing rail infrastructure can cope with the greater static and dynamic loads associated with the wheel-rail interactions. Premature cracking of prestressed concrete sleepers is often the result of high-intensity dynamic loading caused by wheel or rail irregularities. The high-magnitude wheel loads produced by a small percentage of &#8220;bad&#8221; wheels or rail head surface defects are crudely accounted for in the Australian Standard AS 1085.14 by a single load amplification factor. In addition, there is a widespread perception within the railway engineering community that the carrying capacity of the existing track infrastructure is not fully utilised, and concrete sleepers possess significant amounts of untapped reserve strength. This can be attributed to the current design philosophy for concrete sleepers, outlined in AS 1085.14. This is based on the assessment of permissible stresses resulting from quasi-static wheel loads and essentially the static response of concrete sleepers, making it unduly conservative and very costly for the railway organisations. This thesis addresses the identified deficiencies of the current design method through an in-depth analysis of the dynamic response of concrete sleepers under realistic loading conditions and proposes a more rational design procedure.In order to shift the conventional methodology to a more rational design method that involves more realistic dynamic response of concrete sleepers and performance-based design methodology, a significant research effort within the framework of the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Railway Engineering and Technologies has been carried out to perform comprehensive studies of the loading conditions, the dynamic response, and the dynamic resistance of prestressed concrete sleepers. The collaborative research between the University of Wollongong (UoW) and Queensland University of Technology (QUT) has addressed such important issues as the spectrum and amplitudes of dynamic forces applied to the railway track, evaluation of the reserve capacity of typical prestressed concrete sleepers designed to the current code AS 1085.14, and the development of a new limit states design concept.The comprehensive literature review highlighted the extremely limited research work that previously had been done in this field of research. In order to enhance an understanding of the dynamic performance of railway tracks, the first part of this thesis investigates the dynamic characteristics of the global railway track and its individual components with particular reference to rail pads and prestressed concrete (PC) sleepers. The experimental techniques for extracting dynamic properties of track components, developed in the laboratory, have been successfully applied in field trials. Moreover, this thesis provides an intensive review aimed at predicting wheel impact loads due to the wheel/rail irregularities at different return periods (based on the field data from wheel impact detectors).The experimental and numerical investigations into the dynamic behaviour of prestressed concrete sleepers subjected to severe impact loading are then presented. The impact tests were carried out using the prestressed concrete sleepers manufactured in Australia. A track test bed was simulated in the laboratory and calibrated against the frequency response functions obtained for real tracks. A series of incremental impact loading tests for the prestressed concrete sleepers was performed, ranging from a typical design load to a severe wheel load. The cumulative impact damage and crack propagation in concrete sleepers were identified. The effects of track environment together with the relationship between the bending moment of prestressed concrete sleepers and the applied impact force are also presented.The later part of this thesis identifies the responses of prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under both single and repeated impact loads associated with different probabilities of occurrence. The residual capacities of the damaged prestressed concrete sleepers are studied in order to clarify the notion about the reserve strength of the concrete sleepers. The numerical investigations of the static and impact behaviours of railway prestressed concrete sleepers under static and dynamic loads were also undertaken to supplement the experimental findings in this thesis.A proposal for the reliability-based design concepts and rationales associated with the development of limit states design procedures for the conversion of AS 1085.14 to a limit states design format is one of the key outcomes of this thesis. The new limit states design concepts and procedures for railway prestressed concrete sleepers are presented as the design guidelines for the railway engineers. The new methodology is aimed not only to save the material resources to achieve financial gains, but also to reduce the amount of cement production which would otherwise emit carbon dioxide as a contributing factor towards global warming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/277</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactive molluscan resources  and  their conservation:  biological and chemical studies on the egg masses of marine molluscs</field><field name="creator">Benkendorff, Kirsten</field><field name="description">Chemical prospecting for pharmaceuticals in natural organisms (bioprospecting) can be used as a tool for the conservation of biological diversity. However, bioprospecting can only be considered compatible with conservation if it is conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner. In order to prevent the overcollection of vulnerable organisms it is essential to gain an understanding of the local distribution and abundance of the target organisms. In this study, the egg masses of intertidal molluscs were targeted as a novel source of biologically active compounds. Surveys of the molluscan fauna were conducted on 13 intertidal reefs along the Wollongong Coast, New South Wales, Australia. In total, 161 species of intertidal molluscs were found and the benthic egg masses from 47 species were identified. Only 31% of these molluscs have been previously recorded from intertidal surveys in the region and 66% of the species may be regarded as regionally rare. Repeated surveys of the 13 reefs revealed that the species diversity recorded in a single inventory was representative of the cumulative diversity detected. &#8216;Hotspots&#8217; of molluscan diversity were found on the northern side of two large headlands (Bass Point and Bellambi Point), which are characterised by a high habitat complexity and shelter from strong wave action.   Three selective pressures could potentially lead to the evolution of chemical defence in molluscan egg masses: predation, disease and surface fouling. Marine molluscs may rely on a range of alternative strategies to protect their egg masses from predators, including physical protection in leathery egg capsules, camouflage and rapid embryonic development, as well as behavioural mechanisms, such as brooding and the deposition of large aggregated egg masses. Predator feeding trials provided evidence of chemical defence in five out of eight species that were tested. On the other hand, observational studies provided no evidence to suggest that molluscan egg masses are chemically defended against surface fouling by macroorganisms. A range of macrophytes and epizooites were observed on the surface of both gelatinous egg masses and leathery egg capsules. Nevertheless, the overall incidence of fouling was low, probably because of their ephemeral nature and the fact that most molluscs deposit egg masses on the underside of boulders.   Disease appears to be a significant selective pressure leading to the evolution of chemical defence in molluscan egg masses. Two assays were used to screen the egg masses of marine molluscs for antimicrobial activity against human and marine pathogens; a modified version of the traditional Zone of Inhibition assay and the Fluorescein Diacetate assay. These two assays have small sample requirements and thus it was possible to screen the egg masses of 42 molluscs and four polychaetes. Antimicrobial activity against at least one human pathogen was found in the egg masses of 36 species, including two polychaetes and a wide range of molluscs. The egg masses from a number of species clearly lose activity during embryonic development. The antimicrobial activity also appears to be greater in the internal matrix, rather than on the outer surfaces of molluscan egg masses. Surface bacteria could be responsible for the observed activity in some species but are unlikely to be the source of antimicrobial agents in leathery egg capsules, or the gelatinous egg ribbons of Aplysia spp. The egg masses of Dicathais orbita and Aplysia juliana were found to inhibit ecologically significant marine bacteria, as well as Gram negative and Gram positive human pathogenic bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans.  The compounds responsible for the antimicrobial activity in the egg masses of the common muricid Dicathais orbita were isolated using bioassay-guided fractionation. These were then identified by mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Three antimicrobial compounds were characterised (tyrindoleninone, tyriverdin and 6-bromoisatin) and these are all known precursors to the ancient dye Tyrian Purple. Tyrindoleninone is the most abundant volatile organic compound found in the fresh eggs and this compound was shown to be toxic to bacteria at a concentration of 1mg/ml. As the eggs develop, most of the tyrindoleninone is converted into tyriverdin, which was found to be effectively bacteriostatic at 0. 5 &#181;g/ml but was not cytotoxic at 1 mg/ml. This compound is considered to be a useful new drug lead. The 6-bromoisatin, which is likely to be an oxidative artefact derived from the other precursors, exhibited mild cytolytic activity against a range of bacteria. As the larvae began hatching, most of the tyriverdin was converted into Tyrian Purple in the egg masses. Tyrian Purple did not exhibit any significant antimicrobial activity, although it is highly insoluble in aqueous media. Nevertheless, these studies provide evidence for a chemical ripening process in the egg masses of Dicathais orbita, which may provide a means of avoiding autotoxicity to the larvae during hatching.  Extracts from the egg masses of 23 molluscs were then examined for the precursors of Tyrian Purple, as well as other potential antimicrobial agents, using gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. The egg masses from six species of Muricidae were found to contain the precursors of Tyrian Purple. However, these compounds were not found in the egg masses of species from any other family. A range of other related indoles, as well as di- and tribromoimidazoles/pyrazoles were also found in the egg masses of the Muricidae. Most of these compounds have not been previously described from a natural source and they could all contribute to the observed antimicrobial activity in the muricid egg masses. The egg masses of the Aplysiidae were found to contain some bioactive polychlorinated hydrocarbons and a range of long chain unsaturated fatty acids. Halogenated compounds were not found in the egg masses of any other species, although fatty acids could be partly responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity in most of the gelatinous egg masses. A high diversity of volatile organic compounds was found in the molluscan egg masses, but further work is required to identify the active components.  Clearly, bioprospecting can contribute to conservation through the development of comprehensive species inventories. Bioprospecting can be conducted with minimal impact on the environment and the discovery of novel bioactive compounds provides an incentive for conservation. All marine molluscs that deposit benthic egg masses have potential pharmaceutical value and therefore an effort should be made to conserve both them and their natural habitats. Bass Point would be an appropriate site for an intertidal protected area in the Wollongong region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/278</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A professional learning partnership (PLP): connecting pre-service and practicing teachers in a technology supported environment</field><field name="creator">Olney, Ian</field><field name="description">There are concerns about the adequate preparation of pre-service teachers, and the ongoing professional development of teachers in our schools, in relation to the appropriate use of information and communications technologies in the classroom. The current professional development for practicing teachers and pre-service teachers is generally inadequate, often being in short, unrelated doses, and there is an overlap or duplication of many of these experiences. Both groups need to bridge the various gaps that are created during the preparation and as part of the ongoing professional experience that occurs in schools. These gaps relate to the changing of systems and the various expectations of the structures teachers move into. This study investigates the design and impact of a &#8220;professional learning partnership&#8221; (PLP), that was established between pre-service teachers and practicing teachers in our schools. Within the bounds of an established one year teacher education program a small cohort of practicing teachers acted as &#8220;online mentors&#8221; for pre-service teachers, who, with minimal classroom experience, were challenged with the norms of classroom practice on their school practicums. Information and communications technologies were used as the catalyst for discussion and set task analysis. A technology-supported environment was created online that linked these evolving groups and allowed both expected and unexpected interactions to occur. The analysis of these interactions has led to a set of recommendations that will help advise key players and teacher preparation institutions who engage in future implementations of similar partnerships. In the current context of determining teaching standards such a learning partnership will also inform the guidelines that may be necessary to allow a teacher&#8217;s career to be supported as a professional development continuum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/739</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Algorithms, microtonality, performance: eleven musical compositions</field><field name="creator">Burt, Warren</field><field name="description">Following a lifetime of creative work and investigation into algorithmic composition and microtonality, I became interested in the speculative mathematical music theory of Ervin Wilson. Encountering his work spurred me on to further investigations in sound and tuning, in a series of compositions using electronic, acoustic, and robotic acoustic instruments. Tuning ideas developed by Wilson and others were extended and expanded into several families of new microtonal musical scales, which were used as the basis for composing a series of algorithmic real-time musical works of extended duration. Some of these works involved collaborative relationships with other musicians, hardware and software instrument designers, and scientists. Wilson&#8217;s ideas, such as Moments of Symmetry (MOS) scales, Euler-Fokker Genera, limit-ratios, the Scale Tree, and additive sequences and their derivation from number triangles, as well as other tuning ideas, such as permutations of the materials of the ancient Greek modal system were all extended and developed into families of interrelated microtonal scales. The desire to compose works of extended duration was aided by the large size of some of these scale families, which consist of between 60 and 276 new scales each. Acoustic instruments were built or adapted to perform some of these works, including microtonal plucked-string and percussion instruments, and the computer-controlled microtonal instruments of Godfried Willem Raes at the Logos Foundation, in Gent, Belgium. Other works used electronic timbres designed to explore placing of sound in space produced by the interaction of timbre, tuning and room acoustics. Software instruments designed to perform the algorithms used were developed in collaboration with John Dunn of Algorithmic Arts, in Fort Worth, Texas. Investigation into the role of timbre and tuning in sonification was carried out with the help of the Wollongong Room Calorimeter project, led by Professor Arthur Jenkins. This thesis discusses how these tunings, algorithms, real-time processes, instruments, and collaborative relationships were used in creating these compositions.

Several fieldtrips to the island of Efate the main island, site of the capital Port Vila enabled meetings with the visual art milieu of craftspeople, artists, the Vanuatu Cultural Centre and Museum, the two Art Foundations Michoutouchkine and Susanne Bastien, as well as commercial outlets.  It confirmed my interest in setting up conversations between my own art practice in Australia with individual artists in Vanuatu through two conferences, firstly the Pacific Arts Association IXth International Symposium Mus&#233;e du quay Branly in 2007 in Paris and secondly, the Pacific International Museum Association in Port Vila in 2008. My research, which includes two exhibitions, presents a working strategy based in artistic process for developing an on-going dialogue between artists from the Pacific and non-Indigenous Australian culture. Core concerns for island communities such those in Vanuatu include an understanding of the multiplicity within island cultures, a developing relationship between genders and a situation of constant change and development in relation to dominant external influences. &#8232;&#8232;My research built on insights from recent exhibitions by indigenous and non-indigenous artists and curators, which included work from, mixed cultural backgrounds such as Weaving the Murray (Art Gallery of South Australia and Prospect Gallery, Adelaide 2002), News from Islands (Campbelltown Art Centre 2007), and Woven forms (Object Gallery, Sydney and Form Gallery, Perth 2006).My collaborative research and exhibition document my encounter with two ni-Vanuatu artist/craftspeople Eric and Linda Natuoivi. Eric Natuoivi was already acknowledged as a leading Pacific artist through his involvement in the Asia Pacific Triennial of 1996, while his wife Linda is a highly regarded weaver within her community, but unknown outside Vanuatu. &#8232;Key issues that emerge are the interactions between artists and between artists and audience; the power relations between cultures and institutions, and facilitating the needs of artists from very different cultural situations. The exhibition Encounters in Vanuatu (FCA gallery 2009) documents the processes of these interactions as well as presenting important examples of Eric and Linda Natuoivi&#8217;s works.

It is also a study of state endeavours for the survival of these two states. The investigation was founded on the view that traditional state explanations of international relations do not satisfactorily account for the complexity of how state-society interactions in these two countries influence their internal and external efforts towards their state survival. The thesis is also innovative in that there have been almost no studies that have researched the two countries, side by side. Section One of the thesis provides a theoretical framework and explanatory tools &#8211; a theoretical framework in international relations through examining globalisation and fragmentation. In exploring the bases for the survival of the state, this thesis investigates the link between domestic political conditions and foreign policy responses by employing the explanatory tools of the state-in-society analysis and foreign policy behaviour analysis. By so doing, the studies presented in this thesis enable the capture of the dynamics of intensified state-society interactions in two different states, and show how these influence the survival of the state. In particular, it considers the difference between a weak state and a strong state. A weak state is limited in its state strength in terms of compliance, government legitimacy and participation and ability to create social cohesion. On the other hand, a state that can maximise its state strength is a strong state. It is argued that both kinds of states have different abilities when responding and adapting to the challenges of globalisation. Section Two explores domestic and foreign policy in PNG. The first study is a critical examination of the interaction between the state and society in a weak state &#8211; PNG. It is argued that a state that is being challenged by domestic social forces is weakened, but also that a weak state is not necessarily synonymous with a weak society. The second part of Section Two offers a critical and comprehensive examination of the foreign policy responses of PNG and how it has responded to its external challenges. It is shown to be a country with limited available state resources and foreign policy options. Therefore, it is also argued that PNG's foreign policy behaviour must be considered from the point of view of the ongoing need for the survival of the state, that is, &#8216;friends to all, enemies to none&#8217;.Section Three is a critical examination of how particular social forces penetrate the policy-making of a state in domestic politics and in the foreign policy arena in Japan. It is argued that Japan's hierarchical structure is a fundamental cause for the intensified state-society interaction, and results in certain social forces penetrating the policy-making of the state by gaining proximity to the highest authorities of the state. In domestic politics, it is argued that the penetration of policy-making by certain social forces weakened state capacity, and ultimately resulted in the annihilation of non-conservative politics that led Japan's political transformation in the 1990s. In the foreign policy arena, it is argued that the penetration of policy-making by particular social forces occurred because Japan's Official Development Assistance provides relative material power that the state leaders and elite can mobilise as a powerful diplomatic tool, minimising its foreign policy vulnerability, while maximising its strategic foreign policy objectives. It is therefore argued that Japan&#8217;s state-society interactions determine its external responses. This thesis has shown how state-society interaction in PNG and Japan has influenced various responses for their survival. The studies throughout the thesis show that while the state that is a strong state has greater capacity than a state that is a weak state, a society in a weak state possesses greater resilience and tenaciousness than its counterpart society in a strong state.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/144</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of novel high-amplitude oscillations in skin blood flow</field><field name="creator">Haley, Cassandra D</field><field name="description">Regulation of skin blood flow (Q.sk) is vital to homeostasis, with adjustments to flow in response to important sympathetic thermal and non-thermal reflexes and by other factors which remain to be fully determined, but include local regulatory mechanisms (i.e. axon reflexes, release of endothelial vasoactive substances etc.). Laser-Doppler flowmetry is a well-known technique, used for assessing microvascular function, with raw Q.sk traces displaying marked variability, which is in part due to the above mechanisms, but also results from passive influences (i.e. oscillations in pressure resulting from cardiac frequency (fc) or respiration (fb), alterations to local transmural pressure and turbulences in flow due to vessel structure and or the viscosity of blood). The central focus of this dissertation was an investigation and characterisation of an apparently hidden, novel Q.sk phenomenon, which has not been previously reported in the literature, possibly due to traditional data processing techniques. This phenomenon encompasses high-amplitude oscillations in Q.sk which were detected using laser-Doppler flowmetry in human and rat Q.sk, which have a characteristic frequency of ~0.4 Hz, spanning ~1000 ms, and consist of high-amplitude peaks, accounting for up to a seven-fold increase of basal Q.sk.  Experiments presented within this thesis confirm the biological nature of these oscillations, which are present in both acral and non-acral skin regions. These oscillations, increase significantly with increases in local and mean skin temperature (Tsk; humans and rats Q.sk; P&lt;0.05) and may occur independently of core temperature. Further, these oscillations appear to be unaffected by global changes in mean arterial pressure within the normotensive range (P&gt;0.05). Local application of anaesthetic (i.e. to remove vessel tone) attenuated these oscillations in response to whole-body heating. However, propranolol treatment (80mg; orally) produced no significant differences in the characteristics of these oscillations (P&gt;0.05), despite producing a significant reduction in fc (~ 10 b&#8226;min-1; P&lt;0.05). Differences in baroreceptor loading between a supine and seated posture (as reflected by a significant increase in fc of ~ 10 b&#8226;min-1 in the seated posture; P&lt;0.05) produced no differences in the frequency of the high-amplitude oscillations at the forearm when recorded at heart level (~ 0.4 Hz). However, measurements at the thigh in the seated posture, displayed a significant decrease in the frequency of these oscillations (reduction of ~0.3 Hz) when compared to the supine position (P&lt;0.05). In addition, alterations to local vessel pressure by movement of the position of the Q.sk measurement site above or below heart level significantly increased the frequency of these oscillations (by ~0.2 Hz and ~0.1 Hz respectively; P&lt;0.05). Remarkably, additional manipulations of local pressure by means of upper arm occlusion (2 min; to either ~90 or 240mmHg), increased the frequency of these oscillations in some subjects, while in others a reduction in frequency was observed (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, time frequency analysis, shows that these oscillations occur independently of fc and fb.   Taken together, it is likely that sympathetic nervous system has a minimal role in the induction of these oscillations (i.e. not associated with an active vasodilator mechanism, as this system is lacking in acral regions) and the oscillations occurring under conditions where the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone to the skin would be expected to be minimal (e.g. hyperthermia). Local threshold-dependent thermal mechanisms (i.e. Tsk ~35-36&#186;C) may mediate these oscillations. However, since these oscillations have also been detected under normothermic conditions in the thigh and forearm in human subjects (Tsk ~32-33&#186;C), it is also possible that local temperature may exacerbate or facilitate non-thermal mechanisms, leading to the induction of these oscillations. The other possibilities are that multiple mechanisms may account for the high-amplitude oscillations, or that the threshold skin temperature for the induction of these oscillations varies with experimental conditions. However, if non-thermal factors account for the high-amplitude oscillations, then the results support a local passive mechanism, as these oscillations appear to be unaffected by central changes in vascular pressure (i.e. mean arterial pressure and oscillations in intravascular pressure due to fc and fb), yet are greatly affected by local alterations to pressure and vessel tone. The exact local passive mechanism behind these oscillations remains to be determined, but is likely to be common across skin regions and species, and the physiological relevance of the high-amplitude oscillations may relate to enhanced tissue perfusion, and or heat transfer through the cutaneous circulation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/61</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of hydrological, geomorphological and climatological characteristics of natural catchments on lag parameters</field><field name="creator">Bodhinayake, Nanayakkara Dayananda</field><field name="description">Catchment lag time is considered as a key factor in flood hydrograph modelling and design. The extensive literature investigation of this study revealed that most of the lag time equations that have been developed include various hydrological, geomorphological and climatological characteristics of the catchment. However, different studies use different combinations of these variables, and therefore, the appropriate context of the relation is not known with confidence. The intention of this research is to determine to what extent the above mentioned catchment characteristics influence the lag parameter, which is directly related to the catchment&#8217;s lag time. In order to assess the influence of catchment characteristics on the lag parameter, reliable and valid rainfall and flow data must be analysed. Therefore, at the outset of this research, the reliability and validity of rainfall data of seventeen rural catchments in Queensland, Australia, were examined. These catchments belong to five river basins and they are, Mary, Haughton, Herbert, Don and Johnstone. A total of 254 storm events on these catchments were analysed. To compute the lag parameters of the catchments, the computer based Watershed Bounded Network Model (WBNM) was selected due to its in-built non-linearity property as well as other capabilities. These include the ability to model spatially varying rainfall, the simplicity of data files and the requirement of a minimum amount of data. The constantslope method was adopted to separate the base flow from the recorded total hydrograph in order to derive the ordinates of the surface runoff hydrograph, which is one of the essential components for the input file of WBNM. The time variation of the rainfall was examined by means of mass curves of rainfall and the spatial variability of the rainfall was studied with the help of isohyetal plots. Thereafter the rainfall and flow data, as well as the physical features of the catchments, were incorporated into WBNM to generate hydrographs for all 254 storm events. The lag parameter was altered until WBNM generated a hydrograph that closely resembled the recorded surface runoff hydrograph. This process was repeated for each storm event to obtain its lag parameter value. From this method, lag parameter values were derived for all 254 storm events on the seventeen catchments. The next stage of the analysis involved testing to determine whether the lag parameter is related to a range of hydrological, geomorphological and climatological variables. To carry out the analysis the necessary hydrological characteristics were extracted from the storm data. Other useful geomorphological and climatological characteristics were obtained from AUSLIG maps and the Bureau of Meteorology. If the lag relations built into WBNM are sufficient to account for those variables, then no significant relation between the lag parameter and those variables should exist when the lag parameter is plotted against each variable. The lag parameter (C) versus a range of hydrological, geomorphological and climatological characteristics of all seventeen catchments were plotted to examine their correlation. Two tailed statistical t-tests were carried out for each plot to find out whether the gradients of best-fit straight lines of those plots are significantly different from zero at 5% level of significance. The results of this research have shown that there are no strong relationships between the lag parameter (C) and the range of catchment characteristics selected for this study. Therefore, the lag parameter can be considered as an independent factor applying to a wide range of catchments. While this research was carried out for the WBNM model, its essential findings, that the non-linearity power is near to 0.23, and that the dominant variable influencing catchment lag time is the catchment area, also apply to other flood hydrograph models.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/385</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal growth, magnetism, transport and superconductivity of two dimensional sodium cobalt oxide single crystals</field><field name="creator">Chen, Dapeng</field><field name="description">The objective of this work was to study the single crystal growth of NaxCoO2 by the optical floating zone technique and the intrinsic properties of the high quality single crystal samples thus produced. The properties of the superconductors derived from it will also be reported. This thesis, after a literature review on the NaxCoO2 family and the superconductors derived from it, reports a systematic study on growing NaxCoO2 (x = 0.32&#8211;1.00) and NaxCoO2 &#8226; yH2O (x = 0.22&#8211;0.47, y = 1.3). The experiments demonstrate that nearly pure &#945;- (x = 0.90&#8211;1.00) and &#940;- (x = 0.75) phases of NaxCoO2 crystals could be obtained using the optical floating zone method, while other phases with lower sodium content, x &lt; 0.70 (&#946;-phase with x = 0.55, 0.60 and &#947;-phase with x = 0.65 and 0.70, respectively), are observed always to contain Na2O, Co3O4, and Na-poor phases. There is experimental evidence that the dependence of the superconducting transition temperature on Na content is much weaker than reported earlier. Implications of the Na effect for understanding of the structure, thermoelectricity, and superconducting phase diagram are discussed. Na-extraction and hydration were carried out on the &#945;- and &#940;-samples to obtain the superconducting phase. Hydrated single crystals exhibit cracked layers perpendicular to the c-axis, due to a large expansion when the water is inserted into the structure. A study of intercalation/de-intercalation was performed to determine the stability of the hydrated phase and the effects of hydration on the structure of the compound. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric experiments were used to monitor the processes of accommodation of water molecules and their removal from the crystal lattice. The initial intercalation process takes place with two water molecules (corresponding to y = 0.6) inserted in a formula unit, followed by a group of four (y = 1.3) to form a Na(H2O)4 cluster. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that de-intercalation occurs with the removal of the water molecules one by one from the hydrated cluster at elevated temperatures of approximately 50, 100, 200, and 300oC. Our investigations reveal that the hydration process is dynamic and that water molecule intercalation and de-intercalation follow different reaction paths in an irreversible way. This thesis also contains intensive studies on the cobalt oxide superconductors NaxCoO2 &#8226; 1.3H2O based on 59Co nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements. For the sample with x = 0.26 and critical temperature Tc = 4.6 K, it was found that the spin&#8211;lattice relaxation rate, 1/T1, shows a T3 variation below Tc and down to very low temperatures, which indicates the presence of line nodes in the superconducting (SC) gap function. The spin susceptibility below Tc for these samples was also studied via Knight shift measurements. The spin part of the Knight shift decreases below Tc in both the a- and c- directions, indicating a singlet spin state of the Cooper pairs. Our results strongly suggest that the superconducting state is a d-wave state. Based on bulk measurements of the electron momentum distribution, using the technique of x-ray Compton scattering, we present evidence that small, elliptically shaped pockets do indeed exist in the Fermi surface of cobalt oxide superconductors. The magnetic properties of two-layer NaxCoO2 (x = 0.42, 0.82, and 0.87) were studied. The magnetic susceptibility measurements revealed considerable anisotropy along H//ab and H//c for the as-grown single crystals. It was found that an antiferromagnetic transition with N&#233;el temperature, TN = 21 K, occurred for the x = 0.82 sample, and there was a paramagnetic phase for the x = 0.87 sample over a wide temperature range from 2 to 300 K, while the sample with x = 0.42 showed a monotonic increase of &#967; with increasing temperature above ~100 K. In addition, the x = 0.82 sample had the largest derived anisotropic g-factor ratio (gab/gc &amp;asymp; 1.30), whereas the sample with x = 0.42 was nearly isotropic (gab/gc &amp;asymp; 0.96). Magnetic susceptibility measurements on three-layer alpha-NaxCoO2 (x = 0.91, 0.92, and 0.93) showed that the magnetic properties depend strongly on x. The compound was found to be antiferromagnetic at TN &amp;asymp; 20 K for x = 0.91 and x = 0.92, and paramagnetic for x = 0.93. In-plane and out-of-plane anisotropy were observed for the x = 0.91 crystals. In addition, the anisotropic g-factor ratio (gab/gc) derived from the anisotropic susceptibility along H//ab and H//c decreased significantly as the sodium composition increased from x = 0.91 to x = 0.93. A systematic study was also carried out on the conduction mechanism and the anisotropy of the electrical transport properties of the &#945;-Na0.91CoO2 single crystals. The resistivity was found to show a large anisotropy along the ab plane and the c axis. The resistivity below the metal-to-insulator transition temperature (20 K) can be well fitted by the variable-range hopping model. The high temperature range can be fitted well by &#961;(T) = &#961;0 + A&#969;s/sinh2(&#1115;&#969;s/2kBT) + BT7/2, both for the in-plane and the out-of-plane behaviours. Such behaviour provides evidence for small polaron and spin-wave scattering metallic conduction in heavily Na-doped sodium cobaltate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/405</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of automated dietary assessment: a case study into the development, implementation and evaluation of Computer-Assisted Survey Technology as an adjunct to professional dietary consultation</field><field name="creator">Probst, Yasmine Christa</field><field name="description">Dietary assessment has changed dramatically with time, progressing from face-to-face interviews and hand calculated nutrient intakes to the use of computer technology to automate various parts of the process. The most common application is the use of software packages to calculate nutrient intake data obtained from dietary interviews. The development of technology to automate the interview process will allow for clinicians to spend more time focussing on patient education and counselling. The central hypothesis tested in this thesis was that automated dietary assessment would prove to be a feasible adjunct to the professional consultation in the primary healthcare setting.Development phase A series of studies were conducted examining various aspects of computer-assisted survey technology (CAST) applied to dietary advice in the primary healthcare setting. The research is presented as a case study, using action research methodology. Items in the dietary survey were developed from data reduction of food lists reported in the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey (NNS95), in conjunction with professional interpretation and judgement. The opinions and beliefs of patients from focus group interviews shaped development of the user interface and a dynamic website was developed to best allow for a diversity of eating patterns.Testing phase Video-recorded usability testing found the website to be user friendly with the time taken to complete the survey comparable to the time taken for a dietitian to interview and assess a patient&#8217;s food intake. The website was then implemented in the primary healthcare setting over a period of twelve months. Computers were set-up in fourteen medical practices in the Illawarra region of NSW, Australia. Doctors recruited patients with metabolic syndrome to use the website. Data was sent to a dietitian in the research team for development of an individualised dietary prescription, which was then sent back to the doctor to discuss with the patient.Implementation phase A cross-section of 200 patients revealed the majority of users were aged between 46 and 65 years, overweight and physically inactive. Computer ownership was identified in 80% of the users, with only 8% of patients having never used a computer previously. The computer located in the medical practice was the least preferred location of use and patients with a higher BMI were 1.9 times (p=0.04) more likely to use the computer in the home or an alternate location than at the medical practice. Reported nutrient data was highly variable. Under-reporting was observed in 46 patients (32.2%), overreporting in 31 (21.7%) of patients and 66 patients (46.2%) reported their intakes on target. No relationships were found for the reporting status of the patients and their age, BMI or gender.A repeatability study with n=38 patients revealed a learning effect which led to increased understanding of the website functions with time. Compared to a 3-day weighed food record, data from the website produced stronger correlations than a face-to-face diet history assessment. Patients using the website achieved an average 25% of their dietary goals within six weeks, despite a preference for face-to-face contact with the dietitian. Stakeholder evaluation established acceptance of the technology by dietitians, doctors and patients and provided insights into their positions within the healthcare system.Evaluation phase The research found that computerised assessment of dietary intake was a feasible addition to daily practice in the primary healthcare setting. Automating the diet history interview via the internet allowed increased patient access to dietitians whilst improving the doctors&#8217; awareness of the nutrition needs of their patients. This is especially important in the growing light of metabolic syndrome worldwide.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/770</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Verification of an independent monitor unit calculation program for IMRT quality assurance</field><field name="creator">Currie, Michael Peter</field><field name="description">Independent monitor unit (MU) calculations are a vital part of radiotherapy treatment planning quality assurance. In the case of complex treatment planning methods, such as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), traditional independent monitor unit calculations using tables of beam data and manual calculations are inadequate. Recently, computer programs have been developed that can perform independent monitor unit calculations for IMRT treatment plans using scatter summation methods. One such program is RadCalc, produced by Lifeline Software Inc. The purpose of this project was to test RadCalc, and determine whether it is suitable for routine use in IMRT treatment planning quality assurance.Once the software was installed, beam data measured on the treatment linear accelerator (linac) was imported into RadCalc, to be used in MU calculations. RadCalc was tested for data integrity to ensure that the correct data was accessed for its calculations. The interface between RadCalc and the treatment planning system, Pinnacle3, was set up so that treatment plan data could be imported directly from Pinnacle3 into RadCalc. Test plans were imported into RadCalc to ensure the Pinnacle3-RadCalc interface was working correctly.Test plans were created with open, blocked, segmented and IMRT fields, and delivered to a phantom on the linac to test RadCalc&#8217;s block correction algorithm. Doses were measured using a thimble ionisation chamber, and compared to the doses calculated by RadCalc and Pinnacle3. The agreement between RadCalc and measured doses for most situations was comparable to the agreement between Pinnacle3 and measured doses. However, a systematic difference between RadCalc and measured dose was shown to occur for asymmetric fields. In addition to this, an increase in the level of blocking of the calculation point for segmented and IMRT fields appeared to increase the difference between RadCalc and measured dose.Thirty-two patient IMRT plans at the Illawarra Cancer Care Centre (ICCC) were verified by reproducing the plan using a phantom CT dataset, and then delivering the fields to the phantom and measuring the delivered dose. This data was compared to the doses calculated by RadCalc and Pinnacle3. The doses calculated by RadCalc and Pinnacle3 for the plans created on patient CT datasets were also compared. In analysing the data, a systematic difference between RadCalc and measured dose was detected. Improved agreement was achieved by adjusting the MLC transmission parameter in RadCalc. The average percentage difference per field for the phantom plans between RadCalc and measured dose was 0.1% with a standard deviation 5.3%, while the average percentage difference between Pinnacle3 and measured dose was -0.2% with a standard deviation of 4.2%. The average percentage difference for total plan dose for the phantom plans between RadCalc and measured dose was 0.0% with a standard deviation 1.7%, while the average percentage difference between Pinnacle3 and measured dose was -0.3% with a standard deviation of 1.1%. For the patient plans, the average percentage difference per field between RadCalc and Pinnacle3 was 0.8% with a standard deviation of 5.6%, while the average percentage difference per plan was 1.1% with a standard deviation of 1.1%.The final recommendation is that RadCalc is accurate enough for routine IMRT treatment planning quality assurance. A physical measurement should accompany the RadCalc check to verify the transfer of data to the record and verify system and the dose delivery process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/670</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of radiolabelled peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligands for imaging cancer and neurodegenerative disorders</field><field name="creator">Homes, Taryn P</field><field name="description">Three classes of compounds were chosen for investigation to find a high affinity and selective iodinated peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand; indol-3-ylglyoxylamides, pyrazolopyrimidines, and pyridopyrrolooxazepines and pyrrolobenzoxazepines. These compounds were chosen from a literature search for their high PBR affinity and selectivity, ease of synthesis, and the potential for radioiodination.Fifteen new halogenated N,N-dialkylindol-3-ylglyoxylamides were synthesised and tested for their PBR and central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) affinity. The compounds IC50 values for the PBR ranged from 7.8 &#8211; 618 nM, and a structure activity relationship (SAR) was determined. Brominated compounds had higher binding affinities than their iodinated analogues, and indoles with a chloro substituent on position 5 had higher binding affinities than the non-chlorinated compounds. The optimum alkyl chain length was found to be two carbons. The highest affinity iodinated ligand, with a PBR IC50 of 8.2 nM, was radiolabelled with 123I in 55-60% radiochemical yield and evaluated in vivo in Sprague-Dawley rats. Biodistribution studies revealed high uptake of the radiotracer in organs known to contain PBR, such as the kidneys, adrenals, heart, liver and lungs. Drug competition studies showed that the PBR drugs PK11195 and Ro5-4864, when injected into the rat 5 min prior to injection of the radiotracer, significantly decreased uptake of radiotracer into those organs. The CBR drug, flumazenil, did not decrease the uptake of the radiotracer. Metabolite studies showed that the radiotracer was &gt; 95% intact in the heart, kidneys, adrenals, and brain after 3 h and was 65% intact in the plasma. This compound is the first radiolabelled PBR ligand of this class, and is an excellent candidate for future studies and may lead to a clinically useful imaging agent.Three pyrazolopyrimidines were synthesised, with lengths of the alkyl chains being methyl, ethyl, or propyl groups. The highest affinity ligand, with the propyl groups, displayed an IC50 of 7.9 nM, however, only the compound with ethyl groups displaying an IC50 of 11.7 nM was radiolabelled with 123I in 95% radiochemical yield, and evaluated in vivo in rats. This compound showed high uptake into organs known to contain PBR, and also showed an interesting result in which pre-administration of Ro5-4864 did not cause any significant decrease of uptake of radiotracer in the kidney or heart, however PK11195 did cause of significant decrease in these organs. This compound provides the first radioiodinated PBR ligand of this class.Two pyrrolopyridooxazepines and two pyrrolobenzoxazepines were synthesised and tested. One of the compounds was found to be inactive, while the others had moderate PBR IC50 values of 24-39 nM. The moderate binding affinity for these compounds would unlikely lead to a successful imaging agent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/65</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbulent plumes generated by a horizontal area source of buoyancy</field><field name="creator">Chaengbamrung, Apichart</field><field name="description">Plumes generated from hot surfaces may contain fumes and other contaminants that constitute major health and environmental hazards. Current design techniques of contaminated plume control for area sources of heat have limited applicability, and provide little information on plume characteristics such as vertical velocity distribution, density distribution, etc. in the zone near the source.This study is an experimental and computational (CFD) investigation into the fundamental processes of plume generation and dispersion from a hot area source, such as a hot metal bath, blast furnaces etc. The main aims are to provide quantitative data and theoretical models that will enable engineers/designers to greatly improve the efficiency of exhaust systems and reduce exposure of workers and the community to harmful contaminants.The main aim of this project was to conduct a fundamental investigation into the complex processes of plume generation from a hot surface of finite size and its subsequent dispersion. Particular objectives included: 1. Use of experimental techniques to investigate plume characteristics such as velocity and density/temperature fields. 2. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of velocity and temperature fields. 3. Validation of the CFD simulations, using analytical solutions and specific experiments of increasing complexity.The experimental work was conducted in two distinct programs. In the first part, saline plumes generated from a uniform area source descending into quiescent water were studied. This represented a &#8216;cold flow&#8217; analogy of thermal plumes ascending in quiescent air. A 1.4m cubed environmental tank was designed, built and commissioned in which experiments were carried out. Experiments are described in which the velocity and salt concentration profiles in the plume were measured. Two-dimensional velocity profiles were determined using a PTV (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) technique. The plume shape was recorded on video tape and also analysed using the DigImage PTV analysis software. A special conductivity probe with digital position control was used to measure the concentration of salt solution (or plume density distribution) both inside and outside the plume at different levels within a 1.4m cubed environmental tank. In the CFD simulations, two geometries were used to determine plume characteristics and were compared with experimental results.In the second program, thermal plumes generated from a uniform temperature area source were investigated inside a glass enclosure. Both vertical and horizontal velocity profiles were measured using the LDV (Laser Doppler Velocimetry) technique. Fine thermocouples were used to measure the temperature distribution of in the plume inside the enclosure. CFD analysis of confined and unconfined thermal plumes was carried out.Saline plume experiments showed that the plume flow from an area source can be modelled as two regions, one from the area source to the plume neck and the second region beyond the neck. The saline plume radius was measured using the Shadowgraph and the Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique. The plume radius determined by the Shadowgraph technique and image analysis was greater than the plume radius determined by the vertical velocity analysis by approximately 50%.It was found that the Gaussian equation is suitable as a model of the vertical velocity and density distributions where the plume reaches the self-similarity region but in the region near an area source, a proposed modification to the Gaussian equation showed a better fit than the standard Gaussian equation. The centreline vertical velocity as a function of height by experiment showed two distinct regions and this supports the work of Colomer, et al. (1999). In the first region, the present experimental results showed the same pattern as the model of Colomer, et al. but in the second region the model of Colomer, et al. is in doubt because the value of their centreline velocity increases with distance away from the area source, which is in contrast to the present experimental results and contradicts to a decreasing velocity that one would expect on dimensional grounds.In the experimental study of thermal plumes in an enclosure, the spread of the plume vertical velocity radius was found to be wider than the plume temperature radius. The Gaussian equation also provided a good fit to the vertical velocity and temperature data in the far-field region. The modified Gaussian equation was used to fit the data in the near-field region. In the numerical study, it was found that the choice of the value of constants in the turbulence model had the effect on the results of simulation. For example, when the value of C&#949;3  and the value of turbulent Prandtl number (Prt) were set to 0.6 and 0.65, respectively the numerical results showed a good match with experimental results of both saline plumes and thermal plumes.Plumes from the &#8216;hot&#8217; processes such as metallurgical operations (e.g. foundries, furnace tapping, charging), are often generated from area sources and such plumes frequently do not reach a self-similar state due to the space over the &#8216;hot&#8217; processes is not high enough. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to determine plume characteristics, such as temperature or density distribution, velocity profile and plume width in the near-field region where the plume profiles are not self-similar.The results of this study provide new information on the fundamental behaviour of plumes from area sources and will assist in the improvement of the design procedures for industrial ventilation systems and other building ventilation system applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/445</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interchanging influences on the road: reflection on Jewish textiles</field><field name="creator">Price, Noa</field><field name="description">As a textile designer, my research examines designs and embellishments on the every day and sacred objects of Jewish migration.

I approach the topic of reason and absurdity as change processes in two ways. The first is through a conceptual discussion of reason and absurdity. My main argument is that reason is limited in the degree or type of change it can lead to whereas absurdity is better placed to lead to profound change. I also make the case that reason is normally based on persuasion, power and control whereas absurdity is a means of turning dominant paradigms and power inequities on their heads. My second approach is to use psychotherapy as a case study of personal change by first providing an overview of psychotherapy as a serious activity based on reason and then discussing ways in which absurdity, particularly as humour and paradox, can be an effective form of psychotherapy. I give many examples and case vignettes of these to demonstrate the potential of absurdity for fostering profound personal change. Since its inception in the late 19th century, modern psychotherapy has sat firmly within the science-reason paradigm. Exponents of the major psychotherapeutic orthodoxies &#8212; psychoanalysis, behaviourism, cognitive-behaviourism, and even humanistic psychology &#8212; have mostly couched their descriptions and guidelines in the language of science and rationality. Before the 1970s there was little reference in the professional literature to therapeutic humour and paradox and though interest in them has steadily increased since then it is still minimal whereas trivialisation and suspicion are common. Contemporary psychotherapeutic orthodoxy now also demands evidence-based practice; replicable, easy to teach techniques and outcomes; and accountability, with academic, professional and financial support now mostly dependent on these criteria. In contrast, since the 1970s there has been a proliferation of psychotherapies into the several hundreds. Many of these developed in reaction to a perception that reason-based talking therapy was limited. New themes became increasingly represented through concepts of human potential, liberation, spontaneity, self-actualisation, Eastern philosophies and spirituality. A new wave of therapies reflected alternative beliefs and practices to the dominant science-reason paradigm and emphasised direct experience and profound change rather than talking about experience and change as adaptation to social expectations. Where a person goes to therapy to make specific changes to behavioural or cognitive patterns, linear, reason-based, cognitive-behavioural techniques can be very effective. On the other hand, to produce profound or complex change, absurdity may be a better approach, bypassing habitual cognitive patterns, seeing the comic in the tragic, shocking the person into dramatically new ways of behaving and thinking. If this is so, absurdity should be seen as at least equal to reason and, in some cases, superior.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/716</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficacy of strategies to increase enrolment rates in disease management programs</field><field name="creator">Hoang, Christina</field><field name="description">Chronic diseases have been growing in prevalence in the twentieth century and several factors have contributed to the emergence of what is now described as an &#8220;epidemic&#8221; (Crews and Gerber, 1994). These factors include complex social, cultural and technological changes, which have exerted a significant impact on the health of the population and have become large contributors of illness, disability and premature mortality (Swinburn, Egger and Raza, 1999). Currently in Australia, an estimated three million people suffer from one or more chronic conditions with the most common being cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancers, diabetes, asthma and mental illnesses such as depression (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2004). Disease management programs were developed as a means of overcoming many of the burdens associated with the mounting chronic disease rate and this is primarily achieved by reducing the incidence of chronic diseases through prevention strategies, delaying the onset of disability, alleviating the severity of disease and prolonging the individual&#8217;s life (Brownson, Remington and Davis, 1998). However, participation rates in such programs are well below their desired level and often reported as being a particularly problematic and complex issue (for example: Foster, Kendall, Dickson, Chaboyer, Hunter and Gee, 2003). This study aimed to determine the most effective strategies for increasing participation rates in disease management programs using prospect theory (via message framing) and incentives. Members of a private health insurance company received, on a random basis, either a letter or phone call inviting them to join a health program. The letter or phone call contained a framed message: positive, negative or neutral. In addition, half the sample population was also offered a small incentive upon enrolment in the Total Health program, that is, a post-action incentive. The results of the study found no framing effects. Given the results, the use of tailoring should be examined as an alternative, and potentially more persuasive, means of communication. In relation to incentives, the use of a small gift or chance to enter a competition prize draw was found to be effective in influencing re-enrolment rates in two health programs. However, these same effects were not seen in relation to the use of a small monetary incentive. As a result, it is recommended that future studies test different types of incentives, both momentary and non-monetary, to determine the most optimum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/116</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is it that the application of modelling and simulation can contribute towards understanding and managing service quality data for internet service providers (ISP) in Australia?</field><field name="creator">Vilapakkam Nagarajan, Karthik</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the appropriateness and effectiveness of discrete event simulation technique to understand and manage service elements in the ISP (Internet Service Provider) context. The baseline for this research involved the secondary data published by ABS (Australian Bureau of Statistics) and TIO (Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman) involving ISP numbers, Internet issues/complaints data. As many relatively new services are being offered, ISPs are finding it difficult to cope with varying customer expectations and their future technology expectancy. Access to infrastructure, avoiding anti&#8212;competitive behaviour from large players and service differentiation has become more important than ever for their survival. A number of challenges such as lack of provision of good quality service, lack of ability to cope with increasing (or varying) customer demands and expectations and lack of flexibility in providing services need to be overcome. The service environment in networking has focused heavily on the technical side and very little attention has been given to functional variables such as complaints handling, aligning technical and functional service quality processes and effective service recovery during service failures. Relying fully on the technical side obscures the nature of service. This research identified the fact that end users&#8217; perspective of quality of services need to consider not only the inherent quality of the network, but also the service quality provided by the ISP. Users perceive poor service quality provided by their ISP if they do not get help desk support required from using the ISP services. This can turn a complaint about a problem in to a complaint about the company.  The research question is answered by this thesis &#8220;What is it that the use of discrete event simulation technique can contribute to the understanding and managing service quality data for different ISP service operations?&#8221;The research methodology chosen was discrete event simulation methodology. The discrete event technique involves building up models based on the dynamic behavior of a network system as the time progresses. The appropriateness and effectiveness of this technique was tested by modelling technical service elements (modelling policy based networks using differentiated service schemes, alarm based network management system for effective service level agreement monitoring) and key functional elements that determine ISP non-technical service performance (ISP complaints handling, ISP call centre performance variables). The scenarios led to the development of an integrative simulation framework that addresses both user level service quality issues and network system oriented service quality issues. In the past user level service quality issues have been provided with negligible importance. The framework developed can help ISPs to model service attributes and use the results from such simulation studies to make competitive marketing decisions. The issues raised before and after simulation can be compared for effective service design. To achieve service excellence ISPs have to understand the interrelationship between various service quality dimensions such as tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy and how these dimensions affect customer perception of ISP service quality. In conclusion the research found that discrete event simulation can be used to understand and manage service quality data by internet service providers involving different ISP service operations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/121</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Welding fume plume dispersion</field><field name="creator">Slater, Geoffrey Reginald</field><field name="description">The main concern with welding processes has in the past, generally, concentrated on productivity and quality. However, the occupational health of the welder has become a major focal area in the last decade, and the working environment of the welder is becoming a more important area of investigation. One particular area of interest is the amount of fume present in the operator&#8217;s breathing zone. With the potentially hazardous material present in the breathing environment of the welder, an effective method of controlling this airborne contaminant must be adopted to limit exposure levels to within occupational health and safety limits and to ensure the well being of the worker. This investigation examines the distribution of fume and breathing zone concentration within a controlled space using the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. The controlled working environment provided the basis for quantifying breathing zone exposure concentrations, and the ability to predict operator exposure.The initial evaluation focused on determining the breathing zone concentration and the welding fume plume dispersal within a confined enclosure. Within a sealed environment GMA welding was performed for approximate 100% duty cycle with two types (copper and non-copper coated) of ER-70S filler wire. The breathing zone and background enclosure concentrations were measured. The purpose of this initial investigation was to evaluate the breathing zone concentration within a confined environment, and to determine a fundamental concentration for direct evaluation of control procedures. The inclusion of the non-copper (low-fuming) coated electrode was to validate the measurements obtained during the study. The low-fuming electrode provided the expected reduction in exposure concentrations in comparison with the copper coated wire, however the concentrations measured over a 15 minute welding cycle were substantial higher than Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) exposure limits.To aid the evaluation of fume control effectiveness, various ventilation strategies were incorporated into the controlled environment. Utilising various modes of general and local extraction enabled an evaluation of the measured breathing zone concentration to be compared with the non-ventilated situation, as well as indicating their relationship with the occupational exposure limits for welding fume. This enabled the breathing zone exposure concentration to be effectively reduced to meet the OHS exposure limits. Although all techniques significantly reduced the exposure concentration, in direct comparison with the confined  &#8216;fundamental&#8217; concentrations, only an appropriately installed local extraction technique provided the required reduction.As well as the breathing zone evaluation, a model to predict the initial dispersion of GMAW fume was developed, aiding in better determining welding fume plume flow behaviour characteristics. This analysis, in addition with classical plume theories, enabled a model of the fume plume characteristics to be developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/384</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a poetics of hope: Simone Weil, Fanny Howe and Alice Walker</field><field name="creator">Howe, Christine</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to develop a poetics of hope based on the writings of Simone Weil, French mystic, philosopher and political activist. In L&#8217;Enracinement (The Need for Roots) Weil emphasizes the power of a living cultural heritage able to provide individuals with links to what she terms the &#8216;reality beyond the world&#8217;, or &#8216;absolute good&#8217;. These connections inspire a form of hope that can become a catalyst for actions characterized by love and, ultimately, play a role in the creation of more just societies. Central to this is Weil&#8217;s use of the Greek term metaxu, which describes things that act as mediators, or bridges, between the human and the divine. Certain forms of literature, according to Weil, have the potential to become metaxu. Two key themes emerge in this discussion &#8211; the significance of roots, both for the individual and his or her community &#8211; and Weil&#8217;s preference for present-oriented, rather than future-oriented hope. These themes provide the theoretical basis from which a poetics of hope begins to emerge.This poetics is then used to analyse the works of two contemporary American women writers, Fanny Howe and Alice Walker. Weil&#8217;s metaxu is able to illuminate the hope expressed in the two primary novels discussed, Howe&#8217;s Saving History and Walker&#8217;s The Color Purple. Although there are significant differences in Howe&#8217;s and Walker&#8217;s approaches to language, in the emphasis they each place on reclamation and renunciation of self, and in their conceptions of the divine, the hope expressed in both novels is revealed in acts of love that emerge as the characters focus their attention on different forms of metaxu. Integral to this discussion is the emphasis Weil, Howe and Walker place on cultivating an attitude of attentiveness towards others, towards the beauty of the world, and in the act of writing itself. Not only is this form of attention critical for the characters in Saving History and The Color Purple, the formal qualities of the texts themselves also require an attitude of attentiveness from the reader. As a result, these novels, in addition to revealing the role of metaxu in the lives of the characters, also have the potential to become metaxu in their own right. The poetics of hope developed in this thesis suggests that literature, as metaxu, has the potential to inspire a form of hope able to transform uprooted individuals and societies, and to build communities characterized by beauty, love and justice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/548</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Crunk', 'cracking' and 'choreographies': the place and meaning of health and physical activity in the lives of young people from culturally diverse urban neighborhoods</field><field name="creator">Atencio, Matthew</field><field name="description">As a number of writers have pointed out (Cole, 1996; Giardina, 2003; Kirk, 1999; McCarthy, Giardina, Harewood, &amp; Park, 2003; Rail, 1998, Silk &amp; Andrews, 2001), in Western societies individuals construct their plural and fluid subjectivities by engaging with broader cultural discourses existing in a &#8216;larger global frame of reference&#8217; (Giardina, 2003, p.66). From this perspective, this thesis explores the ways young people take up multiple subjectivities by translating and appropriating the &#8216;texts&#8217; of a multivalent global sport and &#8216;physical&#8217; culture in subversive, (re)productive, and conformist ways. The primary mode of analysis involved investigating how these &#8216;mobile subjectivities&#8217; (Rail, 1998, p. xv) reflected the young people&#8217;s specific class, gender, and cultural positionings, as well as their biographical histories and geographic backgrounds (Kirk, 1999).The study in this thesis simultaneously appropriated and critiqued several aspects of ethnographic research. Drawing from postcolonial and poststructural theoretical frameworks, qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews and observations were used to investigate the place and meaning of health and physical activity in the lives of young people from diverse &#8216;racial&#8217;, &#8216;ethnic&#8217;, and diasporic backgrounds. The young people&#8217;s use of their urban neighbourhood physical activity spaces was mapped and analyzed using methods informed by cultural geography. The analysis that was conducted paid specific attention to the unstable power relations inherent in the research interactions, and multiple and contradictory narratives were produced.Results of the study revealed that the young people came to exist as &#8216;healthy&#8217; subjects by engaging with physical culture discourses concerned with the maintenance, representation, and regulation of the body through dieting and exercise (Kirk, 1999). The young people made moral judgments about health through a cyclical association of appearance, attitude, and behavior. Healthiness was considered to be a desirable state of being that could be achieved through the adoption of specific eating and exercise practices. According to the young people, adherence to these practices could be read off the body. This belief was crystallized in their descriptions of &#8216;fat&#8217; people and &#8216;couch potatoes&#8217; who they considered to be lazy, unmotivated, and poor decision makers. However, in later comments the young people defined health in much more complex and contradictory ways, in relation to their gendered and racialized backgrounds. They eventually took up and contested the available health discourses in very diverse and subtle ways from each other and in comparison to their white counterparts found in other research studies.Another point of analysis was formulated to address the social impacts of space on the cultures of basketball and dancing. An examination of the young people&#8217;s spatial movements through their interview texts indicated that both institutional and &#8216;informal&#8217; basketball and dance spaces played a significant role in the promulgation of gendered and &#8216;racial&#8217; power relationships.In the park basketball courts, the young African-American men with the most talent and physical strength were able to exclude and constrain other young men and women from participating. In so doing, these young men were able to take up positions of power within social hierarchies that privileged and (re)produced their hegemonic &#8216;black&#8217; masculinities. The social practices which underpinned these unequal power relationships were linked with seductive &#8216;empowerment through sport&#8217; discourses operating in the young people&#8217;s impoverished urban neighborhoods.Analysis also revealed that the institutional dance spaces within the local high school (re)produced certain bodily practices which served to exclude and marginalize the &#8216;black&#8217; young women in my study. Particularly in the advanced dance classes and programs, social practices were (re)produced which   served to favor the &#8216;thin&#8217; white young women and their bodies. The &#8216;black&#8217; young women in my study were positioned as &#8216;hyper-sexual&#8217; and &#8216;sloppy&#8217;, and thus incapable, because of their devalued forms of &#8216;physical capital&#8217; (Bourdieu, 1984). Yet, these &#8216;black&#8217; young women were able to deploy unique performative acts through their bodies in order to recoup their deficit positioning as the &#8216;black&#8217; female &#8216;Other&#8217;. The diverse and complex ways that these young women used the dance spaces to refigure their subjectivities illustrates that gender and &#8216;race&#8217; are experienced differentially, and are not unifying and fixed categories.From these analyses I suggest that health, sport, and physical activity discourses aligned with power configurations in a variety of institutional, cultural, and geographic contexts profoundly shapes young people&#8217;s lives in psychic and corporeal ways. At the same time, young people constitute their multiple and fluid subjectivities by actively appropriating, (re)producing, and contesting these discourses in ways that serve to disrupt &#8216;normalizing&#8217; practices and knowledge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/554</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the usability of online grocery systems to improve customer satisfaction and uptake</field><field name="creator">Freeman, Mark Bruce</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the usability of Online Grocery Systems (OGSs) in order to improve both customer satisfaction and uptake.

Phase 1 was conducted using an expert review of 14 OGSs through heuristic evaluations and checklist/framework evaluations. Phase 2 was conducted using usability testing at one OGS that was deemed to be (based on the expert review in Phase 1) an OGS with good usability. The expert review was conducted by 54 participants with varying levels of online shopping experience. The results from the expert review (Phase 1) showed that the usability of the major Australian OGSs was comparable with those from other countries. The results from the usability testing (Phase 2) revealed usability issues with the OGS identified as having good usability, shown through the errors made by participants.The recording of errors in regards to the usability of systems has traditionally focused on safety-critical systems and business support systems. This study applies Zapf et al.&#8217;s &#8216;Taxonomy of Errors&#8217; to a non-work related context: the OGS. The taxonomy was found to show that similar types of errors were made by all users of such systems. However, the number of errors that were recorded by different user groups varied.

Although the Australian government advocates and actively promotes the formation of SME clusters, much academic commentary is dissatisfied with the theory on clusters, in particular its reliance on geographic proximity. The literature primarily addresses the benefits of industry clusters but overlooks the processes of how clusters are formed. This leaves some sections of the SME population underserved particularly those involved in horizontally integrated value chains. This thesis explores the formation process of a horizontal alliance and compares this to Rogers&#8217; innovation-diffusion theory. Through a case study of an Australian carpet buying group, SMEs were surveyed to collect data on the characteristics of buying group growth over a 13 year period. Our results show that the S-shaped innovation diffusion pattern of Rogers&#8217; theory accurately describes the growth of the buying group over this time. In particular, strong support was found for the opinion leadership theory. The use of Rogers&#8217; theory led to a better understanding of the role of networks and ICTs in promoting information sharing. In particular, the research finds that the dominant theory of geographical proximity advanced by Porter (1998a) needs to be qualified in relation to horizontally integrated value chains where SMEs share a high degree of homogeneity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/720</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical research into the metacapitalism efficiency in the Australian Telecommunications Industry</field><field name="creator">Xu, Geyi</field><field name="description">MetaCapitalism is publicly introduced by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in 2000 as a methodology that assists firms in becoming more efficient by means of decapitalisation, downsizing and innovation in value-added communities. However, can MetaCapitalism contribute to our understanding of market performance, especially in view of the current credit crisis? Hence, the Australian telecommunications sector is chosen for a primary test regarding the effects of MetaCapitalism on company&#8217;s market performance. The relevant data is collected from 1989 to 2007.  MetaCapitalism strategy is measured by six indices as the change of total assets (TA), property, plant and equipment (PP&amp;E), net working capital (NWC) the percentage of  PP&amp;E/TA, NWC/TA and (PP&amp;E+NWC)/TA from one period to the next. Share price is adopted as the market performance indicator underlining the efficient market paradigm.    The key findings show that the Australian telecom companies have been following the strategy since 1989 especially notable is that there are large scale decapitalisations during the year 2000. All six MetaCapitalism indices demonstrate frequent fluctuations during the 18-year period. Key conclusions are that even though decreasing PP&amp;E at certain level may have a positive impact on market performance especially for large scale companies, TA and NWC are of vital importance to telecom companies. Another important finding is that the empirical result proves the reflexivity of the stock market, where its cognitive function and manipulative function demonstrate different perceptions of the MetaCapitalism efficiency changes.

The inclusion of artworks by Aboriginal artists disrupted a linear European telling of history. The concept I developed for the second exhibition in 2006, EORA: Mapping Aboriginal Sydney, 1770-1850 was to identify and examine where possible the Aborigines dispossessed in those first years of settlement. This was a counterbalance to my family history and provided the opportunity to bring into the public arena the extraordinary scholarship of Keith Vincent Smith, the biographer of King Bungaree and Bennelong. The exhibition demonstrated how much information is now known about the Eora people and provided an opportunity for the Mitchell Library to showcase for the first time their colonial Indigenous material. While curatorially conservative, it was the most comprehensive exhibition of the subject matter ever assembled.In 2006 I also commenced my Masters of Arts by Research at the University of Wollongong in order to examine the third phase of my research: specific encounters between my family and Indigenous people. I started with Philip Gidley King, my maternal great-great-great-great-grandfather, as he was a First Fleeter as Second Lieutenant to Captain Arthur Phillip in 1788. Both these men experienced the first encounters with Aboriginal people in Botany Bay and their documentation has provided the official historical record, as the other better known and subsequently published journal writers arrived in Botany Bay several days after them. While I have other encounters to examine between my family and Indigenous people, the events of 1770 and 1788 are so fundamental as foundational narratives, that they have become the entire focus of this thesis.As my reading and written research progressed, the visual images I discovered, or were familiar with, became an indispensable element of the project. With my background as a curator and the variety of visual imagery available, an exhibition emerged as the most effective means of articulating my thesis. Lines in the Sand: Botany Bay Stories from 1770 also evolved into a quest to identify and articulate the Aboriginal perspective and voice, where possible, on the events of 1770 and 1788, and reflected the latest scholarship. The Aboriginal point of view has undoubtedly been best expressed by artists, particularly Gordon Bennett, and a younger generation such as Daniel Boyd and Jonathan Jones. Also incorporated again has been the most recent research of Keith Vincent Smith who has identified or verified several of the Aboriginal participants and eye witnesses of those first encounters. In 2006 I moved to Bundeena in the Sutherland Shire, and was subsequently invited to propose an exhibition for the Hazelhurst Regional Gallery and Arts Centre. As the southern shore of Botany Bay is part of the Sutherland Shire, an exhibition about the responses to the events of 1770 and 1788 in Botany Bay was the logical outcome. This provided the opportunity for me to present my ideas and research findings through a curatorial process that had been evolving over ten years. Rather than &#8220;conclusions&#8221;, my curatorial thesis illustrates how many different narratives contribute to a national narrative, and that there are many ways of interpreting and understanding history.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/805</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical and numerical modelling of soft clay foundation improvement via prefabricated vertical drains and vacuum preloading</field><field name="creator">Rujikiatkamjorn, Cholachat</field><field name="description">A system of vertical drains combined with vacuum preloading to accelerate soil consolidation by promoting radial flow is an affective method. In this thesis the analytical modelling of vertical drains incorporating vacuum preloading in an axisymmetric condition is proposed. The distribution of vacuum pressure along the drain and variations in volume compressibility, and permeability of soil based on large scale laboratory observations are included in the proposed solutions. These analytical predictions are compared with the experimental results using a large-scale consolidation chamber and agree with the measured data. In order to conduct a multi-drain, plane strain analysis using numerical modelling, the method of transforming permeability and vacuum pressure between axisymmetric and equivalent plane strain conditions are described through analytical and numerical schemes. After this a multi-drain, plane strain analysis is used to study 4 case histories taken from Thailand and China where the entire embankment was stabilised with vertical drains and subjected to vacuum preloading. This analysis employing the writer&#8217;s model indicates an improvement in the predictions in relation to the field observations. The data show that the efficiency of the prefabricated vertical drains depends on the magnitude and distribution of vacuum pressure, and the extent to which air is prevented from leaking.The design procedures for single stage and multi-stage construction proposed are based on the research knowledge learned from laboratory and field nvestigations. The length of vertical drain, anisotropic soil permeability and vacuum pressure are considered, and a reduction in consolidation time through vacuum preloading is compared to other available methods. Design charts are then developed using the equivalent drain diameter as an independent variable to obtain the relevant drain spacing, and eliminate cumbersome iterative procedures. The design methodologies and examples for single stage and multi-staged construction are also provided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/476</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of welding parameters on levels of diffusible hydrogen in weld metal deposited using gas shielded rutile flux cored wires</field><field name="creator">Pitrun, Miroslav</field><field name="description">Hydrogen assisted cold cracking (HACC) represents a significant threat to the integrity of welded steel constructions. HACC occurs at near ambient or lower temperatures and may be delayed for several hours, or even days, after welding is completed. Significant advances in developing thermomechanically controlled processed steels, with reduced carbon and alloy content, resulted in steels that are more resistant to HACC in the heat affected zone (HAZ). This has enabled the use of lower preheat temperatures during fabrication of welded structures. However, the improvement in the resistance of the HAZ to HACC has shifted the problem of cold cracking to the weld metal. The objective of this current work was to establish the effect of flux cored arc welding(FCAW) welding parameters, such as welding current, contact-tip toworkpiece distance (CTWD) and shielding gas type, on diffusible hydrogen (HD) content for single run, bead-onplate welds using low strength seamed and seamless gas shielded rutile wires of E71 T-1 classification. The work has shown that under most conditions investigated, the weld metal HD levels for the seamed rutile wire were above the 10 ml/100g specified by the consumable&#8217;s classification (H10). The measured range of diffusible hydrogen for the H10 wire was 8.3 to 17.0 ml/100g, with the highest hydrogen content being obtained at the lowest welding current of 280 A, shortest CTWD of 15 mm and deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas. In contrast, the seamless wire met requirements of the H5 classification (HD &#8804;5 ml/100g) for all welding conditions investigated, with a range of HD levels of 0.9 to 3.5 ml/100g. In general, lower HD levels were achieved when using CO2 shielding gas, although the effect is less significant with the H5 seamless rutile wire. The work included an investigation of arc characteristics under typical welding conditions, using high speed digital imaging and laser backlighting, in order to provide information on metal transfer and arc length. Several tests were carried out using the H10 consumable. It was established that the amount of heat generated by resistive heating of the wire prior to melting can exert a strong influence on the weld metal HD content and is more pronounced in welds deposited using 75Ar-25CO2. The measured arc length was reduced significantly when welding under CO2 shielding gas. Despite suggestions in the literature there was no evidence of a change in metal transfer mode to spray transfer on increasing the welding current from 280 to 320 A, transfer mode was globular for all conditions used. Following the weld metal diffusible hydrogen testing and welding arc imaging work, the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking was assessed using the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test at different preheat temperatures. For this part of the work, identical welding parameters those used for the diffusible hydrogen testing were selected. It was found that the H5 wire weld deposits did not reveal any cracking at ambient temperature, whereas all the welds deposited using the H10 wire exhibited cold cracking with no preheat. Weld metal deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas resulted in higher susceptibility to cold cracking than with CO2, which correlated to lower HD levels the CO2 tests. Besides the higher hydrogen content, it was also found that higher weld metal hardness corresponded to the greater crack susceptibility in the welds deposited using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas. These factors are considered to contribute to higher susceptibility to transverse cold cracking compared with CO2 shielding gas. Although the overall results indicate that the weld metal susceptibility to cold cracking corresponds to the relevant levels of HD, this relationship was found to be ambiguous in welds deposited at the shortest CTWD of 15 mm, using CO2 shielding gas at all welding currents investigated. While the amount of diffusible hydrogen was marginally increased from 11.7 to 12.8 ml/100g, resulting from the welding current increase from 280 to 320 A, the amount of cold cracking at room temperature was significantly decreased from 89 to 25 %RTC. This is explained by a significant difference in the cross section of the weld beads, suggesting a need to more closely evaluate the G-BOP testing, particularly examining the effects of weld bead profiles on the weld susceptibility to HACC. Preheat was found to decrease the amount of cold cracking in the H10 welds and it was concluded that preheat significantly reduces the main contributor to decrease the HD in the weld metal. Although the cracking susceptibility of welds using 75Ar-25CO2 shielding gas decreased more slowly with an increasing preheat temperature, compare to those deposited using CO2, no cracking was observed at 120 &#176;C in welds under both shielding gases. This indicates that the same welding consumable (H10) deposited using different shielding gases can result in a different response to preheat temperature. Based on the results of this work, a number of changes are proposed to hydrogen testing standards AS 3752-1996 and ISO 3690-2000, particularly with respect to the effects of CTWD and shielding gases on levels of diffusible hydrogen in weld metal deposited using gas shielded rutile flux-cored wire.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/361</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics and ecology of two rare grevillea species</field><field name="creator">Llorens, Tanya M</field><field name="description">Small and isolated plant populations have a higher probability of extinction &#8211; they are more susceptible to a range of environmental, demographic and genetic processes that may reduce population viability. In recent times, the number of populations and species that are susceptible to these processes has increased as a result of world-wide, human-induced habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation typically reduces the formerly more continuous natural distribution of a species to a series of smaller and more isolated populations that occur in smaller and more isolated habitat patches. Such populations are often exposed to a range of additional processes that may threaten their viability, such as changes to disturbance regimes, environmental conditions and interactions with other species. However, our current understanding of the complex effects and interactions of these processes is poor. Species responses vary widely, studies are biased towards trees, herbs and self-incompatible species, and most studies investigate only one or two processes that may affect viability. Consequently, we are unable to make accurate predictions about the likely impacts of habitat fragmentation on population and species viability. I tested several hypotheses about the impact of habitat fragmentation, small population size, and population isolation on populations of two Grevillea species (Proteaceae) that occur in the Sydney region of New South Wales, Australia. These species provided an opportunity to investigate some of the ecological and genetic consequences of small population size and isolation, and to contrast them between a species for which the small size and isolation of its populations is the natural state (G. longifolia) and one for which it arose recently due to severe habitat fragmentation (G. caleyi). This comparative approach is important in identifying the processes involved in reducing population and species viability. The species share many aspects of their biology and ecology. Both are large, perennial shrubs that are self-compatible and naturally bird-pollinated. They are fire-sensitive and regenerate post-fire by mass germination from a long-lived, soil-stored seed bank. Both species consist of populations that vary dramatically in size and degree of isolation. I used microsatellite and AFLP markers to investigate aspects of the population genetics and mating system of these species, with the primary focus on G. caleyi. Both species showed a surprisingly large amount of genetic structuring among populations, although G. caleyi populations showed more structuring (FST = 0.46) than those of G. longifolia (FST = 0.33), despite being distributed over a much smaller area. In addition, for G. caleyi, most (63%) of the structuring was due to differences among recently-fragmented populations. By examining fine scale genetic structure within existing large populations, I determined that this was probably due to historic genetic structuring within formerly larger, more continuous populations. This has probably arisen due to both a lack of gene flow (no seed dispersal and limited pollen dispersal) and a large amount of inbreeding. Indeed, adult fixation indices were very high in G. caleyi (average f = 0.40, f &gt; 0 in 16/18 populations). For both species, genetic diversity was not strongly correlated with population size. Genetic diversity was significantly lower in more isolated populations of G. caleyi, but this was probably due to a historic lack of gene flow to the more isolated parts of the species&#8217; natural range, rather than to recent fragmentation. Levels of inbreeding (fixation indices) among adult plants did not vary with population size or isolation for either species. However, by genotyping fresh seeds from a range of small and large G. caleyi populations, I revealed that current outcrossing rates were much lower in small populations (t = 0.18 cf. 0.37). Observations of pollinator foraging indicated that this might be due to a very low visitation rate by birds and by a less diverse suite of species, resulting in a higher proportion of self-fertilisation. In contrast, even very small G. longifolia populations received many bird visits. In addition, G. caleyi plants in small populations were much smaller, had higher mortality, and produced fewer inflorescences and fruits, while this pattern was not apparent among G. longifolia populations. The contrast among the species in pollinator visits, plant vigour and reproduction may have been due to edge effects combined with the habitat degradation that was apparent at sites containing small G. caleyi populations. Small populations were typically found within very small and disturbed bush remnants, while small G. longifolia populations all occurred in relatively pristine habitat. Therefore, habitat quality rather than population size per se may be the most important factor that determines the mating system, plant vigour and fecundity in G. caleyi. The lack of obvious impacts of habitat fragmentation on the genetic  haracteristics of adult G. caleyi plants may have been due to the soil-stored seed bank, which can contain seeds produced by at least two adult generations. Various authors have hypothesised that a persistent seed bank has the potential to reduce the rate of genetic change in a population. The seed banks of both G. caleyi and G. longifolia do appear to have this ability. I found that the seed bank of each species maintains the genetic characteristics of populations and stores genetic diversity and alleles that were not expressed in the extant adult plants. Nevertheless, the seed bank also showed greater spatial structuring than adults, which indicates that genetic changes may be occurring within these small populations despite the buffering power of the seed bank. Finally, I investigated some aspects of the ecology of G. caleyi and G. longifolia seed banks, with the aim of increasing our understanding of this important conservation resource. Soil sieving revealed that the seeds of both pecies occur at very low densities beneath adult plants (1 &#8211; 6 m-2), were vastly outnumbered by seed fragments, and were not found away from adult canopies. This supports previous evidence that indicated a lack of seed dispersal and very high rates of post-dispersal seed predation, which will restrict population size and extent. To some degree, the seed bank may buffer demographic changes that affected the previous adult generation &#8211; monitoring of post-fire seedling emergence revealed that population size typically increased, often dramatically, after a fire. Germination experiments showed that smoke elicited the greatest germination response from intact seeds of both species, and that dormancy polymorphism in the seed bank may allow both species to survive two fires in rapid succession and long inter-fire intervals. However, germination was low in field fire experiments, which may have been due to low fire intensity, and hence smoke production, resulting from a winter prescription burn. For both species,  herefore, population viability may be compromised if the imposed fire regime includes fires that are too cool or too frequent. This study has demonstrated, for these species, that small populations that exist in recently fragmented habitat patches are far more likely to experience adverse ecological and genetic effects than those in continuous, relatively undisturbed, bushland. The process of demographic and genetic decline in small G. caleyi populations is likely to continue with the ongoing pressures of edge effects, habitat degradation and pollinator declines, and the increased isolation of some populations. The seed bank may buffer these declines to some extent, but this ability is limited by a lack of habitat for population expansion, which means that effective population sizes will remain very small or decrease further. The various differences detected between small and large G. caleyi populations emphasises the importance of large populations, and the ecological processes occurring within larger habitat patches, for the long-term conservation of the species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/374</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the adequacy of the Philippine legal, policy, and institutional framework to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing</field><field name="creator">Palma, Mary A</field><field name="description">Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a global fishing concern considered as one of the obstacles in achieving sustainable fisheries. In the Philippines, IUU fishing is known to undermine national efforts related to the conservation and management of fisheries resources. International fisheries instruments, particularly the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU), recognises the increasing concern on IUU fishing and calls on States to adopt measures that would effectively address the problem.This thesis examines the adequacy of the Philippine legal, policy, and institutional framework to combat IUU fishing. It analyses the definition of IUU fishing provided under the IPOA-IUU and assesses how such definition applies within the Philippine context. The measures adopted in international fisheries instruments to address the problem are also examined. From the analysis, three sets of criteria are formulated to measure the adequacy of the Philippine framework to combat IUU fishing. The first set of criteria involve the application of flag and coastal State measures; the second relate to the application of port and market-related measures; while the third entail the adoption of &#8220;all State&#8221; responsibilities.It is concluded that by failing to satisfy most of the criteria established under international fisheries instruments, the Philippines renders its legal, policy, and institutional framework inadequate to address IUU fishing. The major areas of inadequacy relate to the Philippine definition of IUU fishing, the measures adopted by the State to address the problem, and the corresponding institutional framework for fisheries management. The thesis also provides specific options for legislative and policy reforms that would address the gaps in the current national framework in order to effectively prevent, deter, and eliminate IUU fishing in the Philippines.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/589</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual study on perceptions of information seeking activity</field><field name="creator">Meloche, Joseph A.</field><field name="description">The evolution of information and communication technologies have heightened our awareness of information in our lives and emphasised the significance of our information seeking activities. This study proposes that the conceptualisation of information seeking, is and has been, metaphorically based in its many manifestations. The study approaches this topic by examining the understandings that active information seekers (and information professionals and educators) have of the activity of information seeking. The study also examines their understandings of the related terms information and information technology. Thus this study establishes the nature of these understandings through an examination of choices that the participants make in expressing their understandings. These are brought together through the use of metaphor into emergent categories. These ways of seeing are used as conceptual lenses to explore information seeking activity.The first part of this research establishes how information-seeking adults conceptualise information and information seeking in the early stages of their educational development. To accomplish this it examines literature on metaphor and pays attention to how participants describe their experience of information and information seeking. It goes on to determine if the metaphors or descriptions differ among various groups of information seekers and establishes if particular metaphors or descriptions are associated with particular perceptions. To accomplish this it is deemed essential to establish the particular understandings that information seekers use to explain their conceptualisations of information, information technology and information seeking. The expressed understandings are reviewed as they relate to the formation of meanings.The findings of this research are that most people see Information Seeking as a learning activity. This is significant, as the view of Information Seeking as Learning gives it a depth that could never be achieved by the traditional &#8220;bucket and brick&#8221;metaphor. Learning is much closer to the &#8220;gap filling&#8221; metaphor, but it is still something more. The statements on which participants placed most importance in the Q-sort show that Information Seeking as a learning activity is challenging, satisfying curiosity and ultimately individual. Thus designing technological tools to support Information Seeking Activity should take heed of the different perceptions of what this may mean as determined in this research.This is achieved initially by a review of relevant literature and subsequently through the use of a research methodology that allows information seekers to state how they understand information, information technology and information seeking. Q Methodology is used as the primary form of study. Activity Theory is also used to frame the analysis and discussion of the results. The integrated application of concepts and techniques of metaphor, Q-method and Activity Theory make the methodology used in this research as innovative and meaningful as the findings themselves.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/592</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Harming and healing : young women and the development of the autonomous self</field><field name="creator">Kyle, Renee L</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the behaviour known as deliberate self-harm in young women who are victims of parental incest. I am interested in identifying the impact and significance of incest in childhood on the development of young women&#8217;s agency and the significance of self-harming behaviour in that development. I argue that central to understanding the relationship between self-harm and incest is the notion of the self and the social and relational context in which it develops. The theoretical framework I employ to explain the development of self draws upon work in developmental psychology and feminist philosophical discourse on selfhood. My examination of the relationship between deliberate self-harm and incest explores the interaction between the three facets of an incestuous relationship: the sexual abuse of a child by her parent. The analysis of this interaction begins by articulating the significance of the relationship between parent and child on the child&#8217;s development. I contend that when a parent sexually abuses his child, he threatens his child&#8217;s attachment to him. Because this connection is integral to her psychological development, the child will try to remain in relationship with her parent despite his abuse of her, and will therefore develop complex, and sometimes contradictory, responses to the harm of incest that protect this attachment. I argue that deliberate self-harm should be understood in part as an attempt to remain connected to her abusive parent because of the importance of this relationship to the child&#8217;s developing sense of selfhood.To further illuminate the implications of incest on self-development, I articulate some of the psychological impacts of shame as it operates within an oppressive relationship such as parental incest involving a child. I attempt to show that the shame engendered by incest communicates to the child that she is an inferior and an inadequate moral agent, an agent unworthy of being treated respectfully by others. Because she is developmentally vulnerable, this shame profoundly shapes her understanding of herself, her responsibility and her agency.In light of such disturbances to the child&#8217;s sense of self, I critically analyse the popular conception of deliberate self-harm as primarily a coping strategy used to deal with the effects of sexual trauma. I argue that this is not the best way to understand, and respond to, the behaviour. I contend that current coping theory does not adequately attend to the influence of development or context upon an individual&#8217;s coping style, and because the selfhood of a victim of incest develops within an oppressive context, coping theory cannot significantly advance our understanding of the behaviour, not the development of appropriate clinical responses or treatment. The examination of the relationship between deliberate self-harm and incest is advanced by a consideration of the interplay between oppressive socialisation and personal autonomy. Drawing on the significance of relationships, trust and selfregard in the development of a child&#8217;s selfhood and autonomy, I show how the development of the skills of autonomy is compromised by the experience of incestuous abuse. I maintain that the behaviour of self-harm is indicative of such compromise in her skills.Given my argument that adopting a developmental approach to selfhood is conducive to reaching a better understanding of deliberate self-harm, I move to an analysis of the adequacy of the typical clinical response to young women who selfharm. I argue that the diagnostic tool of the clinical community constrains clinicians&#8217; ability to adopt a developmental approach when treating those who self-harm, and as such, is likely to lead to an inappropriate clinical response. I conclude with some suggestions as to how a clinician may, informed by the argument concerning the development of relational autonomy and selfhood developed here, more ethically engage with young women who self-harm.This thesis demonstrates that adopting a developmental, relational approach is conducive to better understanding self-harm in young women who are victims of incest. Such an approach illuminates the significance of relationships in the development of selfhood, which in turn better positions the clinician to address the issues which underlie her behaviour.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/599</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disclosing childhood sexual assault in close relationships : the meanings and emotions women associate with their experiences and their lives now</field><field name="creator">Maitland, Hilary Anne</field><field name="description">This research aimed to explore women&#8217;s meanings and emotions associated withdisclosing childhood sexual assault within close relationships and their current life experiences. A personal construct model of the disclosure process was examined, which proposed that disclosing childhood sexual assault will impact on women&#8217;s meaning making, their willingness to tell, and their close relationships.Participants were twenty eight women between 20 and 60 years of age drawnfrom those accessing counselling or support groups. Twenty three women completed a questionnaire, provided narratives about their current life experiences and an importantdisclosure experience, and the Social Support Questionnaire (Sarason, Levine, Basham and Sarason, 1983). Eight women from a Survivors Support Group participated in a discussion about their disclosure experiences.Meanings women associated with their disclosure and current life experienceswere identified in individual narratives and the Support Group transcript. The emotional content of women&#8217;s narratives was examined using a qualitative approach and the content analysis scales of Anxiety, Hostility Directed Outward, Hostility Directed Inward, Ambivalent Hostility, Depression, Hope and Human Relations (Gottschalk and Bechtel, 2002), Positive Affect and Sociality (Viney, Caputi and Webster, 2000).Women&#8217;s recollections of their disclosure experiences and current life experiences contained meanings about self, others, self in relation to others and childhood sexual assault (supporting Hypothesis 1), evidence of invalidation, validationand reconstruction (supporting Hypothesis 2), and evidence of both negative andpositive emotions (anger, hostility, anxiety, fear, mixed emotions, guilt, shame, sadness/depression, love, pleasant emotions, and relief) supporting Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 4 proposing a relationship between the meanings women gave to their experiences and their emotions was also supported. Hypothesis 5 proposing a positivecorrelation between women&#8217;s views of their current social networks and the emotions they experience was supported for positive emotions (these were positively associated with satisfying close relationships) but not for negative emotions.The implications of the research findings for both clinical practice and the widercommunity were explored. The application of the model to the broader community of people sexually assaulted as children was examined.

Since the 1980s, development along the Coral Coast has occurred at a rate never previously seen in this area. Large resorts and smaller backpacker facilities emerged from the once coconut-tree lined coastal stretch, from Serua, to Natadola. Village populations have also increased. Anecdotal information and the few, sporadic studies conducted in this area have indicated that the water quality and the biological communities on the fringing reefs have deteriorated dramatically since the 1980s. Live corals which used to feature prominently on the fringing reefs (hence the name &#8216;Coral Coast), have been replaced by weedy macroalgae, the most common of which is the brown algae Sargassum. The Coral Coast fringing reefs were apparently undergoing phase shifts (like other reefs around the world), and anthropogenic factors have been blamed. The need for scientific information on the effects of anthropogenic activities on the Coral Coast water quality and fringing reef communities prompted this study. The study had several objectives. Two major components addressed the need to establish baseline scientific information on the variability of dissolved nutrients in the water column, and the status of biological communities on the reef flats of the fringing reefs, for control sites (away from human impacts), and impacted sites (close to villages and resorts).  Nutrients from anthropogenic sources on land have been identified as one the major bottom-up controlling factors for phase shifts on coral reefs. Control, village and resort sites were monitored for nutrient concentrations from 2003 &#8211; 2006, and sampling times covered seasonal as well as weather effects, particularly the effects of storm-associated rainfall. Benthic surveys were also carried out in control and impacted sites several times over the period 2004 &#8211; 2006. To complement the results from the longer term monitoring of water quality and reef benthic communities, a number of short-term, targeted experiments were conducted in the laboratory and in the field, to examine nutrient uptake by algae, herbivory impacts and nutrient sources. A combination of the Line Transect and Quadrat Point Intercept methods were used for the assessment of the abundances and distribution of the main species on the fringing reefs, especially Sargassum sp. Nutrient enrichment experiments were conducted in the laboratory and also in the field to assess uptake of nutrients by Sargassum sp.  Herbivore-exclusion caging experiments were conducted in the field to assess influence of herbivory in a &#8216;tabu&#8217; or marine protected area (MPA) as well, as in non-&#8216;tabu&#8217; or open-fishing sites. Samples of Sargassum sp. and a few other dominant macroalgae species from the study sites were analysed for tissue nitrogen and phosphorus contents and for &#61540;15N content, to aid nutrient source identification.Nutrient concentrations were highly variable, showed little association with season, but were strongly linked to rainfall. The results indicated the clear influence of pulse (storm runoff related) events on the nutrient concentrations in the water column. Control sites generally recorded lower nutrient concentrations than impacted sites, confirming the anthropogenic effects on water column nutrients. The biological communities on the fringing reefs reflected the status of nutrients in the water column, i.e., reefs close to human impacts recorded higher abundances of macroalgae, especially Sargassum sp., and lower abundances of live corals.  The nutrient enrichment experiments showed the ability of Sargassum sp. to take up nutrients very quickly from the water column, but the rhizoids showed greater responses than the leafy shoots used in the experiments. The &#8216;low growth&#8217; season for Sargassum sp. during the Cool season (May to October) may be the explanation for the differential responses between the rhizoids, and the leafy parts of the Sargassum plants used in the experiment. Caging experiments showed the significance of herbivory in the control of Sargassum sp., and the &#8216;tabu&#8217; sites appeared to show a greater intensity of herbivory (lower suvivorship for uncaged shoots). Both tissue nutrient and &#61540;15N contents in macroalgae samples matched the findings from the water column nutrient studies, i.e., the human-impacted sites exhibited nutrient enrichment in the water column and in the macroalgae on the reef flats. Sargassum samples from impacted sites had higher tissue % N and higher &#61540;15N contents compared to the control sites confirming that human activities were enriching the coastal waters with nutrients. On the basis of the results from this research, recommendations are proposed for better management of nutrient sources on land for the protection of the water quality, and therefore promote healthier coral reef systems. The significance of protecting herbivorous species is also important, and the setting aside of &#8216;tabu&#8217; sites is encouraged. Areas of further research are also identified, for better understanding of the interrelationships among all the factors involved in the phase shift occurring on the fringing reefs along the Coral Coast of south-western Viti Levu, Fiji.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/83</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opportunity lost: NSW regional theatre companies 1976 to 2003</field><field name="creator">Davis, Desmond</field><field name="description">From 1976 to 1980 six professional theatre companies were established in NSW outside the capital city Sydney. They were titled Regional Theatre Companies after similar entities in Britain. They grew and flourished into the early 1990s. Then one by one, almost at the height of their activity they began to fail. By 2006 there was only one fully professional regional theatre company operating in NSW.This is the phenomenon which is the subject of this thesis. What distinguished these companies as a group, what did they contribute to regional and national life, how did they arise, what did they achieve and why and how did they decline? The overarching question is of their significance in Australian cultural life and the significance of their failure. Was it an &#8220;opportunity lost&#8221;? These questions have not been systematically addressed in any study and the purpose of this thesis in addressing these issues is to contribute to and invigorate the public debate on the nature of the national theatre enterprise. The six companies for examination are Hunter Valley Theatre Company in Newcastle, Q Theatre in Penrith, Riverina Theatre Company in Wagga Wagga, New England Theatre Company in Armidale, Murray River Performing Group (MRPG) in Albury/Wodonga and Theatre South in Wollongong.  The researcher himself was a participant observer in this story as co-founder and Artistic Director of one of the companies. The methodology for the study is therefore an interpretive and reflexive one. Qualitative, interpretive and reflexive research allows for complexities and enables the researcher to explore multiple possibilities and to place him or herself more visibly in the story, aiming always for interpretation rather than the representation of the apparent reality.Pierre Bourdieu defined theory as a temporary construct which takes shape for and by empirical work. Bourdieu&#8217;s own theories provide an appropriate theoretical framework for this study. Regional Theatre Companies are studied as a distinct agent or sub-field within the larger Field of Cultural Production. Competition of agents within a field is an invariant property of Bourdieu&#8217;s Fields and will determine the dominant and dominated classes within the field. The competition within the Field of Cultural Production is for cultural capital, which in turn will determine who can impose the legitimate definition of art in each particular position including theatre. The dominant class so determined will achieve a position, albeit a dominated one, within the Field of Power in which the struggle is for political and economic capital. The thesis will demonstrate how the major performance companies became the dominant agents in the Field of Cultural Production. This competition for cultural capital takes place in what the thesis identifies as sites of struggle. Among these most relevant for regional theatre are excellence versus access, mainstream versus alternative, elite versus popular, metropolitan versus regional, and global/national versus local/community. The dominant class will be in the former of these dichotomies and the regional theatre companies will be found in the latter.There are two visions of an Australian national theatre: one is a vision of an infrastructure of companies in city and country creating a body of work reflecting and expressing the pluralist identity of Australian culture; the other is a vision of major enterprises in major cities creating work of &#8220;excellence&#8221; and presenting an image of Australian cultural life internationally. The regional theatre companies of NSW had the capacity to be a significant part of the former vision.They found new audience for the theatre, and they found it not only with the traditional repertoire but also with work that was especially relevant for the diverse strands of the regional population, and still further with work which expressed, validated, celebrated and constructed a regional cultural identity. Their work was presented in a style and an environment suited to the nature of their audience and justifiably described as popular. They made mistakes, and often floundered and lost direction, and it would be an exaggeration to claim that they consciously pursued or completely achieved these objectives. Their story is not of an undeniable achievement but of an opportunity lost.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/84</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermoregulation in people with spinal cord injury</field><field name="creator">Wilsmore, Bradley R</field><field name="description">Thermoafferent information is integrated at multiple levels within the central nervous system. However, due to the difficulty in differentiating thermoregulatory functions of the spinal cord from those of higher centres in humans, the role of the spinal cord in certain aspects of thermoregulation remains unclear. Subjects with spinal cord injury have unique neural changes providing an opportunity to evaluate the role of the spinal cord, independently of higher thermoregulatory centres. Subjects with (N=11) and without (N=11) spinal cord injury were studied in a series of experiments, in which a wide range of local and whole-body temperature changes and postural manipulations were imposed. During these trials, various physiological (skin temperature, core temperature, local sweat rate and sweat expulsion frequency - a measure of central sympathetic drive), and psychophysical variables (thermal sensation and discomfort) were investigated. Six key observations arose from these experiments: (i) Subjects with spinal cord injury had a lower thermoafferent capacity (secondary to neural damage) and a corresponding reduction in thermoefferent drive (sudomotor sensitivity of 4.2 versus 8.8 expulsions&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#61616;C-1 in able-bodied; P=0.03). (ii) Equations used to approximate thermoafferent drive in able-bodied subjects, overestimated thermal feedback in subjects with spinal cord injury. However, this could be corrected by modifying the skin area weightings to include only the sensate areas. (iii) No subjects with physiologically-confirmed thermoefferent spinal cord injury displayed sweating from insensate skin sites, indicating that a spinal cord that has been isolated from higher centres cannot induce thermal sweating. (iv) Subjects with spinal cord injury had higher forehead sweat rates (0.77 versus 0.52 mg&#8226;cm-2&#8226;min-1; P=0.03), but an equivalent sweat sensitivity (1.24 versus 1.27 mg&#8226;cm-2&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#176;C-1; P=0.94), indicating the presence of a peripheral adaptation to sustain thermal homeostasis, and secondary to reduced thermal afferent and efferent flow. (v) Respiratory frequency increased more for a given increase in body temperature in subjects with spinal cord injury (2.4 versus 1.1 breaths&#8226;min-1&#8226;&#176;C-1; P=0.042), but this did not provide a thermoregulatory benefit. (vi) Subjects with spinal cord injury demonstrated greater changes in behavioural thermoregulatory indicators (thermal sensation and discomfort) in response to standardised local and whole-body thermal loads. Collectively, these observations indicate the unique nature of thermoregulation in people with spinal cord injury and the adaptive ability of the human thermoregulatory system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/85</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">National policy choices for an international problem: case studies in greenhouse policy</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Geoffrey</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the choices governments make for their policy instruments in the context of a single national problem &#8211; climate change. Taking into account the context in which such decisions are made, the thesis seeks to identify the broader motivations influencing governments in their policy development and implementation. It considers also the implicit constraints on instrument choice and application arising from that context. A knowledge of such motivations and constraints is important for what it implies about the prospects for structured international cooperation requiring specific domestic actions, as is the case in climate change. Various theoretical frameworks exist which seek to explain why governments may act in a particular manner. No one of these could be said to dominate others, or to be uniquely applicable in any given situation. This thesis seeks to contribute to the understanding of government motivations by analysing the actions taken by five national governments &#8211; Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia - in pursuit of a common objective, over the period 1990 &#8211; 2004. The policy goal considered is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for the purpose of mitigating global climate change. Using a case study approach, it examines the national and international context in which the various governments developed and implemented their national actions in pursuit of that policy goal. Further, it analyses the policy instruments governments adopted for the purpose, developing a numerical assessment of the reliance placed on instruments of different type, and the results achieved in their application. Taking account of the various explanatory frameworks, both the policy-making context and the observed policy actions are used to analyse the principal influences and motivations which have led to the outcome observed in each case. In addition to inferences of likely government motivations, the individual national case studies provide both an examination of real policy instruments in use, and measures of the reliance placed on different instrument types, and their effectiveness. In three of the cases, the dominant motivation inferred for government actions was that of the pursuit of the public interest, albeit markedly differing from textbook definitions of the &#8220;public interest&#8221;. In the remaining two studies, institutional constraints were seen to be the major determinants of outcomes, with those institutional constraints underpinned in the one case by public interest considerations, and in the other by public choice influences. The cases also demonstrated the higher degree of policy effectiveness associated with the more coercive instruments such as regulation.The cross-border commonality of the policy issue studied here made possible the examination of results from individual cases from a cross-case perspective. Further aspects were evident from that, notably the influence of international relationships on domestic policy-making, and the limited role played by environmental advocacy groups in influencing policy implementation. The case studies showed that the only country where environmental pressure group representation could be seen as significant was in Germany, where representation took place through formal political participation, and the leverage so gained. The principal objective of this thesis has been to throw light on the motivations of and influences on government in policy-making and implementation. In addition however, the research approach adopted has provided insights into the very real issues faced by national governments seeking to counter a problem of the nature of greenhouse gas emission reduction. These issues, and the means by which different governments have sought to address them, are central determinants of the likely success or failure of attempts at coordinated international action in one of the most critical current challenges, that of global climate change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/86</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimation for state space models: quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches</field><field name="creator">Al zghool, Raed Ahmad Hasan</field><field name="description">In this thesis, parameter estimation for multivariate heteroscedastic models with unspecified correlations is considered. Two alternative approaches for estimating the state variables and unknown parameters in non-linear and non-Gaussian state space models with unspecified correlations are developed; these are the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood methods.Quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches have been found to be useful in parameter estimation, especially when the underlying system dynamic probability distribution cannot be fully specified. The quasi-likelihood method relaxes the distributional assumptions and only assumes knowledge of the first two conditional moments. A limitation of quasi-likelihood is that the nature of the conditional covariance matrix is not always known. An alternative approach, asymptotic quasi-likelihood is described. Semiparametric treatment is considered in this thesis. It involves a nonparametric kernel approach to estimating the unknown covariance matrix and it integrates the estimation of the covariance matrix with the standard quasi-likelihood approach.Applications of the quasi likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches to state space models are demonstrated via simulation studies. One simulation study based on the Poisson model and another based on the basic stochastic volatility model are presented. Results from these simulation studies show that the performance of the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood approaches are comparable to other methods, with no knowledge required of the underlying system&#8217;s probability structure.Sensitivity of the quasi-likelihood and asymptotic quasi-likelihood estimation procedures to initial values assigned to state variables and starting parameters is investigated. A suggestion on choosing the initial value of state variables, without knowing the system&#8217;s probability structure is given. Standard steps used to improve the grid search method for obtaining better estimation of unknown parameters, in nonlinear and non-Gaussian state space models, are established.Finally techniques developed in this thesis are applied to real data. Three datasets are considered: (i) the daily exchange rate of US Dollar/Australian Dollar and British Pound/Australian Dollar for the period from 1/1/2003 to 1/1/2006; (ii) the monthly number of cases of poliomyelitis reported by the U.S. Center for Disease Control for the years 1970 to 1983 and (iii) the exchange rates of Pound/Dollar from 1/10/81 to 28/6/85. Results, including residual analysis for the various modelling approaches, demonstrate that techniques developed in this thesis are applicable and have advantages when compared with other technical approaches.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/91</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of estimation methods for generalized linear mixed models</field><field name="creator">Collins, Damian</field><field name="description">Generalised linear models (GLMs) are a flexible class of non-linear models for non-normally distributed response data. GLMs encompass models for discrete response data which takes one of several values rather than being measured on a continuous scale. Discrete response data is abundant in agricultural and biological research, for instance, in the mortality of animals and plants (binary/binomial data) and the scoring of disease (ordinal data).Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) are an extension of GLMs which include additional random effects in the (conditional) linear predictor. Some examples of where GLMMs may be useful include the analysis of designed experiments, surveys, spatial data and longitudinal or repeated measures data.The fundamental difficulty in using GLMMs is that no closed analytical expression for the likelihood is available. A variety of approaches have been proposed to circumvent this difficulty, including approximate likelihood approaches, such as penalized quasi-likelihood (PQL), numerical approaches, such as Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ), and approaches based on the use of Monte Carlo methods, such as modern Bayesian approaches implementing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.Although in recent years more attention in the literature has been given to Bayesian approaches and other approaches based on Monte Carlo techniques for GLMMs, there is still widespread interest amongst practitioners in the use of approximate likelihood approaches, especially with the work of Lee &amp; Nelder (2001, 2006). The objective of this PhD is primarily to explore the approximate likelihood approaches, as well as comparing and contrasting them with numerical and Monte Carlo approaches.The most widely known approximate likelihood approach, PQL, is well-known to give biased estimators of the GLMM parameters for binary grouped data when the group size is small. However, the other two groups of approaches for GLMMs are not without problems. Numerical approaches such as GHQ are only suitable for GLMMs with nested random effects only, and often require very good starting values to achieve convergence. Approaches based on Monte Carlo techniques can be very computational intensive and also have convergence problems, as well as being sensitive to the choice of priors, when used within the Bayesian paradigm. The approximate likelihood approach of Lee and Nelder is claimed, by its proponents, to enjoy the computational efficiency of PQL whilst not suffering from the estimation bias issues that PQL experiences.A background to the GLMM and inferential issues is provided in Chapter 1, with theoretical material and alternative approaches for modelling correlation in non-normal data, such as the generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. It is argued that the GLMM is the most generally applicable model for modelling correlation and clustering in non-normal data available at present. The second chapter reviews the main estimation approaches for GLMMs, discussing in more detail the issues associated with each of the approaches already highlighted above.Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the two most popular approximate likelihood approaches, PQL and the hierarchical GLM (HGLM) approach of Lee &amp; Nelder (2001, 2006) respectively. Simulation studies are presented in Chapter 3 for binary and sparse Poisson data from a range of designs. These studies show that the two main factors associated with estimation biases are the group sizes and the relative magnitude of the variance components (as well as the sparcity of the Poisson data). These studies also suggest that hypothesis testing for fixed effects, against the usual null hypothesis of zero effect, can be reliably conducted using Wald tests using the estimated variance-covariance matrix of the fixed effects from PQL. Finally, they also indicate that the first order Laplace approximation may be useful for calculating approximate likelihood ratio tests for testing variance components. Chapter 4 contains discussion of the HGLM approach of Lee and Nelder, which relies on either a first or second order approximation of the likelihood. Computational issues associated with the use of the HGLM approach are discussed in the context of a Fortran 90 implementation. Further simulation studies show that estimation biases for HGLM approaches are generally much smaller in magnitude than PQL, but the HGLM estimators can also be unstable for binary models with conditional expectations near 0 or 1. Some heuristic arguments for the relative performance of the HGLM approaches versus PQL are also presented.Estimation biases for the PQL and the HGLMapproaches are compared with Bayesian and GHQ approaches in Chapter 5 using a series of case studies. The approximate likelihood approaches performed reasonably well against Bayesian and GHQ approaches for all case studies presented, with the exception of the Rodriguez &amp; Goldman (2001) datasets, with no finite maximum for the likelihood found using the (second order) HGLM approaches. The second order HGLM approach gave similar estimates to the Bayesian and GHQ approaches in a paired binary simulation study.  Despite greater estimation biases, the PQL estimators had lower MSE than the GHQ estimators in a second paired binary (and Poisson) simulation study, in which the Bayesian estimator, with default priors, suffered estimation bias as well. PQL also performed relatively well against other approaches in a simulation study involving a randomised complete block design (RCBD) and in a simulation study involving a spatial GLMM, where PQL was compared with a much more computationally intensive Bayesian approach. These simulations also showed that the &#8220;REML-like&#8221; correction to the likelihood used by the HGLM and Bayesian approaches can give some positive estimation bias.Whilst both approximate likelihood approaches had difficulties either in terms of estimation bias or instability, in general they perform relatively well against the other approaches and provide a useful and efficient way of fitting a wide variety of GLMMs. The use of a first or second order HGLM approach is generally preferable to PQL to achieve lower estimation biases. If PQL is employed, it is suggested that the first order Laplace approximation be calculated for approximate testing of variance components.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1737</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New material: a novella, and the accompanying exegesis, How to log into the book: cyborgs and fiction</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Lucy</field><field name="description">The novella New Material explores the intersections between fictional space, cyber space and mythic space, through three characters&#8217; narratives: Jo, his cousin Mei and Lee Wei Hong.

Jo is a teen hacker and computer expert who lives fully immersed in a networked world.  Mei has come from Australia to stay with Jo&#8217;s family, fleeing her parents&#8217; divorce.  She is an avid reader and uses fictional space as an escape route from her troubled family.  Thirdly, the older Lee Wei Hong, an offset printer, whose narration takes the form of a statement to the police.It is seeing himself as his online avatar through his cousin&#8217;s eyes that Jo begins transformation and when Mei insists they need to experience a rainstorm Jo comes into contact with physical reality in a way he has been avoiding.

In a state of passion he takes the printed pages of the review copy his company has, and throws them off the tenth storey of the National Library.  This is his criminal act.These are the pages that Jo and Mei have found, read and also been inspired to act upon.  Through his hacking Jo has unearthed a series of emails that read well as fiction.  He and Mei decide to send them on to the author to influence his next book. Exegesis &#8211; How to Log into the Book: Cyborgs and FictionAbstractThe exegesis situates the novella New Material in the surrounding landscape of literary fiction writing and theoretical posthumanism in two ways.  First, it discusses the novel within the framework of two other novels, Peter Carey&#8217;s My Life as a Fake and Jeanette Winterson&#8217;s The PowerBook, both of which deal in very different ways with the cyborg within fiction, as both constructed character and constructed author.  Secondly, the exegesis draws on the work of theorists and researchers Elizabeth Grosz&#8217; Space, Time, Perversion - the Politics of Bodies, Donna Haraway&#8217;s "A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology and Socialist Feminisim in the Late Twentieth Century", N Katherine Hayles&#8217;  How We Became Post-Human: Virtual Bodies in Cybernetics, Literature and Informatics and Sherry Turkle&#8217;s Life on Screen; Identity and the Age of the Internet.

To investigate whether this is the case with our model species, the Australian painted dragon lizard Ctenophorus pictus, we characterised a number of morph-specific traits. We demonstrate that red-headed males beat yellow-headed males in staged contests for females and that this is linked to what appears to be a convention of red dominance in male-male interactions set very early in ontogeny, long before colouration has developed. Red dominance was also observed in the field, where red males have territories with higher perch density and begin their territory defense three weeks before yellow males in some years. Red males also have higher testosterone levels than yellow males, which may provide a potential proximate link to the behavioural differences between them. 	In female choice experiments on single males of different colours, females did not preferentially associate with a particular morph. However, when females were allowed to choose between pairs of males of the same versus different colours, they preferred to associate with male pairs that were polymorphic. We suggest that this may be the result of selection arising from polyandrous mating benefits and show experimentally that polyandry results in increased hatching success.	Sperm competition trials in the lab showed that although yellow males copulated for a shorter period of time, they sired three times as many offspring as red males. Our mating experiments also showed that yellow males had significantly larger testes in relation to body condition than red males and that sperm storage played a highly significant role in male reproductive success.	These morph-specific differences are indicative of different reproductive strategies, with red males being more coercive or better mate guarders than yellow males, whilst yellow males may employ a sneaker type strategy to gain matings. However, we could not verify the distinct differences in morph-specific reproductive tactics in the wild that we would have predicted from our trials in captivity.	For example, inherent red dominance could result in yellow males being marginalised to poorer quality territories in terms of access to females, food, perch sites or shade. However, with a territory acquisition experiment in the wild, we found no significant effect of colour category per se, although on average red males remained closer to the release sites (our proxy for territory acquisition ability) than yellow males. We would also predict ongoing disruptive selection on space use, with red males defending well-defined territories and yellow males having larger and more loosely defined territories. Selection analysis showed that selection on space use in a natural population was not disruptive in either of the two years studied. Thus, divergence of male reproductive strategies in our model species does not seem to be related to differences in space use or territoriality.	If yellow males employ a sneaker strategy, we would expect them to sire more offspring per copulation and have a greater proportion of offspring from clutches with mixed paternity. However, we show that the frequency of mixed paternity in the wild is low (&lt; 20 %), and that all morphs on average have the same number of offspring sired per year.	A contributing factor to this difference in results could be habitat constraints on the evolution and expression of morph-specific behaviour and their evolutionary divergence in painted dragons. Habitat heterogeneity in our population (along a man-made fire trail) may be too low to allow each morph to exploit their optimal strategies, and we show that polyandry is significantly more common on territories where vigilance opportunities are relatively poorer.			Painted dragons are also polymorphic in bib colour. Red males with a bib are in better body condition than red males that lack a bib, which contrasts sharply to yellow males, in which males with a bib are in poorer condition than yellow males that lack a bib. In a field experiment we found that males without a bib lost within-clutch paternity significantly more often to rivals than bibbed males. We increased the work load of males and compared &#8216;loaded&#8217; males against controls with respect to how they maintained body mass during the mating season. Unexpectedly, bibbed males consistently lost more body weight across all treatments and controls. Thus, higher quality signalers may be more efficient at converting signals into fitness, in spite of higher marginal costs. 	During the last three months we have managed to stimulate cryptic females to express their underlying colouration using testosterone implants, and we are currently collecting data that could allow us to elucidate the genetic inheritance of this fascinating colour polymorphism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/71</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technology and the improvement of mathematics education at the tertiary level</field><field name="creator">Aminifar, Elahe</field><field name="description">In recent times, technology is being used more and more in a variety of educational endeavours. This thesis considers the use of technology in the improvement of teaching and learning mathematics in higher education. In particular, it addresses, through three case studies, specific technological solutions to two well documented educational problems: the knowledge gap between secondary school and university level mathematics and how to provide higher level, honours or postgraduate, mathematics offering despite low student numbers.A literature review provides the context of the problem and an overview of previous attempts at solving this difficulty.The first case study addresses a common problem concerning students entering university from high school. It has been reported that students who enter university have insufficient mathematics knowledge and skills to take first year mathematics subjects and hence provide a sound mathematical foundation for other subjects. In this study at the University of Wollongong, video learning resources, predominantly worked solutions, have been developed to assist Engineering students in a first year mathematics subject. The four-stage evaluation model of Alexander and Hedberg (1994) was used to determine the effectiveness of the resources involved at each of the stages: Design, Development, Implementation and Institutionalisation. Evaluation addresses both the production methods and the learning outcomes. A mixed methodology combining surveys, interviews, and document analysis, was used to triangulate evaluation results at each of the four stages.In 2006, two different technologies were used to produce video resources for a limited number of mathematics questions. In the first instance this was to determine the ease of production and the students&#8217; preferences for the resources. Following this trial, a set of video resources which covered all the topics taught during the first four weeks of the teaching session was developed. These resources were used to examine whether or not they could be used to bridge the gap from high school to university. Analysis indicated that the resources were used by students whose mean baseline performance was lower than non-users (t 74 = 2.18, p = 0.033). In week four the results of Basic Skills Test 2 revealed that students who used the resources improved more than those who did not (t 72 = 2.43, p = 0.018), however, catching-up on fundamental mathematical skills was insufficient for there to be an impact on the final results in the subject. Surveys in the middle and at the end of the teaching session showed that students found the video resources were useful in helping them to learn and understand mathematics. Consequently, a set of video resources that covered all mathematics topics in the subject was developed for incoming students in 2007. To ascertain the impact of these resources, two cohorts of students were examined: students from 2004 with no resources and students in 2007 with a complete set of resources. Having established that baseline performance was the same, the students with resources were found to have improved their performance in all assessment tasks compared to students without resources: Basic Skills Test 2 (t 390 = 3.14, p = 0.002), assignments (t 456 = 2.80, p = 0.005), quizzes (t 456 = 3.49, p = 0.001), examination marks  (t 456 = 3.03, p = 0.003), and final marks (t 446 = 2.38, p = 0.018), except in the Mid-Session Test (t 467 = 0.65, p = 0.519). The failure rate fell significantly in 2007 compared to the years between 2000 and 2006 (Z = 2.10, p &lt; 0.05). Students&#8217; surveys suggest that while the primary gains have been in algorithmic learning, students consider they have better understanding of concepts. The final stage of institutionalisation reveals that the university has adopted and further extended the approach for the development of mathematics learning resources across disciplines.The second case study addressed the use of two-way communication technologies for teaching and learning for geographically dispersed students at the tertiary level and in particular, for mathematics. To do this, the author of this thesis worked in an apprenticeship model with the guidance of the Manager of Learning Facilities and Technologies at the University of Wollongong to compare a selection of Real Time Communication (RTC) technologies using several criteria. These were based on the needs of teachers and students, the institutional infrastructure and the literature. As there are a variety of Real Time Communication (RTC) technologies, a two-stage evaluation was adopted. In the first stage, a list of RTC technologies was composed based on criteria found in advertising and promotional materials. In the second stage, each of the short-listed RTC technologies was trialled to determine their effectiveness and efficiency in teaching and learning. At the end of this case study, one of the RTC technologies, which provides multiple video and audio tracks of all participants as well as application sharing such as shared desktop and whiteboard, namely Access Grid, was installed and trialled.With two other universities, also funded by the International Centre of Excellence for Education in Mathematics (ICE-EM), the opportunity arose for the third case study focussing on the question, &#8216;How do universities provide a wide range of subjects to honours and upper level students when numbers of mathematics students and staff are small?&#8217;. The aim of installing a room-based node on the Access Grid was to teach and share the mathematics and statistics subjects with other Australian universities which had installed a room-based node. Three lecturers and eight students were interviewed and surveyed to evaluate the use of the Access Grid in teaching and learning these subjects. The lecturers and the students were tolerant of many technical failures, expecting them as part of the process of introducing new technology and recognising the opportunity provided by sharing classes. Two issues were identified: the need to train staff in the use of new pedagogical approaches and the fact that lecturers did not necessarily perceive the communication difficulties experienced by their students.The thesis concludes with a look to the future of technology in mathematics education and makes recommendations for embedding video resources within subjects in the other disciplines. Recommendations are also made for the use of synchronous technology such as Access Grid in teaching and learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/258</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A phenomenological study of advanced learners in educational settings suited to their academic needs</field><field name="creator">Eddles-Hirsch, Katrina</field><field name="description">This study explored the lifeworld of 27 academically advanced primary students in educational environments that have attempted to address their atypical learning needs. A phenomenological theoretical framework was used to discover the experiences of 13 gifted boys and 14 gifted girls attending either single-gender or co-educational schools. Three types of school settings were purposefully selected for this study in order to discover the supportive systems that these different educational environments created for academically advanced learners. While there is a great deal of research about the cognitive outcomes of these types of school environments, little is known about their social and emotional outcomes. Some researchers, as well as educators in the field, have suggested that the affective outcomes of these types of school settings may be a more powerful argument for gifted programming than their well known cognitive results (Coleman, 1995, 2003).The results from this study demonstrate that, while challenging instruction was clearly important for the emotional wellbeing of the advanced learners, it went hand in hand with the schools` ethos in relation to the social and emotional development of their student populations.  The schools&#8217; objectives clearly influenced students&#8217; perceptions of emotional safety, acceptance of diversity, and teacher student and peer relations in the schools` environments. This finding differs to previous research that suggests that if a gifted child&#8217;s cognitive abilities are catered for, her or his social and emotional needs will automatically be met. This research has significance for educators and researchers in the field, as it provides insights from the gifted students themselves about their experiences in the specialised school environments, which hopefully will assist educators in better meeting the psychosocial and emotional needs of these students. This study also describes the types of social and emotional support systems, and social and emotional outcomes that can contribute to optimal social context in schools. In this study optimal describes a school setting that positively answers and enhances both the academic as well as the social and emotional needs of the gifted student.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1917</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomy of a disaster: the IMF's war on corruption in Indonesia and the effects of structural adjustment</field><field name="creator">Lysaght, Georgia</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the advice given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Indonesia, during and after the Asian crisis and the impact that this had on corruption and subsequently Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It argues that the key mistake made by the IMF was the assumption that foreign business is averse to corruption and state involvement in economic development. This assumption relied on a key tenet of neo-liberalism &#8212; that the only state intervention in the economy should be to ensure the primacy of the so-called free market. While the aim of the IMF&#8217;s Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in Indonesia was to stem the crisis and facilitate economic recovery, Indonesia&#8217;s economic, social and political situation continued to deteriorate after the implementation of the IMF 'reforms'. The thesis argues that the Indonesian experience provides a number of lessons for developing economies, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), and the neo-liberal project generally. Specifically these are that corruption can operate in a functional or dysfunctional manner depending upon the political and economic environment in which it exists; that democratisation processes within a state cannot be achieved quickly simply by altering its political structure; that developing states have a valid role in regulating investment and the economy for the purpose of economic development; that the state can play a role in preventing or at least reducing the impact of a major financial crisis; that neither national economies nor the international financial system are insulated from vested interests; that FDI privileges economic certainty and profit over issues of economic regulation and corruption; and that the so-called free market system is dependent upon state intervention to prevent collapse.  In Indonesia's case, while the IMF program sought to reduce the high level of corruption by diffusing politico-business power and dismantling the country&#8217;s authoritarian system of government, the measures succeeded only in fragmenting corruption so that any previously existing checks and balances were abolished. Instead of improving the situation with respect to FDI, these measures resulted in intolerable levels of economic and business uncertainty for foreign investors. Indonesia was no longer considered an attractive place for business to invest as the country became too economically and politically volatile. In fact, while other crisis-affected countries had begun to recover by 1999, Indonesia&#8217;s economic situation remained volatile until 2005, when its political situation stabilised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/355</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing the Quaternary landscape evolution and climate history of western Flores: an environmental and chronological context for an archaeological site</field><field name="creator">Westaway, Kira E</field><field name="description">The recent discovery of a late-surviving new human species, Homo floresiensis, in western Flores has accentuated our lack of understanding of the history of the genus Homo in Asia and of the environmental challenges that may have influenced these hominins. Western Flores contains a wealth of archaeological and palaeoanthropological material with far-reaching implications for human evolution and for Indonesian, Australian and world archaeology. But the interpretation of this evidence has been hindered by a limited Quaternary context and age control for complex stratigraphies in a region of great geological instability and widespread environmental change.Liang Bua in western Flores is a key site in the Indonesian archaeological record, providing evidence of cave occupation by Homo floresiensis and Homo sapiens, and human evolution and dispersal on the eastern side of Wallace&#8217;s Line. In this study, archaeologically-relevant information has been gleaned from an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of this site, and has established the timing of key events, such as the first exposure of the cave and the nature of, and influences on, human occupation of the cave. This approach incorporated studies of landscape evolution, river terrace and cave development, sedimentology of cave sediments, palaeoclimate signals in speleothems, and a dating strategy utilising novel approaches to luminescence dating.The research reported here provides a chronological and environmental backdrop to the human occupation of Liang Bua. A maximum age of cave occupation is shown to correspond to the time of cave exposure (~190 ka), which also represents a minimum age for the human habitation of the area. In addition, this study has established an age range for the occupation of the cave by Homo floresiensis (95&#8211;11 ka), the time of the most intensive phases of occupation (74&#8211;61 and 17&#8211;11 ka), the depositional age of the holotype skeleton (36&#8211;14 ka), and the age of the oldest human skeletal remains found on Flores (95&#8211;74 ka). Through the integration of techniques, a framework for terrace development and landscape evolution has been developed to establish the Quaternary Westaway, setting in which the cave was formed and evolved. These techniques have also defined a sequence of geomorphological and sedimentological changes in the cave, enabling the reconstruction of the occupational environment. At least two zones of occupation have been identified: a zone established ~74&#8211;61 ka, and a later zone established ~18 ka.The environmental backdrop for the arrival and dispersal of humans throughout Indonesia has been established via a palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental analysis of speleothem records. These records contain evidence of multiple wet phases (110&#8211;98, 82&#8211;65, 49&#8211;39 and 17&#8211;5 ka) and a flourishing fauna. The timing of these wet phases correlate with evidence for channel and flowstone formation, episodic erosion events, and the most intensive periods of occupation in the cave. There is also evidence for a prolonged period of reduced rainfall (36&#8211;17 ka) in an organic-poor environment, the timing of which correlates with evidence of reduced erosion, pooling and less intense occupation. These correlations suggest that the occupational success of Homo floresiensis in this area was related to the contemporaneous environmental conditions, which, combined with the evidence for at least two volcanic events (one of which may have forced human migration), establish a link between hominids and their environment.The results of this research indicate the value of using an interdisciplinary approach to investigate and interpret archaeological sites in Southeast Asia. By providing an environmental and chronological context for important archaeological finds, we can develop a better understanding of the prehistory of Homo in Asia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/562</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A linguistic exploration of persuasion in written Japanese discourse: a systemic functional interpretation</field><field name="creator">Sano, Motoki</field><field name="description">This thesis is designed to explore how the social act of persuasion is realised in Japanese discourse linguistically. Specifically, it explores those linguistic resources that are essential for constructing written persuasive texts from a Systemic Functional perspective. The present study, as a case study, analyses eleven written persuasive texts. This thesis presents the result of the study. It illustrates those elements of structure and meanings that must be and can be utilised in constructing persuasive texts. It also demonstrates how these elements and their meanings can be realised through linguistic resources such as TRANSITIVITY, ATTITUDE and ELLIPSIS. 	The thesis tentatively proposes that in Japanese written persuasive texts, the act of persuasion is constructed via setting up a position that is not just that of the writer but also that of the reader. This rhetorical strategy is realised by elements which i) attract the reader to the discourse, ii) evoke empathy from the reader and iii) state the position that the writer wants to &#8216;share&#8217; with the reader implicitly or explicitly. The semantic style of persuasion is motivated socially, which is explained by the notion of homologisation (cf. Ikegami 1991), a sociological theory which models the identification of commonality in Japanese society. It is within the framework of homologisation, that the Japanese writer &#8216;relativises&#8217; themselves with the reader, and, rather than establish their own &#8216;individual&#8217; position, they establish a &#8216;common&#8217; position with the reader.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/21</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting a rapid response during psychotherapy for depression</field><field name="creator">Comninos, Andreas</field><field name="description">Rationale. According to &#8216;sudden gains&#8217; and &#8216;rapid response&#8217; methods, considerable numbers of patients experience large robust reductions in depression in early sessions across a range of psychotherapeutic modalities. Yet, surprisingly few researchers have investigated the processes that might help explain this phenomenon.Aims. Accordingly, the aims of this thesis were threefold: 1) To replicate previous findings of a rapid response to psychotherapy, 2) To investigate the role of empirically supported pre-existing interpersonal patient factors, 3) To examine systematically the therapeutic processes that characterise both rapid and gradual response profiles.Methods. Sixty-two adults received 16 weekly sessions of supportive-expressive dynamic psychotherapy (Luborsky et al., 1995). A rapid response was defined as a reduction of at least 50% of patients&#8217; intake Beck Depression Inventory score by Week 6. Following a comparison between rapid and gradually responding patients&#8217; attachment and interpersonal patterns, 20 (10 rapid-, 10 gradual-responders&#8217;) early therapy sessions (session 3) were rated with the Psychotherapy Process Q-Set (PQS; Jones, 2000). The PQS is a pan-theoretical method of systematically characterising therapist-patient interactions that provides a meaningful index of process that can be used in comparative analyses.Results. Over one third of patients (23/62) experienced a rapid response, by Session 6. This accounted for an average 96% of their entire symptom reductions. Rapid responders were more than twice as likely to recover by Session 16, and were significantly less depressed at 52 week follow-up, after adjusting for intake symptom levels. Rapid responders also presented with fewer interpersonal problems. On the other hand, pre-therapy characteristics of gradually responding patients included having lower interpersonal mastery, a more domineering interpersonal style, and greater social isolation and attachment fears concerning intimacy.The interpersonal differences between rapid and gradually responding patients were reflected in differences in psychotherapy processes. Despite equivalent ratings of observer-rated working alliance, results from the PQS suggested that as early as Session 3, rapid responders were at a more advanced stage of therapy, characterized by a willingness to work on strong emotions such as guilt. In contrast, gradual responders&#8217; sessions were dominated by externalising, hostility, and defensiveness.Conclusion. Pre-existing interpersonal patient factors determine the speed of recovery in psychotherapy through their differential effects on therapeutic process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/145</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An exploration of the challenges of sustainable and effective professional development for English as second language teachers in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Gajadeera, Sudharma Rohini</field><field name="description">This study explores challenges of sustainable and effective professional development for English as Second Language (ESL) teachers in Sri Lanka. It aims to critically examine how the existing English teacher education system as a whole responds to the wider context of the crisis of sustainability in the quality of teaching and learning. It further aims to investigate perceptions of various stakeholders regarding issues, concerns and constraints of ESL teachers in order to explore approaches, strategies and changes needed to enhance effective and sustainable English teacher education within the system. In order to capture the complexity of the education system as a whole, &#8216;Systems Thinking&#8217; paradigm has been adopted. It views the organizational behaviour and its respective environment as a complex whole of interrelating, interdependent parts rather than fragmented entities, which go beyond simple cause and effect relationships. A qualitative research approach has been used to investigate the experiences, opinions, presuppositions, and interpretations of stakeholders in this complex context. The multiple case studies conducted via fifty-seven informants represent the whole education system namely at the higher, middle and classroom management levels. The methods of data collection encompass focus groups, semi structured interviews and analysis of documents. Six key themes emerged from the analysis of data, namely policy and reforms; administration and management; implementation; structure; curriculum development; and working environment and resources. The research findings reveal the necessity for well-documented policies for English teacher education and the need for systemic management and administration with a shared vision, collaboration and personal mastery to establish tri-level development and effective networks. The lack of sufficient resources is found to be a key challenge in promoting sustainable and effective professional development practices island-wide. These findings are also the bases for recommendations and further research to cater for the socio-economic-political and global demands of post-colonial Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/196</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening comprehension processes and strategies of Japanese junior high school students in interactive settings</field><field name="creator">Tokeshi, Masanori</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of interactive listening and the characteristics of listening comprehension processes for Japanese junior high school students of English. The first aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between the learner&#8217;s listening strategies and the speaker&#8217;s speech modifications and non-linguistic cues. The second aim was to investigate the listening comprehension processes and listening strategies used by the participants. The methodology employed was primarily qualitative. The literature on listening comprehension models, research areas of difficulties with listening and speech modifications and strategy research were chiefly reviewed. Six selected Japanese junior high school case study students (from a population N=19) and a native speaker (Assistant Language Teacher) participated in this study. Three different types of listening tasks were used to elicit the data. The data collection was mainly based on stimulated recall procedures and task observation. The data analysis followed grounded theory methodology. The first part of the data analysis indicated that concrete visual referents, contextual cues and speech modifications accompanied by gestures were conductive to listening comprehension for basic level listeners. The data indicated that bottom-up processing and top-down processing interacted with each other. The participants were likely to pay selective attention to an individual known word (s). The second part of the analysis identified 25 types of listening strategies and categorized them as the metacognitive strategies, cognitive strategies and social/affective strategies. The use of listening strategies was shown to greatly depend on task type, L2 proficiency, context and listener&#8217;s affective factors. The data also showed that interactive listening as a collaborative process between the listener and speaker to enhances comprehensibility. Repetition by a native speaker was found to be the most effective cue for listening comprehension, while elaboration was the least effective. A major implication of this study is that greater emphasis on interactive listening would promote the communicative language ability of Japanese students of English in their English lessons.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/357</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The implementation of a curriculum innovation: a study of using IT for teaching and learning in the Hong Kong institute of vocational education</field><field name="creator">Koo, Chung NA</field><field name="description">The rapid development of technology and explosion of information on the Internet had lead to a surge of using IT for teaching and learning among different education sectors.  In the light of this, many education institutions had developed policy in implementing IT for teaching and learning to improve and enhance the quality of the courses they provided.This thesis reports a study of using IT for teaching and learning by teachers in the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE), as an implementation of a curriculum innovation.  The aim of this study was to investigate how teachers behaved in the implementation process rather than to investigate the effectiveness of IT brought to teaching and learning.Different research methods were used to answer the research questions posed for the study.  An &#8220;Implementation Rubric&#8221; was established to find out how the innovation was implemented by IVE teachers.  Both qualitative and quantitative methods were used to identify the factors that hindered and enhanced the implementation.  Document analysis was also adopted to triangulate the evidence gathered from surveys and interviews.Results of this research indicated that, in general, the innovation was implemented by IVE teachers, although the degree of implementation of individual dimensions and sub-dimensions varied.  This study identified eight critical factors that hindered the implementation of the innovation.  Although some of the factors have been commonly mentioned in the literature, the study adds additional perspectives to it, in particular in the context of vocational education in Hong Kong.  Each of these factors is discussed in detail and compared with the literature for better interpretation.  This study also investigated the issues IVE teachers encountered during the implementation of the innovation and the ways they resolved these issues.The implications of the findings are discussed, and finally eight recommendations for improving the current practices and four suggestions for further research are proposed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3044</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of vessel-source pollution in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore</field><field name="creator">Emran, Amelia</field><field name="description">The high volume of traffic passing through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore continuously exposes the Straits to the problem of vessel-source pollution, particularly oil pollution. As a strait used for international navigation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (LOSC 1982), regulation of vessel-source pollution by the littoral States are confined within the provisions of the LOSC 1982. The thesis examines the provisions of the LOSC 1982 with regard to the prescriptive and enforcement powers of strait States to address vessel-source pollution in straits used for international navigation. As a case study, the thesis analyses the Malaysian domestic legislative framework to implement the relevant LOSC 1982 provisions in the Malaysian part of the Strait of Malacca. The thesis also examines the existing cooperative arrangements in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore pursued under the provisions of the LOSC 1982 and the extent to which they address vessel-source pollution in the Straits. The thesis concludes that strait States are granted by the LOSC 1982, very limited prescriptive and enforcement jurisdiction to regulate vessel-source pollution in straits used for international navigation. In the context of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, the thesis establishes the gaps in Malaysia&#8217;s implementation of the provisions of the LOSC 1982 in the Malaysian part of the Strait of Malacca. The thesis also establishes that cooperation has yet to fully materialise in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore and even where it is pursued, focus is on navigational safety issues rather than the problem of vessel-source pollution in the Straits.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/60</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of household footwear-surface interactions on the gait of older arthritic females</field><field name="creator">Munro, Bridget J</field><field name="description">Inappropriate footwear, poor footwear-surface interactions and gait adaptations resulting from musculoskeletal problems, such as arthritis and foot problems, are all factors that contribute to home slips. However, no research was located which identified the effects of interactions between household footwear and household surface characteristics on variables that may predispose older individuals to fall in the home. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis was to identify how different household shoe-surface interactions affected the gait of older people, particularly those with foot problems, to recommend a &#8220;safe&#8221; household shoe for older people. To achieve this purpose, this thesis was completed in two experimental sections. Experimental Section A comprised surveying 60 men and 68 women aged 65 years and above who lived independently in the community to identify the requirements and attitudes of older people living independently in the community in relation to their household footwear wearing and purchasing habits. Statistical analyses were conducted using chi-square tests, independent t-tests and z-scores to determine whether any relationships existed between the variables as well as the effects of gender. The main health condition reported by both men (37%) and women (50%) was arthritis. Women reported significantly more foot problems (2.3 per woman) than men (1.4 per man) as well as significantly greater foot pain and/or discomfort (59% women, 45% men). Furthermore, a greater number of women (25%) had fallen in the 12 months before the survey compared to men (17%). Shoes were worn in and around the house by 79% respondents, with the most popular household shoe type being the slipper, with 56% respondents indicating they wore both closed back and toe slippers around the home. The type of household shoe worn was significantly related to gender such that women predominantly wore closure-free, non-rigid household shoe types compared to men who tended to wear shoes with closures around the home. Only 30% of respondents did not wear household shoes, with most walking barefoot around the home (89.5%). The most slippery surface reported was that of smooth tiles (40.6%) with several respondents indicating they felt uneasy on wet surfaces, particularly tiles. It was concluded that Experimental Section B should focus upon the walking patterns displayed by older rheumatoid arthritic (RA) females when wearing toe and closed back slippers and walking on typical household surfaces, particularly wet surfaces. Experimental Section B examined the effects of household footwear-surface interactions on the biomechanical parameters characterising initial foot-ground contact, as this phase of the gait cycle most commonly results in slips. Subjective perceptions, kinematic, kinetic and neuromuscular data were collected at initial foot-ground contact as eight community-dwelling older women with RA and eight matched controls walked at a self-selected pace along a 6 m walkway under three footwear conditions (barefoot, closed back slippers, toe slippers) and three surface conditions (carpet, dry vinyl tile, wet vinyl tile). Mixed repeated measures three-way ANOVA were then completed to determine whether subject group, shoe type or surface type significantly (p &#8804; 0.05) influenced the gait patterns at initial foot-ground contact. Compared to the control subjects, RA subjects displayed similar activity levels, segmental proportionality and plantar sensation, although increased foot pain and knee flexibility, decreased knee and ankle muscle strength and altered static and dynamic plantar pressure patterns. Despite displaying similar gait characteristics, the RA subjects estimated the walking trials to be significantly more difficult and experienced significantly more pain compared to the control subjects. The within-footwear main effects revealed that when subjects walked in toe slippers they found them to be uncomfortable and slippery, requiring significantly altered muscle activation patterns (earlier vastus lateralis (VL), tibialis anterior (TA) and peroneus longus (PL) onset; earlier gastrocnemius (G) offset; longer PL duration; increased TA intensity) compared to walking in closed back slippers. Within-footwear changes to muscle activation strategies (earlier rectus femoris (RF), VL and PL onset; earlier G offset; longer biceps femoris duration; decreased TA intensity) and kinetic profiles (decreased peak vertical and anteroposterior braking forces) were also evident when subjects walked barefoot compared to walking shod. Furthermore, the within-surface main effects indicated that when subjects walked on the wet vinyl-tile surface, they perceived the surface as more slippery, more difficult to walk upon and less comfortable, requiring significantly altered muscle activation patterns (later RF offset; earlier TA offset; longer RF duration; shorter VL duration; increased RF and semitendinosus (S) intensity), kinetic profiles (decreased peak anteroposterior braking forces) and kinematic profiles (decreased foot/shoe angle and angular velocity). Interestingly, footwear x surface interactions indicated that the subjects displayed significantly altered movement control strategies (longer RF and G duration; increased RF, VL and S intensity; decreased anteroposterior braking forces and foot/shoe angular velocity) and subjective perceptions (increased task difficulty and shoe/surface slipperiness; decreased shoe comfort) when subjects walked barefoot on the wet vinyl tile surface compared to all other conditions. It was concluded that older women, particularly those with RA should wear closed back slippers, in preference to toe slippers, around the home, to reduce their incidence of foot pain and/or discomfort as well as to reduce their slip risk at initial foot-ground contact, particularly when walking on slippery surfaces. Further research is recommended to determine whether the prescription of closed back slippers, considered to be &#8220;safe&#8221; in the present thesis, does in fact reduce falls, particularly slips, in the homes of older women</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/657</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative ecology of rare and common species in a fire-prone system</field><field name="creator">Ooi, Mark K.J.</field><field name="description">Due to escalating rates of extinction around the world, it is important to focus research and management on those species most at risk. Factors such as climate change and human population growth are also placing increasing pressure on species that are currently more common and widespread. Understanding the ecology of common species as well as those species that are already threatened is therefore central to conservation biology. In particular, studies targeting species for which little or nothing is currently known can increase our general ecological knowledge and also help to identify species with critical life history traits that could be limiting under future environmental scenarios. The Ericaceae family in Australia (formerly Epacridaceae) is an example of one such group of species. Our current understanding of the ecology of the Ericaceae in this region is poor, even though species within this family make up a significant proportion of the understorey in temperate, fire-prone plant communities. To address this gap in our knowledge, I selected several obligate-seeding shrub species within the genus Leucopogon (Ericaceae) as the focus for this study in south-eastern Australia. Obligate-seeding species such as these, with soil-stored seed banks, have been the subject of far fewer studies than their counterparts that resprout or have canopy-stored seed banks. I used a demographic approach, aimed at providing fundamental ecological data for a rare species, Leucopogon exolasius, and some common and more widespread congeneric taxa, in order to explore processes that potentially limit their relative abundance. Plants of obligate-seeding species are killed by fire, so persistence of populations is dependent primarily on regeneration from stored seed. Fundamental to understanding any aspect of seed ecology is being able to determine whether a seed is viable and dormant or inviable. Taking this primary step in this study was complicated by the fact that the adequacy of the most common method used for checking seed viability, the tetrazolium test, is hard to assess for difficult to germinate species such as Leucopogon, and there are no data assessing its applicability for most Australian species. I therefore compared the results of the tetrazolium test with a simple cut test. When estimating the proportion of viable seeds, a strong correlation was found between the two methods for the three species of Leucopogon used (r &gt; 0.9). The cut test and tetrazolium test both also produced good estimates of viability of seed lots when compared to germination potential of non-dormant seeds retrieved from burial. The results not only supported the use of the less laborious cut test as a reliable method for estimating seed viability throughout this study, but also provided information to assist the accuracy and applicability of the tetrazolium method, previously unavailable for this group of native Australian species. Dormancy-breaking cues for species within the genus Leucopogon are poorly understood and appear to be complex, with laboratory studies often resulting in little or no germination. Due to the difficulties experienced in germinating Leucopogon in other studies, I initially established dormancy class in order to identify the mechanisms responsible for controlling dormancy of the three study species. Assessment of seed morphology and preliminary laboratory germination experiments led me to classify the primary dormancy of L. exolasius, L. setiger and L. esquamatus as morphophysiological. Further germination trials revealed that seasonal temperatures overcame primary dormancy and controlled the timing of germination, as has been found for other species with a physiological dormancy component. Despite the fact that the study species display a flush of post-fire seedling emergence in the field, fire cues did not break primary dormancy. Once seasonal temperatures overcame primary dormancy, however, there was a trend for smoke to enhance germination. Knowing if fire is responsible for breaking dormancy, or whether it simply enhances levels of post-fire germination for seeds in which dormancy has been overcome by other factors, is important for a greater understanding of plant population dynamics. Dormancy had not previously been classified for any species from this fire-prone region, and it was unknown whether physiological dormancy was a common trait, or perhaps a potential cause of rarity. It was also unknown whether a lack of response by Leucopogon seeds to fire cues was particular to these species, or a consequence of physiological dormancy mechanisms generally. To investigate this, I estimated the relative proportions of dormancy types for shrub species which occurred in fire-prone habitats in south-eastern Australia. I also assessed the literature for evidence of the effects of fire cues on species with a physiological dormancy component. Representatives of all dormancy classes were found to occur in the region, in proportions similar to that estimated for other fire-prone regions around the world. Over 50% of shrub species had a physiological dormancy component, whilst over 40% had physical dormancy. Additionally, when the assessment was confined to threatened species, the relative proportion of physiologically dormant species represented increased, indicating that dormancy type plays a role in determining rarity. Seasonal temperatures, not fire cues, were the main factors that broke physiologically related dormancy mechanisms. Physiological factors, and therefore seasonal temperatures, are likely to be important in controlling the dormancy and patterns of post-fire germination of many species in fire-prone regions.Obligate-seeding species are dependent on recruitment from the seed bank for populations to recover after fire. Longevity of seeds stored in the soil is therefore a particularly critical life history trait of the study species. Two points were addressed in this part of the study. Firstly, I estimated the relative seed bank longevities of the L. exolasius, L. setiger and L. esquamatus. A short-lived seed bank in relation to typical fire return intervals for the region would indicate this as a cause of species rarity. Secondly, I wanted to determine whether primary dormancy was required for seed bank persistence, and whether the distinction between dormancy and persistence affects our understanding of seed bank dynamics in fire-prone regions. Using in situ seed burial trials, I found that all three species had persistent seed banks, with estimated halflives between 3.5 and 5.5 years. Laboratory germination trials and embryo measurements of retrieved seeds showed that primary dormancy was broken during the first year of burial, and I concluded that specific requirements were therefore needed for germination. These results supported the findings from the previous germination Chapter, and supported the conclusion that fire cues that are observed to promote germination in situ are not necessarily the ones that break dormancy. Most studies in fire-prone regions have failed to distinguish between these two factors, with attention subsequently diverted away from mechanisms actually controlling dormancy and seed bank dynamics.Realising the potential importance of seasonal germination cues highlighted by previous Chapters, I formulated the hypothesis that seasonal emergence patterns are more likely for species with a physiological dormancy component than their physically dormant counterparts. In regions like south-eastern Australia, which has no distinct rainfall season, seasonal germination could delay post-fire seedling emergence, and subsequently hinder recruitment, depending on the timing of the fire event. I therefore assessed the impact of seasonally delayed emergence and fire season on recruitment success of the three study species, and ascertained how vulnerable they are to changes to fire season. Post-fire seedling survival and growth were measured after the same fire event, comparing the physiologically dormant Leucopogon species (displaying seasonal emergence) with physically dormant or &#8220;hard-seeded&#8221; species (displaying season-independent emergence). I found that Leucopogon emergence was delayed compared to physically dormant species and, as a consequence, both survival and growth were significantly reduced. Intra-specific comparisons of Leucopogon species after winter and summer fires, indicated that seasonal germination requirements delayed seedling emergence by 12 months after winter fires, in relation to other co-occurring species, and by 3 to 6 months after summer fires. Seedlings emerging after summer fires grew and matured more quickly than those emerging after winter fires. Because species with physically dormant seeds have quick emergence tied closely to fire, whereas the speed of emergence of physiologically dormant species is dependent on fire season, I concluded that fire might not have been the primary force selecting for physiologically dormant species. Season of fire could strongly influence the persistence of the study species, and other seasonally emerging species. The final aim of this study was to assess any potential causes of rarity In addition to the fundamental ecological data already collected for several key life history traits, data on fecundity, dispersal mechanisms and seedling survival and growth were also analysed and used in a comparative assessment, to establish whether there were any plausible causes of rarity of L. exolasius. Compared to the two common congeners, L. setiger and L. esquamatus, as well as to other obligate-seeding species in the region, L. exolasius had a markedly longer primary juvenile period. This raises the likelihood that short inter-fire intervals cause local extinction of populations of this species by killing plants prior to maturation and seed bank replenishment. Seasonal emergence, identified during the analyses of physiological dormancy mechanisms, also had the potential to increase the length of the maturation period. Local extinction of the Emu, a large bird and primary long distance dispersal mechanism for fleshy-fruited species, may have limited opportunities for range expansion and recolonisation. The investigation of critical life history stages during this study has led to the conclusion that L. exolasius persistence appears to be bound to fire frequency. More surprising, however, is the finding that fire season could potentially influence persistence considerably, not only of L. exolasius, but of a large proportion of species with physiological dormancy that occur in fireprone regions. Consequently, the ability of L. exolasius, and many other species, to persist in the future would be compromised by changes to the fire regime. The impacts of implemented fires and the effects of climate change are both forecast to promote higher fire frequency and cause changes to peak fire season. These changes could represent significant threats to L. exolasius populations, as well as to many other obligate-seeding species in the region with long primary juvenile periods and physiological dormancy. Further research into the effects of seasonal dormancy and germination requirements, particularly in relation to fire season, could help to gain a greater understanding of plant population dynamics and persistence in fire-prone regions.

The Tiger Quoll is considered threatened in all mainland states, it is considered rare in Tasmania, and it is listed as endangered under Federal legislation. At the commencement of this study, little was known of the biology of the Tiger Quoll and virtually nothing was known of its ecology. In this study, I used captive Tiger Quolls at Featherdale Wildlife Park in Sydney, and wild populations at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve on the mid-north coast of New South Wales and at Barren Grounds Nature Reserve and Budderoo National Park on the Illawarra escarpment south of Sydney to investigate several aspects of Tiger Quoll biology and ecology.Studies on the breeding biology and growth of Tiger Quolls were undertaken at Featherdale Wildlife Park. Tiger Quolls have a single breeding season each year and at Featherdale Wildlife Park Tiger Quolls mated in May with births in June. Some females had a second and sometimes third oestrus cycle if the first didn&#8217;t produce pouch young. Matings and births were fairly synchronous, occurring mostly over a two to four week period with a gestation length of about 21 days. Growth curves were developed for small pouch young and juveniles and age prediction curves were developed for small pouch young up to 60 days. Both males and females reached sexual maturity in 11 months and could breed in their first breeding season following their birth. Older females reared larger litters to teat release than one-year-old females. Females increased in weight prior to the mating period, developing fat deposits around the neck. Sexual dimorphism between the sexes, males being larger, became clearly apparent by 250 days of age.In wild populations at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve, mating occurred in June with the birth of a single litter recorded in July. Wild young were smaller than same-agedcaptive young and growth of wild young is likely to be slower once they have left the pouch. Drought conditions are likely to affect the growth of young.The spatial and social organisation of Tiger Quolls was investigated at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve. Males and females were found to have large home range areas. Adult females had discrete home range areas, ranging in size from 509-1511 hectares, separate from other adult females, although some daughters occupied part of the mother&#8217;s home range area. Adult males had much larger home ranges (2302-3401 hectares), which overlapped extensively with other males, and intersected 2-4 female home ranges. Den sharing was never observed, except between mothers and young, and sequential use of dens by different individuals only occurred several months after the former occupant had disappeared. Adult females generally moved to a new den each day except after pouch young released the teat and were deposited in a maternal den. Tiger Quolls undertook extensive movements on a daily and weekly basis, particularly males, with maximum recorded daily journeys of 5 and 8.5 kilometres for females and males respectively. Over longer periods males were recorded travelling over 20 kilometres in nine days. Activity was not exclusively nocturnal for adult females that may be active in early to mid-morning and late afternoon, especially in cooler months when nursing young.Home ranges included a range of habitat types, heathland, sedgeland, shrubland, forest and woodland but the majority of locality records from trapping and radio-tracking were in forest and woodland. The majority of den sites were located within areas of eucalypt open forest and the majority of dens were eucalypt hollow logs or hollows in the trunks and limbs of live or dead standing trees. Dens were also located in burrows, which appeared to be preferred as maternal dens, under small buildings and in rocky headlands.The diet of the Tiger Quoll at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve and Barren Grounds Nature Reserve / Budderoo National Park (Illawarra) was predominantly carnivorous with a large proportion made up of vertebrate prey at both sites (85-91%). Mammals comprised the major vertebrate group with smaller contributions from birds (9-16%), reptiles (2-7%) and fish (13-24%). Insects were present in a greater proportion at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve (26%) than the Illawarra area (13%). Plant material was present in the diet at both sites, as was garbage. There was potential for some competition between the Dingo and Tiger Quoll at Limeburners Creek Nature Reserve as Dingoes took a large amount of bandicoot as prey, which was also a common prey item of Tiger Quolls.Several aspects of the biology and ecology of the Tiger Quoll make it susceptible to a range of threats. Large home range size for both males and females makes the species vulnerable to clearing and fragmentation of forest and woodland habitats, to the threat of roadkill from increased traffic density and speed and to increased direct predation from eutherian carnivores such as the fox in rural landscapes and domestic pets in urban areas. Tiger Quolls are subject to direct persecution from humans due to their attraction to kill and eat caged birds such as chickens and their attraction to carrion increases the chances of death by roadkill.The control of eutherian predators such as the fox and Dingo through 1080 poison baiting programs has the potential to affect Tiger Quoll populations through non-target kills and may have increased impact if undertaken in the restricted breeding season of Tiger Quolls and if undertaken for several consecutive years. Impacts may be greater on low-density populations. The removal of Dingoes may have a detrimental impact on Tiger Quoll populations if Dingoes are suppressing fox numbers. Further investigation of the potential impacts of poisoning programs and the relationships between eutherian and marsupial carnivores is required.The protection of a number of large Tiger Quoll populations throughout the species geographic range and the protection and enhancement of forested corridors across the landscape may provide some buffer to potential impact of disease, habitat loss or degradation, or invasion of introduced species following climate change to help ensure the species conservation and possible recolonisation of areas of its former range.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/686</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The experiences of recovery from schizophrenia: development of a definition, model and measure of recovery</field><field name="creator">Andresen, Retta</field><field name="description">The traditional view of schizophrenia as having a deteriorating long-term course and an outcome of permanent disability has been challenged both anecdotally and empirically. Therefore, the consumer movement advocates that rehabilitation services become recovery-orientated. Recovery-oriented and empirically validated services have now become policy internationally. However, the meaning of recovery in a medical or research context is different than the meaning used by consumers. The objectives of this research were, therefore to (a) formulate a consumer-oriented definition of recovery; (b) develop a conceptual model of recovery to guide research and evaluation and inform clinical practice; (c) design a measure of recovery, based on the model, and (d) to seek empirical support for the model of recovery.Study One involved a review of the consumer-oriented literature on the concept of recovery, with four aims: (a) to understand the meaning of recovery used by consumers; (b) to identify the components of recovery; (c) to formulate a definition of recovery; and (d) to define the stages of recovery. An examination of consumers&#8217; experiential accounts produced a definition of psychological recovery from the consequences of the illness. Four key processes were identified: (i) finding hope; (ii) re-establishment of identity; (iii) finding meaning in life; and (iv) taking responsibility for wellness and life generally. Five stages were synthesized from the extant qualitative research: (i) moratorium; (ii) awareness; (iii) preparation; (iv) rebuilding and (v) growth. A model of four processes developing over five stages is discussed in the light of the wider literature surrounding recovery from loss and the positive psychology literature. It is concluded that the philosophies of the positive psychology movement have much to offer in recovery-oriented approaches to treatment and research.In Study Two, a brief measure, the Self-identified stage of recovery (SISR), was designed in order to test the model. The aims were to (a) test the validity of the stage measure against continuous recovery measures; (b) to test the notion of recovery assessment as opposed to conventional measures of outcome, and (c) to seek support for the stage model of recovery. The SISR was completed by a clinical population participating in a larger study. High correlations between the recovery measures (rs = .262, p = .01 to rs = .712, p = .01) supported the validity of the SISR, while the pattern of correlations between the recovery measure subscales supported the validity of the SISR as a measure of level of recovery.  Negative to low correlations between recovery and conventional measures (rs = - .375 to rs = .191) supported the divergent validity of recovery as an outcome as distinct from conventional measures. In addition, an effect of stage was found on one conventional measure (F (4,127) = 2.9, p &lt; .05) and all recovery measures (F (4, 141) = 2.87, p&lt;.05) to F (4, 141) = 4.68 (p &lt;.001), lending support to the stage model of recovery.The aims of Study Three were to (a) produce a longer, more reliable measure that would better capture the richness of the experience of recovery; (b) examine the validity and reliability of this measure; and (c) seek further support for the stage model of recovery. The Stages of Recovery Instrument (STORI) consists of 50 items, each representing a psychological process at a stage of recovery. The STORI yields five stage subscale scores.  A postal survey of volunteers revealed that the STORI correlated with six psychological health variables (rs= 0.45 (p &lt; .01) to rs = 0 .62 (p &lt; .01). Correlational analysis provided support for an ordinal relationship between the stage subscales. An effect of stage was found on all recovery-related variables, (F (3,110) =10.70 (p &lt;.01) to F (3,111) = 24.44 (p &lt; .01). However, a cluster analysis of items resulted in three subscale clusters, rather than the expected five, revealing an overlap between adjacent stages.The results provide preliminary empirical validation of the STORI as a measure of the consumer definition of recovery. Although an effect of stage was found, refinement of the measure is needed to improve its capacity to discriminate between the stages. It could then be used in comprehensively testing the stage model using longitudinal methods and the inclusion of objective measures. The concept of recovery elucidated in this research underlines the importance of taking a positive stance to recovery, focusing on values, meaning and growth rather than on illness-focused approaches to care. The five-stage model has proven useful in clinical training and as a framework for research into recovery. Validation of the model with longitudinal research is planned. Further development of the STORI is underway in separate research, and when refined, the measure should provide an outcome assessment tool that is meaningful to consumers and a useful adjunct to conventional clinical measurement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/814</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A non-invasive analysis of the structure and function of human multi-segmental muscle</field><field name="creator">McAndrew, Darryl John</field><field name="description">The Central Nervous System (CNS) exerts extensive control over muscle activation in order to produce accurate voluntary movement, such as the complex movements of the human shoulder joint.  Muscles surrounding multi-planar joints are selectively activated depending upon the movement performed, and within the radiate musculature of the shoulder, individual muscle segments exist that are capable of exhibiting specific myoelectric intensity and temporal activation patterns.  The aim of this thesis was to assess the influence of inter-segment variations in contractile properties on the strategies employed by the CNS when producing voluntary movements.  Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that muscle segment neuromotor coordination (as determined by electromyographic analysis) would be sensitive to the contractile properties of individual muscle segments.  A key component was the variation in isometric contraction speed ranging from slow to ballistic.Mechanomyography (MMG), which is the measure of a muscle&#8217;s physical dimensional change during contraction, is founded on the premise that the temporal aspect of muscle displacement is reflective of motor unit contractile properties and consequently the muscle fibre type composition.  A series of studies were completed to establish the validity of the new Laser-MMG technique for quantifying contractile properties.  The results confirmed: 1) the sensitivity of the Laser-MMG technique to modulators of physiological performance (thermal state, fatigue state, and fibre type composition variation between segments); and 2) that the contractile properties of muscle fibres varied between the individual segments of the muscles following maximal percutaneous neuromuscular stimulation (PNS).  Most notably, &#8216;slow-twitch&#8217; contractile properties were found in muscle segments that have a greater role in producing movement in the coronal plane, while &#8216;fast-twitch&#8217; contractile properties were associated with segments having more efficient moment arms to produce movement in the sagittal plane.  Furthermore, each of the muscles investigated was associated with a distinctive anatomical distribution of muscle fibre types.  Muscle segment contractile properties were heterogeneous and their arrangement appears to reflect the most common or important joint movements.   Moreover, the muscle segments located at the periphery of all three shoulder muscles exhibited faster contractile properties than those located in the middle of the muscle.  It appears that this internal arrangement may be a consistent organisational characteristic of radiate muscles.  Muscle segments within the pectoralis major, deltoid and latissimus dorsi muscles were found to be independently controlled by the CNS through manipulation of the myoelectric activation patterns, in particular: onset time; and discharge rate.  The lower segments of the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi were identified as prime mover segments, initiating the movement and contributing the greatest myoelectric intensity.  The immediately superior segments were classified as assistant movers, activating after the prime movers and contributing less to the overall movement.  Furthermore, similarities in neuromotor coordination were identified between adjacent segments of individual muscles. The sequential &#8220;wave of segment activation&#8221; identified within each whole muscle appeared to ignore the anatomical boundaries between muscles, suggesting that the CNS coordinates individual muscle segments rather than the whole muscle as one unit in order to complete a motor task.  This further complicates the process of controlling motor tasks as there appear to be no defined limits of muscles to which discrete functions can be applied.Coordination between prime mover segments of agonist muscles was identified, with the lower segments of pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi showing no significant difference in any of the temporal myoelectric measures.  The similarity in neuromotor coordination between these segments may be the result of a common drive, suggesting that the CNS uses a simple strategy of combining the segments into one functional unit.  No gross disordering of the muscle segments&#8217; onset was identified within any of the investigated muscles, with regard to movement speed.  However, the pectoralis major exhibited altered relative timing between the segments. This was particularly evident during the fast movement.  The sequential &#8220;wave of activation&#8221; present during the slow movements became disordered as muscle contraction speed was increased.  During fast contraction, the assistant mover segments within pectoralis major were activated later than the prime mover segments changing the relative timing of their activation.  This indicates that the CNS may initially prioritise the activation of only the most essential muscle segments to commence the movement during ballistic movements, perhaps due to the imposed time constraints.  This form of change in relative timing can be interpreted as a direct reflection of the differences in muscle segment fibre type composition and hence the neuromotor control of the muscle segments involved in producing the movement.  Most notably, variation to the control of muscle segment excitation and contraction onset exist in the more centrally located muscle segments that exhibit slower segment contractile properties.  This finding appears logical when coupled with the finding of homogeneous myoelectric peak activity.  The CNS must manipulate the onset of these slower contracting segments, especially during fast movements, in order to allow enough time for all segments to achieve a uniform peak of muscle activity that occurs just prior to peak force.	The variations and coordination of contractile properties, myoelectric properties and electromyographic burst patterns between adjacent muscle segments within the same skeletal muscle confirms the notion that for CNS control, individual muscle segments are considered as sub-volumes of muscle tissue that require individual neuromotor control &#8211; that they are, in effect, muscles within muscles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/822</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A scintillation dual-detector system featuring active Compton suppression</field><field name="creator">Inwood, Dean</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the performance characterisation of two prototype scintillation dual-detector radiation monitors that feature active gamma-ray collimation and the suppression of events caused by Compton scattering. This system is currently under development at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics (CMRP) for radio-guided surgery and lymphoscintigraphy procedures involving low and high-energy gamma ray emitting isotopes. The two CMRP custom-designed configurations of dual-scintillator CsI(Tl) crystals were optically coupled to custom designed Si photodetectors. One configuration, nicknamed &#8220;CD1,&#8221; consists of an N--type Si base with P+-type circular inner and square outer regions, producing a p-n junction, while the other, &#8220;CD2,&#8221; consists of an N--type base with smaller P+-type circular inner and outer regions. Both CD1- and CD2-type configurations were investigated for their current-voltage characteristics, noise, crosstalk levels and system energy resolution for various radioisotopes. Both types of device were then integrated into a Compton-event suppression system. The devices were found to require a reverse bias voltage of not more than -60V for the CD1 type device and &#8211;30V for the CD2 type. Noise prevents the resolving of low energy peaks below around 150 keV for the CD1 type and below 100 keV for the CD2 type and crosstalk levels were found to be &lt;2% on both types of device. Energy resolution of the CD1-type inner detector was found to be approximately 13% for Cs-137&#8217;s 662 keV peak and 8% for the CD2-type inner detector, while the resolution on the outer detector was found to be 21% for Cs-137&#8217;s 662 keV peak for the CD1 type and 19% for the CD2 type. Both devices were successfully integrated into a Compton event suppression system and achieved significant levels of suppression of Compton events that would otherwise contribute to the Compton continuum. These results indicate that the dual-detector system will be satisfactory for radio-guided surgery and lymphoscintigraphy using both low and highenergy radioisotopes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/828</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial maintenance data collection and application: developing an information strategy for an industrial site</field><field name="creator">Evans, Roy F</field><field name="description">This work involved the evaluation of the efficacy of industrial information management. The study was prompted by the observation that contemporary society seemingly struggles to effectively utilise and manage the volumes of information that new technologies are delivering. It is reasonable to assume that industry, as a mirror of contemporary society, may be struggling to manage the convergence of equivalent information technologies. Traditionally, within industry, structured organisations of people use work processes to record plant history in computerised work management systems. This work employs a socio technical perspective to examine conflict that is likely to be occurring within such structured groups of people. Social (socio) in respect of participants&#8217; behavioural changes, technical in respect of understanding data selection for machine condition management.Field research used constructivist evaluation methodology in three phases. Evaluation of current information management practice, in three electricity-generating power stations, was followed by an ethnological study to determine why industrial information management developed in the way that it had. By way of comparison, a third field research phase evaluated financial and medical information management processes. At the evaluated sites, industrial information management was found to be an inadequately developed concept. Processes were found to be managed without application of explicitly stated strategies or audit protocols. Staff considered recording of work to be a transactional process directed at monitoring human performance rather than being a process for analysis to facilitate plant condition management and to develop plant knowledge.Conclusions based primarily upon the ethnographical study indicate that the effects of informal social influence, power conflict, scientific work process and job design all contribute to an imbalance that develops between explicit recording and the complementary development of a tacit knowledge base. In contrast, medical ward management employed a combination of socio technical principles and informal double loop analyses to address corresponding conflict.Outcomes of the study indicate that an evaluative matrix, developed for the study, would be suitable for professional audit of site information strategies and processes. Complementing the evaluative matrix has been the development of a practical methodology, based upon socio technical principles, which would be suitable for the development of convergent site information and production strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/92</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to boys in kindergarten talking about school</field><field name="creator">Coleborne, Roslyn</field><field name="description">The perspectives of boys on their experience in school during kindergarten have not been explored in any significant way. Still missing in the literature is critical interpretive research on young, male children&#8217;s early schooling experiences and the implications for the academic outcomes of these students. There is evidence that some boys do not perform well in secondary school (West, 1999; Coulter, 2003; Martin, 2003) and this is predictable as early as the first year of formal schooling (Barrett, 1989; Alexander et el., 1993; Rimm-Kaufmann &amp; Pianta 2000). This study adds to the literature by seeking the views of boys in kindergarten classes about what schooling means to them.A goal of this study is to understand the complex world of the lived experience of being a boy in kindergarten, from the point of view of boys who live it (Schwandt, 1998) so a qualitative, interpretive approach to the subject matter is used. Uncommon in other studies of young children, the hermeneutic phenomenological perspective of the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer (2004) and a process of analysis proposed by Max van Manen (1990) provide the framework, using a mixed methodology derived from diverse sources. Data is generated primarily by conducting individual semi-structured interviews with fourteen boys in kindergarten classes in three schools in New South Wales. This data is interspersed with excerpts from the researcher&#8217;s retrospective reflective journal covering more than forty years of teaching. In keeping with the philosophical stance of Gadamer, these statements help to illuminate the personal position and bias of the researcher. Field notes that evaluate the processes and the techniques used to collect information from young children, supplement the primary data. Interpretation of the transcripts generated by conversations with the participants shows school routines and rules figure prominently in the boys&#8217; views of school life, and play and friends, are important features of the school day. The boys say  learning is work, and it is generally conducted using a pencil and paper. This study contributes to research on what school means to young boys and what factors engage or alienate young male students in school. It demonstrates links between these views and current education policy and classroom practice.The study provides insights into the effectiveness of various research techniques used with young children. Three scaffolding techniques were used to support the interview process, including the boys drawing a picture of school life and talking about their drawing, looking at pictures of typical school activities and commenting on those, and playing a game of &#8216;schools&#8217; with the researcher using the construction toy, Lego. The study found that talking to the boys in an engaged and supportive way generated more useful data than any of the other strategies or scaffolds used. The study adds evidence to the growing body of literature that suggests children are competent in providing information about issues that are relevant to them. Future research, using a hermeneutical phenomenological approach, could include girls in Kindergarten, in order to compare and contrast their experiences with their male counterparts, and contribute to unravelling further what makes school engaging for some students, and alienating for others.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3063</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thermodynamical perspective on organisations: their structure and evolution</field><field name="creator">Sundarasaradula, Doy</field><field name="description">The aim of this research is to generate a better understanding and an insightful explanation of the nature and characteristics of organisational structure and evolution through the synthesis of thermodynamics and traditional organisational theories. As living systems, formal organisations need specific energy fluxes not only for their existence, but also for change and evolution, which are the key features that enable them to survive and prosper.The synthesis of thermodynamics and traditional organisational theories can be actualised through the application of the theory of dissipative structures and the theory of self-organisation both of which are based upon non-equilibrium thermodynamics. According to these theories, energy flowing through the systems can create temporal order and organisation as well as changes within these systems provided that their logical structure is autocatalytic.In this thesis, a system dynamics model, which is based upon two hypothetical organisation archetypes with different logical autocatalytic structure, has been developed. The model is used as a platform for simulation experiments in different scenarios with different assumptions. The experiment results suggest following findings:&#8226; Organisations can be understood as interrelated cycles of activities that manifest themselves as sinuous movements or oscillations. These wavy motions are interpreted as an organisation&#8217;s temporal structure.&#8226; An organisation&#8217;s living state, represented by its oscillating activity, depends on a proper combination of resource availability without which this state is not achievable.&#8226; The openness attributed to organisations allows them to influence and be influenced by their environment.&#8226; Organisations with different logical structure behave or response differently to the same environment.&#8226; Organisations adapt to a change in their environment by increasing activity or scale of operation in an environment in which resources are increasing and vice versa.&#8226; Changes in organisations in a complex environment are characterised by discontinuities and chaos. Note that this finding is contradictory to the traditional organisation theories as far as discontinuity is concerned.This research confirms the validity of thermodynamics in clarifying and explaining subtleties inherent in organisational phenomena. The findings thus contribute to the body of knowledge concerning the nature and characteristics of organisational structure and evolution.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/101</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical methods to evaluate school breakfast programs: a case study</field><field name="creator">Miller, P. Wayne</field><field name="description">This study reports the use of empowerment evaluation with a national school breakfast program in Australia known as the Good Start Breakfast Club (GSBC).The project comprised two key aspects. First, the empowerment evaluation (Fetterman, 2001) approach was used as the framework to develop a &#8216;practical&#8217; methodology desired by the program managers (Australian Red Cross) and major sponsor (Sanitarium Health Food Company at the time of the study) to evaluate their program. Good Start Breakfast Club personnel engaged in a process of self-evaluation and, in so doing, a suite of &#8216;practical&#8217; evaluation tools was developed. During the application of empowerment evaluation the researcher served as facilitator and evaluation &#8216;coach&#8217;, offering evaluation expertise throughout the process. Second, the impact that empowerment evaluation has had on the delivery of the GSBC program is reported in this case study. These impacts were examined at two main levels: first on the capacity of program personnel to contribute to the evaluation, and second on changes that occurred in relation to program delivery as a result of the empowerment evaluation.Eighty Good Start Breakfast Club personnel took part in ten empowerment evaluation workshops during 2005 to: identify key program activities for investigation; gather baseline data about the strengths and weaknesses of the activities; suggest goals and strategies to monitor and improve the activities identified; and to develop evaluation tools designed to provide evidence of success.The empowerment evaluation approach was successful in generating a high level of cooperation and commitment from workshop participants to the on-going evaluation process. It was also effective in building evaluation capacity in the relatively short period of the study with participants reporting having had their knowledge and understanding of participatory program evaluation enhanced. Nine evaluation instruments were trialled during 2006 with respect to four key program activities: providing a healthy breakfast to children in greatest need; positively changing or influencing the eating habits of children; improving the learning capacity/learning environment of children attending the GSBC; and social interaction in the GSBC environment.The research project makes a significant contribution to the field of evaluation practice on at least two fronts. First, early versions of the case study have contributed to the professional field of program evaluation with presentations made at three international conferences of the Australasian Evaluation Society, one at the annual conference of the American Evaluation Association and a paper published in the Evaluation Journal of Australasia. It is advancing knowledge about a contemporary program evaluation approach and about a community-based program of significant public interest in Australia. Second, evaluation methods and associated tools were prepared and implemented at trial sites by non-specialist program personnel in preparation for widespread use across the Good Start Breakfast Club program. Three survey instruments were subsequently rolled out across the program in three Australian states. It is envisaged that the findings of this study and the results derived from the on-going evaluation of the Good Start Breakfast Club, while of particular significance to the program&#8217;s sponsors, will be applicable to sponsors of school breakfast and other community-based programs throughout the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3059</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of conducting polymers for separations</field><field name="creator">Reece, David Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of a range of novel conducting polymer materials with potential applications in the area of separations. Both polypyrroles and polyanilines are examined. Following a General Introduction and an Experimental Chapter, the new studies are described in Chapters 3 to 7. In Chapter 3 it is shown that polypyrrole doped with either &#61665;-cyclodextrin sulfate (&#61665;-CDS) or &#61666;-cyclodextrin sulfate (&#61666;-CDS) is readily deposited electrochemically. Electrodeposited polypyrrole has been characterised using UV-Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, AFM, SEM, microanalysis, and electrical conductivity measurements.This electrodeposited polypyrrole can easily be prepared as a composite membrane (with Pt-coated PVDF) for use in metal ion transport experiments. Transport of metal ions across PPy.&#61666;-CDS is shown to be significantly greater than across PPy.&#61665;-CDS, and also greater than that previously observed with related polypyrroles. However, the increased flux results in a loss in the selectivity that the membrane shows between different metal ions. Chapter 4 describes a novel electroless polymerisation of pyrrole in the presence of the sulfonated calixarene, calix[6]arene-4-sulfonic acid (C6S). A solution containing pyrrole and C6S undergoes a slow polymerisation reaction in the absence of any added chemical oxidant or electrochemical oxidation. A specific host-guest interaction between pyrrole and C6S is thought to be an important part of the reaction mechanism. The product of this reaction is an insulating black powder. However, it is electroactive and exhibits spectral features similar to conducting polypyrroles and is doped with C6S. On the basis of the obtained data, a structure consisting of small conducting regions of polypyrrole isolated by insulating pyrrolidine and ring-opened products is proposed. The addition of polymeric stabilisers such as poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(vinyl pyrrolidinone) or poly(styrene sulfonate) results in the formation of stable colloidal dispersions of the polypyrrole. The interaction of polyaniline and some biological phosphates (particularly adenosine- 5&#8242;-triphosphate (ATP)) is reported in Chapter 5. When ATP is included as a dopant during the electrosynthesis of polyaniline, highly optically active films with chiral anisotropy factors as high as 1.9 % are obtained. It is believed that this optical activity arises from interactions between hydrogen- and ionic-bonding sites of the ATP dopant with the amine nitrogen (NH) and radical cation (+&#8226;NH) centres on the polyaniline chains. These highly optically active polyaniline films retain their optical activity upon de-doping, re-doping, oxidation and reduction. Initial investigations into potential applications for these polyanilines show that the release of ATP from the polymers cannot be electrochemically or pH controlled; and no chiral discrimination towards 10- camphorsulfonic acid is observed. The covalent attachment of a chiral substituent to nitrogen centres of polyaniline is examined in Chapter 6. 10-camphorsulfonyl chloride readily reacts with polyaniline emeraldine base in solution to form a weakly optically active emeraldine salt. This substituted polyaniline retains its optical activity in solution even upon alkaline dedoping. However, optical activity is lost upon oxidation and reduction. An analogous reaction can also be performed on leucoemeraldine base to form a virtually identical optically active emeraldine salt. Alternatively, a similar reaction on aniline monomer forms a substituted chiral monomer. However, this monomer cannot be polymerised, presumably due to the steric and/or electron withdrawing effects of the 10-camphorsulfonyl substituent. In the final chapter, Chapter 7, the induction of chirality into poly(2-methoxyaniline-5-sulfonic acid) (PMAS) via acid-base interactions with a range of chiral bases is investigated. Films evaporatively cast from aqueous solutions of PMAS mixed with alkaloids, amino acids or adenosine are all found to be optically active, confirming induction of chirality into the PMAS chains. The origin of this chiral induction is discussed on the basis of the chiroptical properties of the PMAS.Chiral Base species obtained.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/366</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the relationship between governance, decision-making, and school effectiveness: a case study of four high schools</field><field name="creator">Mohajeran, Behnaz</field><field name="description">The Purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between governance, decision-making, and particular indicators of school effectiveness: parental involvement, professional development of teachers, planning and budgeting, facilities and resources and student outcomes. The study focused on the Principal, teachers, parents, and students of four high schools in the Wollongong area of NSW. The schools represented different governance arrangements: one government; one independent Catholic; one independent Christian parent-controlled; one Catholic systemic. Each school represented a case study in which was applied mixed-method research utilising quantitative and qualitative approaches including questionnaire, semi-structured interview and document review.The results indicate similar approaches to and constraints on governance/decisionmaking across the four schools. An apparent relationship between type of governance and school effectiveness was not established. Different governance structures were not shown to have major impact on different school effectiveness indicators.However, a clear finding was that the Principal is central to the management and direction of decision-making in the school more so than any factors or differences there may be in other aspects of governance. It is not just the structural and hierarchical aspects of the Principal&#8217;s role that is important, but how he or she directs and manages school governance.The centrality of the Principals in these schools, the way they perceived and enacted their roles both generally and in relation to the roles of other stakeholders, and their participation in school decision-making, were thus critical in the governance of their schools.The findings of this study, as of other studies, were inconclusive on relationships between other structural governance factors and school effectiveness indicators, and suggest that the Principal's impact on such indicators as student outcomes may be significant but indirect. The study findings do, however support other findings on the importance of the Principal's role &#8211; their perception of it and the roles of others related to it, their personal and professional capabilities, and the extent to which they lead and involve others collaboratively in school governance and decision-making.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/173</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Magneto-optical imaging in superconductors</field><field name="creator">Roussel, Marie</field><field name="description">Knowing the magnetic flux behavior in a superconducting material is essential for a better understanding of the superconductivity phenomenon. The magneto-optical imaging (MOI) technique is one of the few techniques enabling the real time study of the local magnetic flux behavior in superconductors. This work had several aims: &#8226; Firstly, an efficient MOI system enabling the study of superconducting samples at liquid helium temperatures had to be set up to replace the former limited MOI system in ISEM (Institute for Superconducting and Electronic Materials). Indeed, the former MOI equipment was equipped with a cryostat cooled down via a cryocooler in which functioning principle was based on Joule-Thomson cycles of helium gas. This system had two main limitations: it only made it possible to reach temperatures down to 20 K, and it induced strong mechanical vibrations in the sample holder. These limitations had very disadvantageous consequences for the MOI study of superconducting samples: Some phenomenon such as dendritic flux jumps occurring in MgB2 below 10 K could not be studied. In addition, due to the mechanical vibrations, the sample and the magneto-optically active layer had to be strongly pressed on the sample holder in order to maintain them in place. This mounting pressure induced mechanical stress in the magneto-optically active layer, reducing the accuracy and quality of the magneto-optical images obtained with this system. To overcome these limitations, another MOI cryostat was installed. The latest cryostat is cooled down with liquid helium, eliminating the mechanical vibration and enabling the study of superconducting sample at temperatures down to 1.5 K. Due due the numerous differences between the two cryostat, numerous parts of the MOI equipment had to be changed or redesigned. The vacuum system iv was rearranged to enable us to recover the helium gas after its passage through the cryostat. The positioning system was adjusted to the new geometry of the latest cryostat. A new ring magnet was conceived and built to increase the intensity and homogeneity of the supplied magnetic field. The temperature control system was replaced. Finally, extra wires were positioned in the new cryostat to supply current to the sample and allow the study of superconductors under a transport current. All these modifications combined with the advantages of the liquid helium cooled cryostat mentioned earlier have enabled the acquisition of higher quality magneto-optical images and enhanced the reproducibility of the results. &#8226; Secondly, two computer programs were designed to enable the calibration of the local magnetic flux density and the quantification of the local current density from the magnetooptical images. The calibration of the grey levels of magneto-optical images into local magnetic flux densities is now possible by using an original user-friendly software. The quantification of flux density can now be done in two different manners: a pixel-by-pixel method or an averaging-pixel-cluster method. In the former, a unique calibration curve is calculated for each pixel of the pictures, while the later uses the averaged light intensity of a cluster of pixels for calibration. Although more rigorous than the averaging-pixel-cluster method, the pixel-by-pixel method is very time-consuming and thus can only be used on small areas of the pictures. In addition, a second computer program has been implemented for the quantification of the current density in a superconducting sample. This program can be used on any thin film samples and provides both current density maps and current flow contour plots (to visualize the flow direction of the current) from the calibrated MOI pictures. &#8226; Thirdly, both MOI setups have been used to study samples of the three most promising superconducting materials in terms of potential applications: MgB2, YBCO (YBa2Cu3O7) and Bi-2223 (Bi1.72Pb0.34Sr1.85Ca1.99Cu3Ox). MgB2 thin films prepared by pulsed laser deposition with different processing parameters have been compared to help us understand the influence of the film morphology on the magnetic flux penetration behavior. The microstructure of the film was found to strongly influence the pinning properties and the magnetic flux penetration. This influence is espev cially visible when partial flux jumps invade the films in the form of dendrites at low fields and temperatures. Under these conditions, the formation of abrupt dendritic avalanches appears to be structurally driven. The influence of the magnetic iron sheath on the flux and current distribution in the superconducting core of MgB2/Fe sheathed wires have also been investigated. Global magnetic measurements indicated that the iron sheath shields the superconducting core from the external magnetic field, improving its current carrying capabilities at low fields. A local study of the current distribution in the MgB2 core done with the MOI technique has revealed a redistribution of the supercurrents, although no overcritical currents (currents with a density greater than the critical current density) were observed. YBCO thin films were studied in order to gain more insight into the effects of the film morphology on the magnetic behavior. Samples produced with various techniques and with different microstructures have been visualized with the MOI technique. A key conclusion from this work is that a smooth film surface generally leads to higher critical current density. Furthermore, a comparison of critical current density in mono- and multilayer YBCO films produced by pulsed laser deposition shows the beneficial effect of the multilayer deposition method, especially for the use of YBCO thin films at low temperatures. Finally, by studying a set of Bi-2223 tapes with MOI and various material characterization techniques, optimal sintering conditions for their processing have been identified. The temperature and cooling conditions of the last heat treatment were proved to be two critical factors determining the current carrying capabilities of Bi-2223 multifilamentary tapes though a complex interplay of Bi-2223 phase formation and crack healing processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/16</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary maritime pressures and their implications for naval force structure planning</field><field name="creator">McLennan, Bruce Clark</field><field name="description">The contemporary determinators of Australia&#8217;s naval force structure are generally derived from threat based calculations as modelled through scenario focused exercises. Analysis, future capability development, and force structure planning, are principally configured for high-intensity war-fighting roles against a similarly sophisticated enemy, in the defence of the Australian mainland&#8212;in the belief that forces structured for the defence of Australia and its approaches can meet all the tasks asked of it by the Government. The underlying assumption is that geostrategic imperatives should shape strategy as well as force structure. The focus remains firmly affixed to &#8216;contest&#8217; and the assertion of strategic security to the determent of constabulary control. It also drives the tendencies for &#8216;bigger/brighter and more gigabytes&#8217; that lead to the unsatisfiable demands in defence expenditure and the over-specification of required capability. This thesis argues that a historical trend analysis offers a further dimension in appreciating naval force structure emphasis, claiming that there are at least three contemporary pressures that should be exerting influence on a nation&#8217;s naval planning&#8212;these pressures are maritime geopolitical evolution through a dominant sea power hypothesis, the asymmetric response to technology that has changed the character of warfare, particularly at sea, and the inevitable progression of ocean exploitation and enclosure that has dawned the modern era in oceans governance. All three forces are applying their pressure in a similar direction&#8212;away from the traditional ship-of-war, towards the ship-of-law and the ship-of-expedition over the shore. To argue this thesis there are three supporting suppositions: The first supposition contends that we have entered the era of Pax Americana&#8212;an era of unchallenged maritime supremacy. Like the eras of Pax Romana and Pax Britannica before it, with Pax Americana ruling the oceans and guaranteeing the freedom of navigation, there is now an emergent need to shift the balance of force structure away from those naval forces that are needed to fight for the control of the seas&#8212;combat and contest&#8212;and towards those naval forces that are going to use the sea control given to them&#8212;regulation and utilisation. The second, that the character of warfare has changed: that conventional warfare has moved to the Third World. Yet the modern ship-of-war is at the forefront of technological development and the product of a nation&#8217;s technical ability and resource. It is designed to fight against a similarly sophisticated enemy; against a platform that resembles itself in technical sophistication. It is also a weapon of statecraft, as only States can afford the infrastructure and costs to support them. If conventional warfare has indeed moved to the Third World, then it has also moved against States that do not have the technical skills and resource base to support the modern warship&#8212;the traditional ship-of-war no longer has an equally sophisticated enemy. The third, that the modern practise of State sovereignty expansion and ocean enclosure that has dawned the modern era of ocean governance is a fundamental evolution in ocean usage. It is now being reflected in, or by, the increased awareness of, and emphasis on, &#8216;constabulary tasking&#8217; such as resource management, environmental protection, immigration regulation, quarantine inspection and trans-national crime enforcement&#8212;the demand for a ship-of-law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/604</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supporting the use of learning objects in the K-12 environment</field><field name="creator">Cotton, Wayne Grant</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been an international agenda to make electronic resources, in the form of learning objects, freely available to teachers and students via on-line databases or repositories. To date, much of the work on these resources has focused on the development of learning objects and the technical aspects of the storage and retrieval processes. Less attention has been paid to the way the learning objects are disseminated and how teachers incorporate the objects into teaching and learning activities. Several researchers (Bennett, Lockyer, &amp; Agostinho, 2004; Hand et al., 2004; Kang, Lim, &amp; Kim, 2003; Koper, 2001b; Laurillard &amp; McAndrew, 2003; Lukasiak et al., 2004; Wiley, 2003) suggest that using generic pedagogical frameworks, known as learning designs, may support teachers who wish to make use of these learning objects. This research study sought out to investigate these claims by designing, developing and evaluating a support system to aid K-12 teachers as they attempt to incorporate learning objects into learning designs. The theories underlying this support system approach are linked to Vygotsky&#8217;s (1978) concept of the zone of proximal development and the notion of scaffolding to assist a learners in making progress on tasks that would otherwise be out of their reach (Davis &amp; Linn, 2000; Edelson, Gordin, &amp; Pea, 1999; Quintana, Eng, Carra, Wu, &amp; Soloway, 1999; Reiser, 2002). Using these ideas as a base it was theorised that a cognitive tool in the form of an Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) could provide the necessary scaffolding to aid teachers through the process of integrating learning objects within pedagogically effective frameworks (i.e., learning designs). The specific learning design used in this study was a WebQuest. This framework was selected because WebQuests are widely known within the K-12 community (Dodge, 1995) and because WebQuests require the use of online resources (i.e., learning objects). To investigate the integration of learning objects within a learning design, a research approach that could encompass the design, development and evaluative nature of the study was needed. One such approach that has been proven to solve similar broad based, complex, real world problems, while at the same time maintaining a commitment to theory construction and explanation, is Reeves&#8217; development research model (Reeves, 2000; Reeves, Herrington, &amp; Oliver, 2004). Using the development research procedures outlined by Reeves, this study initially involved a needs analysis to identify the issues that K-12 teachers faced when they attempted to incorporate learning objects within a specific learning design. Considering the findings from the needs analysis with current peer reviewed literature, a series of design principles were generated. These principles were then used to inform the design, development and testing of a web-based EPSS. The findings of the study suggest that when K-12 teachers attempt to incorporate learning objects within a learning design they face issues in four main areas: 1) limitations in their own technological competency when developing WebQuests; 2) issues relating to how teachers manage the time available to create WebQuests; 3) difficulties in searching for and identifying appropriate learning objects; and 4) maintaining the pedagogical quality within the learning designs. The web-based EPSS developed in this study addressed these issues by supporting the teachers as they incorporated learning designs into their teaching and learning experiences. The EPSS accomplished this by combining specific information, guidance, online tutorials, and a range of pedagogically effective learning design taxonomies into an all encompassing support structure. The study revealed that there are still more opportunities to develop the support system further, particular in relation to managing the time taken to develop WebQuests and to maintaining the pedagogical quality of the teaching and learning experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/443</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of collegiality in the professional development of principals</field><field name="creator">Armour, Lenore</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a case study of the nature of collegiality and how it was established and sustained by a peer-support group of Australian principals over a period of seventeen years as a result of their participation in a Commonwealth Schools Commission professional development course designated as a Project of National Significance. The major research question was as follows: &#8216;How did the involvement of a group of principals in a collegial-based leadership program contribute to their professional development and social, and emotional well-being?&#8217; The researcher has been a participant in the group from its inception. The case study was constructed from historical and contextual data collected through an analysis of education documents and group artefacts, such as faxes, diaries and photographs, through interviews with key stakeholders such as course designers, consultants and through the use of data from a questionnaire on the concept of collegiality and its sustainability. Contemporary data were collected through individual interviews with the participants in the peer-support group and through participant constructed narratives. Propositions about the nature and changing conditions of collegiality, as experienced by participants in the group, which were derived from an analysis of these data, were clarified through surveys and focus group interviews. As a result of this process of analysis, an &#8216;ideal type&#8217; of collegiality, captured by the concept of coadunation, was depicted as a model. Structural, behavioural/attitudinal and cultural conditions of collegiality were identified as operating through four stages of the changing group purpose. Some conditions of collegiality were found to have been sustained over a period of seventeen years while others gradually disappeared according to the professional and personal needs of the group. A significant outcome of the case study is the evidence that professional development, based on the central notion of a collegial community of peers, provided the conditions that empowered principals to use reflection, action research and problemsolving strategies in their own learning. This model of professional development was paramount in assisting the principals to achieve their professional goals and enhanced their personal development of attitudes and behaviours that supported collegial practices. In addition, the collegial group, which endured beyond the original training course, played a central role in promoting the welfare of the principals, through their access to a group of supportive, non-judgmental peers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/446</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital rights management for smart containment objects</field><field name="creator">Fares, Tony Yussef</field><field name="description">Copyright law has been created to satisfy a variety of objectives including promoting knowledge in communities and encouraging authors and content producers to create more content. Originally, copyright measurements were proposed as means of controlling access to content. Over time, they have been defined as the degree of control authors or distributors can exercise over their works. Technologists and smart-device manufacturers identified such new rights management market, and invented new encryption algorithms and devices with the belief that technical solutions alone could provide full content protection. A clear differentiation must be drawn between the actual and expected results of rights management technologies. These technologies may reduce unauthorized content access, but cannot fully protect content. This is because security devices may be circumvented and security solutions may be attacked through their weakest point.Further research about copyright management revealed that this is not a new concept.  Copyright issues and infringements have already been in existence in different shapes and forms since the pre-digital age. The growth in Internet use led to the definition of a new form of rights management known as Digital Rights Management (DRM). DRM is defined as the management of intellectual property exchanged in digital form. DRM, after more than twenty years since information digitization started, is still considered by most businesses as complex, expensive, and hard to adopt. Most content anagement businesses perceive DRM automation as an unnecessary step since it may increase complexities and costs in communications with other peers, suppliers, or customers. DRM is complex for a variety of reasons and one of the major contributors to the complexity is the lack of standardization among various DRM products available on the market today.Given such DRM complexity, this dissertation has been developed to include objectives that address two main aspects of DRM: First, providing a comprehensive, yet simple, definition of DRM. This has been achieved through the definition of a DRM framework called the Holistic Rights Framework (HRF), which covers social, legal, and echnological facets of DRM and their relationships. HRF is intended to provide a useful model that can be used as a reference by anyone interested in or impacted by copyright legislation. The HRF may provide additional benefits for technologists through better understanding of legal and social factors and implications related to DRM, thus resulting in better-designed products with the possibility of higher consumption or usage.Second, this dissertation addresses one example of the HRF technical facet: the integration of Rights Expression Language (REL) and Content Packaging. This section describes how an extension to a REL (i.e. XrML) and Content Packaging (i.e. IMS Content Packaging) has been achieved. The result is a set of methods or APIs that can be invoked as a web service to manage rights across containment objects. Those APIs may also be invoked by rendering application-toquery rights before rendering content. Such rights management and control over the smallest sub-object in each containment object preserve authors&#8217; rights and encourage them to produce more. This concept contributes to digital objects&#8217; re-use and helps in preserving owners&#8217; rights over their creation when they are exchanged or organized as part of a containment object. It also helps consumers by giving them the choice to access only the information they want rather than accessing the whole containment object, thus costing less. In addition, it is complemented with a few examples illustrating its applicability and usage in real life. Those examples cover how a user or an object may automatically query or set rights across a containment object using the developed API. A proof of this concept has been achieved through the development and delivery of a set of APIs and demonstrators capable of invoking various DRM-related methods on a containment object.The contribution to knowledge by this research is summarized in two main areas: 1) conceptual; through the new definition of a DRM framework with the intention to increase awareness among various DRM stakeholders towards DRM facets; and 2) technical; through integrating REL and Content Packaging that preserves content producers&#8217; rights and encourages them to produce more.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/474</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regolith geochemical exploration in the Girilambone District of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Ackerman, Benjamin R.</field><field name="description">This study examines the distribution of geochemical elements in the surficial and regolith profile environments, about two copper sulfide deposits in the Girilambone district of New South Wales. Multi- lement geochemical and mineralogical investigations of regolith, rock and mineralised samples from the Larsens East and Hartmans prospects of Girilambone North and the Tritton copper deposits, were conducted to determine the geochemical expression of  ineralisation and mechanisms of geochemical dispersion within the regolith environment. Host metasedimentary units and intrusive mafic rocks can be discriminated geochemically at various levels within the regolith and primary environments, particularly on the basis of REE geochemistry and several other key elements, thus establishing a &#8216;background&#8217; geochemical variance of non-mineralised lithologies. Geochemical data were examined within a regolithlandform context, following investigations of regolith architecture and development, which identified two prominent regolith-landform examples within an otherwise lowrelief, erosional regime. At Girilambone North,  weathering of greater intensity has developed a moderately ferruginised upper regolith and poorly developed &#8216;lateritic&#8217; profile, resulting in preservation of surface regolith horizons, while within the Tritton study area, upper regolith horizons have been partially truncated by erosive stripping, with residual soils developed directly on weathered saprolite. Each instance forms an individual case from a geochemical exploration viewpoint, for which strategies for further exploration have been developed. Primary Cu mineralisation within the Girilambone district occurs as massive  pyritechalcopyrite mineralisation within a pyritic envelope. Mineralisation is generally associated with intense silicification and may be associated with mafic volcanism and characterised by anomalously higher occurrence of the elements Sb, As, Bi, Br, Cd, Co, Cu, Au, Fe, Pb, Mo, Ni, Se, Sr, S, Te, Sn, W and Zn. At Girilambone North, primary mineralisation occurs within and below the extent of regolith development, and secondary mineralisation has formed as laterally extensive secondary chalcocite, copper oxide and copper carbonate zones above the weathering front, which extends to approximately 90 m below the present land surface. Moderate surface ferruginisation has retained primary mineralised elements such as As, Bi, Ba, Co, Cu, Au, Hg, Mo, Ni, Ag, Te and Zn within the vicinity of primary mineralisation, while these elements are also enriched in soil geochemical analyses. Strong leaching due to acidic weathering solutions borne from oxidation of sulfide minerals, has formed a displaced geochemical anomaly to the north of known mineralisation in saprolite and soil samples, while these same media did not necessarily display anomalism directly above mineralised zones. Geochemical dispersion has been predominantly by hydromorphic dispersion and migration of groundwaters through north-trending late-stage faults and structural zones. This study also examines the surface geochemical expression of mineralisation over the concealed Tritton Copper deposit in regolith (at the time of sampling) relatively undisturbed by prior mining activities. It is in effect a retrospective study granted that the position of sulfide mineralisation at depth has been well defined by exploration and resource delineation drilling. Subtle multi-element geochemical anomalism coincident in residual soil and saprolite sampling, from this study and re-analysis of previous geochemical exploration data, has been identified at the up-plunge and up-dip extensions of Tritton mineralisation. Geochemical dispersion about the Tritton copper deposit is almost entirely mechanical, and limited to residual soils and saprolite regolith materials at the up-plunge and up-dip extension of concealed mineralisation. Coarsefraction residual soils show anomalous Sb, As, Cu, Au and lesser Bi, Cd, Mo and Zn in soil sampling traverses, and saprolite sampling displays a subtle multi-element As, Cu and Pb response. Erosive stripping of the upper regolith profile and relative resistance of host quartzite lithologies to weathering has resulted in geochemical anomalism of only limited extent at the surface level.A multi-element analysis approach and sampling of common regolith materials is recommended for further geochemical investigations of the regolith. Subtle geochemical associations are best identified by multi-variate data analysis methods, which when viewed spatially in conjunction with other geochemical, geophysical or geological information forms an effective approach to regolith geochemical exploration.The Girilambone district of New South Wales represents an area of relatively unexplored, yet potentially prospective, mineral wealth. Increased interest in the region has arisen from recent government research initiatives, renewed mining and exploration activities and rising commodity prices. The future of exploration for Girilambone-style mineralisation may depend heavily on regolith geochemical investigations, of which this study provides a timely account of two mineralised occurrences in the Girilambone district.Keywords: geochemical dispersion; regolith geochemistry; mineral exploration; multi-variate data analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/523</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abandoning the masculine domain of leadership to identify a new space for women's being, valuing and doing</field><field name="creator">Rodgers-Healey, Diann M</field><field name="description">Women continue to experience a range of barriers in the domain of leadership and have not as yet achieved equality or equity. An empirical and non-empirical literature review showed that the historic evolution of leadership theory and the practice of leadership are male dominated and masculinist with contemporary leadership bearing vestiges of gender prejudice creating systemic inequities for women.  Where research has been carried out into the area of women and leadership, this has consisted of exploring the barriers which women experience at all levels of organisations, how these barriers can be overcome and the effectiveness of women&#8217;s leadership style. However, this has invariably remained within the boundaries of masculinist leadership and has not resulted in achieving relative change for women even though strategies such as diversity and legislation to eradicate inequities against women in the workplace are being pursued.With the intent of capturing multiple realities of women and men who advocate for women&#8217;s empowerment, in relation to how they perceive and experience the phenomenon of leadership and explore what is possible for women, beyond the masculinist boundaries of leadership, this study using a constructivist, phenomenological, feminist and grounded theory approach invited ten Australian women leaders of different age and background and from different workplaces to abandon the arena of leadership to conceptually explore what lies outside it in terms of women&#8217;s being, valuing and doing. A grounded theory analysis of the findings of phase 1 interviews resulted in the model of co-existence and 20 principles which applied to a co-existential way of being for women and men. A corollary model of patriarchy explicating the forces that underpin contemporary society and opposing the development of co-existence also emerged.  The model of co-existence was refined in phase 2 when a grounded theory analysis of in-depth interviews with seven Australian women leaders and three Australian men leaders led to the development of an implementation plan for the model of co-existence in new and established organisations.  Surpassing contemporary diversity initiatives, the model moves beyond masculinism, feminism, and patriarchy, redefining leadership and shifting the focus from the inequitable disparity between the sexes to self-fulfilment for each person.  It is expected that further research of the model of co-existence in organisations will lead to additional refinement and validation as well as the creation of a discourse about co-existence and its potential to transform work and how we live.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/782</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study on undeniable signatures and their variants</field><field name="creator">Huang, Xinyi</field><field name="description">In an ordinary digital signature scheme, the verification of a signature requires the associated message, the signer&#8217;s public key and other public information (e.g. public parameter). Anyone in the system can verify the validity of the digital signature. This property is useful, as it has many applications. However, it is undesirable for some situations where signer&#8217;s privacy is a concern, especially in personally and commercially sensitive applications. In this thesis, we investigate several special signature schemes that accommodate the signer privacy.In undeniable signatures, the most distinctive feature is that the signer is able to choose who can be convinced about his/her undeniable signature, as the validity of an undeniable signature can only be verified in collaboration with the signer. The property selective convertibility enables the signer to convert one or more undeniable signatures into ordinary digital signatures at some time later, while one can make all his/her undeniable signatures publicly verifiable in an undeniable signature scheme with universal convertibility. Undeniable signatures with selective and universal convertibility have found many applications in practice such as keeping digital records of confidential political decisions. However, the most known constructions bear a long signature length and some schemes can only be proven secure under strong complexity assumptions. In this thesis, we describe a new undeniable signature scheme with selective and universal convertibility, of which the signature length is the shortest among all comparable ones and the security can be reduced to weaker complexity assumptions. This scheme is considered in the traditional public key infrastructure, where the authenticity of a user&#8217;s public key is ensured by certificates. We also provide the first selectively and universally convertible undeniable signature scheme where a user&#8217;s public key is his/her identity.Designated verifier signatures bridge the gap between ordinary digital signatures and undeniable signatures, in the sense that they will limit who can be convinced by the signer&#8217;s signature without any collaboration with the signer. The designated verifier can be chosen by the signer in the generation of designated verifier signatures. Although the verification of a designated verifier signature usually needs only public information, only the designated verifier can believe that the designated verifier signature has been generated by the signer. This is due to the fact that the designated verifier is able to generate designated verifier signatures which are indistinguishable from those produced by the signer. Strong designated verifier signatures provide a higher level of privacy, as anyone cannot even verify the validity of strong designated verifier signatures with public information. All known constructions of strong designated verifier signatures have a relatively long signature length and require costly operations, which affect the overall performance of the system. In this thesis, we present two new constructions of strong designated verifier signatures, in traditional public key infrastructure and in identity-based cryptography, respectively. Both schemes have high computational efficiency, short signature length and provable security in the random oracle model.We finally consider universal designated verifier signatures, which can be viewed as an application of the general idea of designated verifier signatures. This notion was introduced to address the user privacy issue in certification systems, where a certificate holder (or more generally, a signature holder) wishes to generate a proof which can prove to a designated verifier his/her possession of the certificate, but does not want anyone else to be convinced. Universal designated verifier signatures achieve this by giving the designated verifier the full ability to generate that proof. The conviction thus is no longer transferable. In this thesis, we revise the notion of non-transferability in universal designated verifier signatures and give a new definition, which is meaningful both in theory and in practice. Our analysis, however, shows that not all existing schemes have that property. We describe a new universal designated verifier signature scheme, which can be proven secure without random oracles and has the property of non-transferability defined in this thesis. This thesis also investigates another property &#8220;delegatability&#8221;, which was previously believed as an inherent flaw in universal designated verifier signatures. We show that this problem can be overcome by proposing the first universal designated verifier signature scheme without delegatability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/788</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parental communication and involvement with young drivers</field><field name="creator">Papakosmas, Mary</field><field name="description">This research aims to contribute to young driver safety strategies by focussing on the role of parents, that is, their influence on and communication with novice drivers. In the ongoing efforts to address the issue of young driver safety, parents are a vital resource as, in the majority of cases, they assume the role of supervising driver when their children formally obtain a learner&#8217;s permit. A qualitative methodology was adopted in order to effectively gather data and explore the issues. A series of focus groups was conducted to document the experiences of parents and the sons and daughters they were teaching to drive. The study found parents modelled negative behaviour in the years leading up to the learner&#8217;s permit and during the learning phase, which conflicted with the safe driving habits they attempted to teach the novice. Parents&#8217; efforts to communicate with young drivers about safety were largely unsuccessful. Research findings also highlighted parental teaching issues, specifically confidence and competence. In terms of young drivers, the research found dissonance in relation to two areas: when under parental supervision they drove with less risk than when driving solo or with peers; and the safety information they admitted needing was different to indications they gave their parents. They also had poor driving competence after licensing, yet regarded their licence as a major social milestone which, when reached, gave them a strong sense of maturity and independence. The findings are discussed in terms of their application to social marketing theory&#8217;s principle of positive behaviour change for social benefit. This discussion highlighted a number of practical interventions designed to promote safe driving practices among novice drivers.  The interventions utilize both upstream and downstream strategies.  They include enhancing driver training and testing in order to address skill and behaviour deficiencies, interventions to address parental driving behaviour, and support for parents as driving teachers.  Finally, the implications for further research are also addressed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/793</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composition : pure data as a meta-compositional instrument</field><field name="creator">Barkl, Michael L.G</field><field name="description">The aim of &#8220;Composition: Pure Data as a Meta-Compositional Instrument&#8221; was to compose a folio of original electronic pieces that used Miller Puckette&#8217;s open source program Pure Data (Pd) as a &#8220;meta-compositional instrument&#8221;: that is, as a vehicle for documenting the creative process in a graphical way as a type of analytical notation.

The central questions at the heart of this  examination involve, on the one hand, interrogating the constmction of home, belonging, and thus nation, as heteronormative, and, on the other hand, adjudicating between the claim made by some queer Canadian scholars that Canada is a queer nation and the assertion, made by other lesbian and gay scholars, that Canada is too heteronormative to allow for the development of a queer public culture. At the same time, postcolonial and anti-racist approaches to issues of Canadian identity and belonging suggest that race and ethnicity remain crucial sites around which competing discourses of the public sphere are mobilized. Particularly when issues of racial, ethnic or indigenous identity are broached in conjunction with sexually dissident identities, questions of queer alterity serve both to problematize and to interrogate the ways in which it is possible to think about what it means to call Canada home.This thesis approaches these issues in several ways. It attempts to locate the social and cultural faulthnes, both in populist texts and in queer cultural works, that reveal the contested and contestatory constitutionof queemess bothas belonging and as not belongjng wit&#237;iinthe Canadian body politic, in part by looking at two examples that serve as limit tests for both officiaJ and popular discourses of tolerance and multiculturalism &#8212; the legahzation of lesbian and gay marriage and the continued, and parhaps increasing, incidence of queer-bashing,  particularly in relation to tiie 2001 hate-motivated murder of Aaron Webster. However, following Richard Rorty's assertion that it is predominanfly narrative cultural texts, such as novels and films, that function "as the principal vehicles of moral change and progress," I concentrate predominantiy on narrative examples which both describe and critique the conditions tiiat, often incoherentiy, work to effect the exclusion of lesbian and gay Canadians &#8212; especially whenthose Canadians are also, to use RoyMiki's tema, racialized&#8212;fromthe public constmction of the nation. Using theoretical approaches predominantiy from tiie work of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Michel Foucault, Juditii Bufler, Lee Edelman, Elspe&#250;i Probyn, Paul Morrison, and Ann Cveticovich, I investigate the ways in which contemporary queer cultural production attempts, in Sedgwick's words, to disarticulate and disengage impacted social spaces, suchas family and nation, and to create "a practice of valuing flie ways in which meanings and institutions can be at loose ends with each oflier," a practice in which it is possible to understand flie ways in which normative discourses produce ways of fliinking about home, f&#248;mily and na&#250;onTn'wi&#250;ch.^everything means the same thing." Tbe critical, cuitural practices I examine include a variety of ways by which queer artists respond to the cultural faulflines tiiat regulate questions of visibility, representation, trauma and tiie creation of archives. I conclude by arguing that it is in tiie very disjuncture between competing discourses of Canada' s queemess and its heteronoraiativity fliat it is possible to assert queerly Canadian ontologies and epistemologies as public knowledges and ways of being that are always contingent and imcertain &#8212; and always urgenfly necessary.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1961</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attitudes of Kuwaiti companies towards using services of foreign auditors</field><field name="creator">Alduwaila, Nabi</field><field name="description">Usefulness of financial statements is related to the extent to which users can believe the accounting numbers.  This usefulness is enhanced if the statements are prepared in accordance with known rules which cannot be altered.  Auditing can provide this assurance.  This research aims at analyzing the attitudes of Kuwaiti companies towards using services of foreign auditors and tries to find out the impact of these services on the companies&#8217; performance, growth and profitability. This research also aims at finding out measures that Kuwaiti companies may need to take to enhance the quality of service acquired from foreign auditors.   It is suggested that organizations will request the assurance provided by auditors in order to demonstrate financial accountability.  This accountability is essentially an obligation to present an account of and answer for the execution of responsibilities to those who entrusted those responsibilities.This study collects data, through a survey, and uses a random sample of adequate size. To achieve its aims, the study applies sophisticated statistical techniques (Factor analysis, discriminant analysis, probit-logit regression analysis and multiple regression analysis) to the recent collected data.A Review of literature indicated that the decision of companies to use services of foreign auditors is affected by types of auditing, auditing philosophy, process and strategy.  It is also claimed that the decision to select a particular foreign auditor depends on the audit objectives, audit competence, independence and audit method. The cost of auditing services is also claimed to be an important factor in using services of foreign auditors. Despite the growing literature on various aspects of auditing, it appears that many gaps still exist in the current literature.  In particular, no attempt has been made to examine the reason for using services of a particular auditor by particular companies; no previous attempt was made to find out if it is possible to separate different organizations in their selection of particular auditors on the basis of some measurements (e.g. demographic variables); no empirical evidence exists on the effectiveness of the auditors&#8217; characteristics on the use of their services by particular companies; no attempt has been made to determine reasons for using foreign auditors by organizations in small developing economies or to determine the factors underlying foreign auditors&#8217; image in a small oil-producing economy also no research was done to determine the probability of using services of foreign auditors by organizations in a small developing country that lacks experienced local auditors. Most importantly, no attempt was made to assess the attitudes of companies operating in the State of Kuwait towards using services of auditors who operate outside their country.Chapter Three examines the structure of the Kuwaiti economy and its changes over the last three decades.  It also examines the structure of the Kuwaiti companies and the possibility of their adoption of international accounting standards. This structure covers the composition of the Kuwaiti population, labor force, basic social indicators, aggregate supply by economic sector and aggregate demand by type of expenditure, the public finance of the Kuwaiti economy the composition of Kuwaiti foreign trade and its balance of payments. It also analyzes the forms of Kuwaiti companies in general and Kuwaiti companies that are listed in the stock exchange and gives some ideas about the possibility of adoption of international accounting standards by Kuwaiti companies. The determination of sample size and collection of sample data needed to achieve the objectives of the thesis were assessed. The demographic variables of sample companies were examined and the companies&#8217; reasons for appointing a particular accounting auditor were analyzed. Moreover, the demands of sample companies for services of foreign auditors have been assessed and Kuwaiti companies&#8217; evaluation of the services offered by foreign auditors have been investigated.A two-group discriminant analysis has been applied to test for differences in the demographic profile of Kuwaiti companies and the characteristics of auditors that differentiate between Kuwaiti companies that use services of foreign auditors and Kuwaiti companies that do not. The results of the two-group discriminant analysis related to the impact of demographic variables suggest that  firms with relatively greater  assets , liabilities, smaller equity ratio, larger number of branches (local and overseas), greater connections with foreign sources, are eager to employ external auditors .The results of the two-group discriminant analysis related to the impact of the characteristics of accounting auditors indicate that companies which use services of foreign auditors attach great importance to reputation, performance, experience and qualifications of the auditors, while companies that do not use services of foreign auditors attach great importance to cost of auditing, past experience with non-foreign auditors, holistic advice and personal attention offered by auditors. Factor analysis is applied to determine Kuwaiti companies&#8217; attitudes towards services of foreign auditors.  Sample respondents were asked to indicate their degree of agreement about 20 statements regarding the importance of services offered by foreign auditors. Results of factor analysis suggest that there are four factors that motivate Kuwaiti companies for using services of foreign auditors. These factors are: company&#8217;s performance, achievement of operating facilities, growth and reputation.A multiple discriminant analysis has been applied to determine which of the factors predict Kuwaiti companies to use services of external auditors and to test if there are differences in the attitudes of Kuwaiti companies of various activities towards using these services. The statistical results are important in suggesting that there is a significant discrimination between the attitudes of Kuwaiti companies operating in the fields of agriculture, mining and quarrying; industrial production; banking, finance and insurance and various services, towards the importance of services of foreign auditors in the areas of reputation, performance, operation facilities and growth.The logit and probit regression analyses were used to model the decision as to whether Kuwaiti companies that do not currently use services of foreign auditors would use this service in the future. The analysis is based on the data collected through the survey that is based on the random sample of 385 Kuwaiti companies. It indicates that 260 companies do not use services of foreign auditors. The results suggest that age of company, value of liabilities, value of assets and number of branches is important factors in deciding whether to use services of foreign auditors in the future. There seems to be a negative relationship between the age of the company and the probability of using services of a foreign auditor. Recently established companies have a higher probability of accepting to deal with a foreign auditor. The value of liabilities has a strong positive effect on this probability. Also, the increase in the number of branches increases the probability of dealing with foreign auditors. The value of gross revenue seems to exert a slight positive influence on the decision to use services of foreign auditors, while the number of employees does not seem to exert a significant influence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/69</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visibility 600 metres: reflections on the national monuments of the Turkish republic of Northern Cyprus</field><field name="creator">Adil, Mehmet</field><field name="description">This Creative Arts doctoral project has engaged visual arts practice and academic investigation of national monuments in North Cyprus as complementary kinds of research via an exploration of material memory in relation to objects in the everyday surroundings.With regard to the decades-old intercommunal dispute in Cyprus, indications are that there are enduring habits of representation that both signal and participate in the non-resolved nature of the situation. Without the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot groups establishing for themselves the links of interdependency between how they represent each other and how they represent their own identities to themselves, they have yet to be fully engaged with respect to the history of antagonistic differentiation that they have participated in. The monumental commemorative forms in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are approached as visual elements in the everyday environment, ordinary yet extraordinary as objects condensed out of the flux of events, culture, memory, and experience in an interplay of the visible and the invisible. In this context it is proposed that Turkish Cypriot history be seen as a discursive interplay of presence and absence, where the subject is the people themselves, in which the national monuments began to appear at a particular point in time and continue to do so both as symbolic and concrete form and counterform in an on-going discourse. The visual arts practice stream of the research involved enquiry into ways of seeing and habits of thought in responding to the immediate surroundings. The artist&#8217;s own registering processes and thoughts became included as subjects of the explorations, in acknowledgement of a kind of dialectic involving personal (inner) and public (outer) space. In this art practice, the process of realisation and the realised object are active together in the social realm with simultaneous awareness of the individuality of perception, memory, and cognition involved in the interactivity, and the responsibilities therein. During this project, considerable reciprocity developed between the artistic practice and the academic research. The project makes a contribution to the visual cultural history of the Turkish Cypriot community and of Cyprus more broadly. It may also indicate some avenues of further exploration in research practice in bringing together different ways or kinds of thinking including the visual and artistic.

I also focused on the basic and fundamental properties of un-doped MgB2 wires in different temperatures for comparison purpose. And finally I have proposed another new dopant which avoids some problems using carbohydrate in some aspects.Firstly, I have studied the effects of sintering temperature on the phase transformation, lattice parameters, full width at half-maximum (FWHM), strain, critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc) and resistivity (_) in MgB2/Fe wires. All samples were fabricated by the in situ powder-in-tube method (PIT) and sintered within a temperature range of 650&#8211;900 _C. I have showed that why I have taken such sintering temperature range by analyzing with differential thermal analysis (DTA). The increased FWHM and decreased Tc at low sintering temperature region suggested the smaller grain size and poor crystallinity. Strain values also higher at low sintering region. That&#8217;s why it was observed that wires sintered at low temperature, 650 _C, resulted in higher Jc up to 12 T. The best transport Jc value reached 4200 A cm&#8722;2 at 4.2 K and 10 T. This is related to the grain boundary pinning due to small grain size and poor crystallinity due to strain defects. On the other hand, wires sintered at 900 _C had a lower Jc in combination with better crystallinity due to higher Tc.The effect of carbohydrate doping on lattice parameters, microstructure, Tc, Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 of MgB2 has been studied. In this work I used malic acid, C4H6O5 as an example of 2 carbohydrates as an additive to MgB2. We have described the advantages of carbohydrate doping include homogeneous mixing of precursor powders, avoidance of expansive nanoadditives, production of highly reactive C, and significant enhancement in Jc, Hirr, and Hc2 of MgB2, compared to un-doped samples. The defects due to the C substitution into boron site lead to the enhancement of Hirr and Hc2. The decrease of a-axis lattice parameter and reduction of Tc indicates poor crystallinity due to C substitution. The microstructure was shown both for un-doped and doped samples which were well consistent with FWHM. The Jc for MgB2+30 wt% C4H6O5 sample was increased by a factor of 21 at 5 K and 8 T without degradation of self-field Jc due to C substitution into B sites.During the evaporation process of the C4H6O5 with B and solvent, freshly and highly reactive C is produced and C substitution for B can take place at the temperature same as the formation temperature of MgB2. By using this chemical route I again evaluated the doping effects of C4H6O5, from 0 to 30 wt% of the total MgB2, on the lattice parameters, lattice strain, amount of carbon (C) substitution, microstructures, weight fraction of MgO, critical temperature (Tc), critical current density (Jc), and irreversibility field (Hirr) of a MgB2 superconductor. The calculated lattice parameters show a large decrease in the aaxis lattice parameter for MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples from 3.0861(6) to 3.0736(1) &#197;, with even a 10 wt% addition. This is an indication of C substitution into boron sites, with the C coming from C4H6O5, resulting in enhancement of Jc and Hirr. Specifically, the Hirr of the MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples prepared by the chemical solution route reached around 7 T at 20 K, with a Tc reduction of only 1.5 K. In addition, the self-field Jc of the MgB2 + 3 C4H6O5 samples was only slightly reduced at an additive level as high as 30 wt%. The interesting thing I found here is maximum C-substitution and the maximum enhancement of all the superconducting parameters up to 10 wt% addition, after that the improvement rate is saturated. From these data I can claim 10 wt% addition is enough for maximum Csubstitution and enhancement of superconducting properties. However, residual oxygen after evaporation processing contributed to a large amount of MgO in our MgB2 + 30 wt% C4H6O5 samples. These problems can be further controlled by the amount of C4H6O5 additive or different evaporation temperatures.After the successful doping effects of C4H6O5 into MgB2, then I investigated the behaviour of C4H6O5 as a dopant with different sintering temperatures. All the samples were prepared by the chemical solution route. I report the carbon (C) substitution effects of MgB2 + 10 wt% C4H6O5 on the lattice parameters, critical temperature (Tc), upper critical field (Hc2), and irreversibility field (Hirr) as a function of sintering temperature in the range from 600 to 900 _C. The additive C4H6O5 as the C source resulted in a small depression in Tc, but significantly increased the C substitution level, and hence improved the Hc2 and Hirr performance at a low sintering temperature of 600 _C in conjunction with a short sintering period of 4 h. In addition, the low-temperature sintering process resulted in small grain size and higher impurity scattering compared to a pure MgB2 superconductor which promotes the flux pinning significantly.Very recently, I have chosen another solid hydrocarbon dopant named pyrene (C16H10) in to MgB2. There are few reasons behind this decision. Firstly we know all the carbohydrates consist of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O). During the 4 evaporation process of C4H6O5, I noticed that the MgO amount is gradually increased with increasing doping level. So our group suggests such special solid hydrocarbon without O content which may reduce the MgO content within the matrix. In this work, we report on significantly enhanced Jc in MgB2 superconductor that was easily obtained by doping with a hydrocarbon, highly active C16H10, and using a sintering temperature as low as 600 &#176;C. The processing advantages of the C16H10 additive include production of a highly active carbon C source, an increased level of disorder, and the introduction of small grain size, resulting in enhancement of Jc.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/90</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency in utilizing ICT infrastructure in developing countries: a case study of the Royal Thai Police's attitudes to the adoption of an image retrieval application for eyewitness identification</field><field name="creator">Vilasinee, Srisarkun</field><field name="description">One of the most important aspects of decision and policy making is the timely access to accurately and relevant information. At present the situation in some developing countries is that communication and exchange of information between the government agencies are still paper-based. It can often take weeks or months for one government agency to obtain the records it requires from another agency. The lack of communication between these agencies often results in duplication of efforts and inefficiencies. This lack of communication also means that agencies often produce more of the irrelevant albeit sophisticated information (such as the Statistics Division) than the essential information that is critical and actually needed by other agency for decision making. (World Bank report, 1998) In order to bring people into information society, to have access to information, it is crucial to have appropriate technology and applications that compatible with both old and new technologies&#8212;given that majority can not afford to keep up with new technologies being introduced everyday--as well as quality programming in indigenous languages, To create an information society in developing countries, we must first have knowledge of their past, understand their present. Only then participating in their future can be more probable and possible (Matsepe-Casaburri 1996) The overall aim of this study is to add value to the process of information sharing among the government departments in Thailand. It does this by analyzing the opportunity to integrate existing technology with the data available in existing databases and make it more valuable for future use. A case study of the Department of Local Administration, under the Ministry of Interior, and the Royal Thai Police Department is used to develop an understanding of how the utilization of data to a full extent can be beneficial in the government service. In Thailand, every Thai citizen is required to carry a national identity card. Personal data of each person such as date of birth, height, blood type, religion and occupation, including registered address and individual photograph image, are kept in the Central Registration Database Systems (CRDS). The CRDS is operated by the Department of Local Administration under the supervision of the Ministry of Interior. In order to maximize the benefits from this database, the CRDS is shared by other authorized government agencies. The Royal Thai Police Department is one of the government agencies that also share the information from the CRDS. Frequently, the individual registration database and photographs from CRDS are needed to support crime investigation. This research therefore, investigates how the Thai government could utilize the existing database system to aid in the crime investigation process. It then suggests an effective method of image retrieval to support police officers when searching criminal records from a Central Registration Database Systems.The research begins with an exploratory study of the use and sharing of information amongst the government agencies in developing countries. It examines the use of existing technology and how the Government uses technology to access information. There are two major objectives in this research. The first one addresses how value can be added to the present data in the existing system. The author chooses to focus on the area of crime investigation and evaluate two existing image retrieval methods, in order to determine the most suited one from crime investigation process in Thailand. The second objective is to examine and evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of the Thai police towards acceptance of IT usage in the crime investigation process. The results are then was compared with the literature on barriers to the adoption of IT and some of the more recently developed Technology Acceptance Models, which is also used to explain the findings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/97</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of novel high energy density cathode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries</field><field name="creator">Bewlay, Stephen L</field><field name="description">&#8220;Synthesis of Novel High Energy Density Cathode Materials for Lithium Rechargeable Batteries&#8221; summarises 4 years of research by Stephen L. Bewlay in ISEM at the University of Wollongong (UoW). A brief historical introduction is given to previous research &amp; understanding of Li battery cathode materials, with references to many published papers and resources.Lithium Ferrous Phosphate (LFP)  materials were prepared as Li battery cathode material and extensively intercompared. Our group was the first in the world to publish on formation of LFP from inexpensive precursors via spray pyrolysis &amp; hydrogelation/aerogellation. Detailed thermodynamic calculations by the author show why spray-pyrolysed LFP can exist in a normal atmosphere without danger of converting Fe2+ (Ferrous) into unwanted Fe3+ (Ferric) ions. Synchrotron XRD measured crystal lattice spacings of sol-gel &#8220;pure&#8221; (actually slightly carbon-enriched) and Ti-doped LFP, and XANES (X-Ray Absorbtion Near- Edge Scattering) was done on Fe K-band X-radiation to quantify subtle changes in the environment of LFP Fe ions at various stages of charge/discharge. HRTEM was used to show convincingly that carbon residues from sucrose tended to coat the outside of LFP crystallites, enhancing the surface conductivity of LFP powder grains. A calibration chart was  onstructed to allow estimation of actual wt.% levels of residual carbon from a simple, single DTA/TGA measurement.\Dependence of LFP electrical conductivity on temperature was measured for both pure and Mg-doped LFP samples between room temperature and 400 oC.LFP has been celebrated in scientific journal publications as being more people- and environment-friendly than LiCoO2, but it is proven experimentally by the author that it underachieves its theoretical energy density and instead usually achieves close to the existing LiCoO2 cathode paste capacities. This was despite use of sophisticated techniques such as sucrose-induced carbon enrichment &amp; hydrogel/aerogel methods.Vanadium Pentoxides (V2O5) from differing synthetic pathways (spray pyrolysis, aerogellation) were verified to be promising cathode pastes, with discharge capacities &gt;200 mAh/g &amp; capacity losses ~0.4%/cycle. Spray-pyrolysed V2O5 was particularly intriguing &#8211; having a near-perfect spherical shape and a mass density ~80% of crystalline V2O5.WS2 nanotubes were synthesized from ammonium tetrathiotungstate by a unique 2- step un-templated furnace technique, with dimensions verified by TEM and HRTEM. WS2 nanotubes electrode pastes yielded a discharge capacity of ~ 200 mAh/g, &amp; capacity loss ~ 0.2%/cycle.MoS2 nano-material was synthesized and demonstrated by SEM to have unique, porous, parallel nanolayers, a result corroborated by other published research. Attempts to synthesise FeS2 fortuitously resulted in a new synthesis method dubbed &#8220;solid state dilution&#8221;, yielding nano-magnetite (Fe3O4) powder with 1st discharge capacity ~302 mAh/g when used as anode material.Current-Voltage curves, Charge/Discharge capacity and cyclability were assessed for many materials, with suggestions for further research on the most promising.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/495</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some biochemcial studies on the human lens nucleus</field><field name="creator">Wei, Xiaojia</field><field name="description">Barrier16 formation has been shown to occur in the lens with age. It is important to understand the physiological changes in the lens that occur upon the formation of the barrier and their implication on the onset of cataract and presbyopia (old man&#8217;s eyes). In this study, three factors related to the formation of the barrier were investigated: diffusion rate changes in the lens nucleus, oxygen consumption and cholesterol compositional changes in the lens with age. A Franz Cell was used to measure the diffusion rate changes in the nucleus of the human lens. No significant differences in the rate of diffusion between young and old lenses could be detected with this technique. The role of protein sulphydryls as secondary oxygen consumers was also studied. It was shown that protein sulphydryls reacted readily with oxygen, suggesting that protein sulphydryls are a secondary O2-consumption system in the center of the lens. Mitochondria are the primary oxygen consumers in the lens. A technique for the quantification of cholesterol in lipid extracts was developed. Results obtained were comparable to published results using traditional methods. The concentration of cholesterol in the young human lens was found to be approximately 3-fold greater than that of the bovine, ovine and porcine lenses, and ~5 times greater x than in the gallinaceous lens. These differences were even more pronounced when an elderly human lens was examined. The nucleus of the human lens was found to have a higher level of cholesterol content than that in the cortex and the concentration of cholesterol also exhibited a significant increase with age in both nuclear and barrier regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/574</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of manganese and chromium on the selective oxidation of low carbon strip steels for tinplate applications</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Paton Ron</field><field name="description">The &#8216;edge defect&#8217; is a band of low reflectivity that occurs near the edge of batch annealed steels that have been tinplated. The tinplate product that contains this defect must be scrapped because of the poor aesthetical properties and the reduced corrosion resistance in the affected areas. This defect was known to be caused by surface precipitates formed during batch annealing of the steel strip substrate. This research aims to identify the surface precipitates and the factors that can be modified to reduce their formation in an effort to develop an alloying and/or processing strategy which eliminates the occurrence of the &#8216;edge defect&#8217;.In this investigation the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; was characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which demonstrated that surface MnCr2O4 spinel precipitates were responsible for the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; although two different oxides, (MnFe)O and MnCr2O4 spinel, were observed on the steel surface. The formation of the surface (MnFe)O and MnCr2O4 spinel was due to the selective oxidation of manganese and chromium during batch annealing. The effects of manganese, chromium and annealing temperature on selective oxidation were also investigated and it was found that the MnCr2O4 spinel precipitate size and distribution were directly affected by the content of the chromium in the steels. The higher the chromium content of the steel the coarser the surface MnCr2O4 spinel particles. The annealing temperature has a similar effect on the average size of the MnCr2O4 spinel. Within the range of this investigation the higher the annealing temperature the coarser the surface particle size.The surface precipitates across the width of industrial batch annealed steel strip were characterised using SEM and TEM which established that the diameter of the surface oxide precipitates decreased from the edge to the centre of the steel strip. However, for the steel strip which exhibits the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; the maximum size of the surface precipitates does not occur at the edge, rather about 20-100 mm from the edge. This has been interpreted as the result of the transition of internal selective oxidation to external selective oxidation suggesting that the steel sheet&#8217;s exhibiting the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; are exposed to relatively higher oxygen potentials.This investigation has identified that lowering the annealing temperature, reducing the chromium level in the steel and reducing the oxygen potential of the annealing environment will reduce the formation of the MnCr2O4 spinel. Therefore the &#8216;edge defect&#8217; may be reduced by modifying these parameters during tinplate production. The minimisation of this defect will reduce production costs and improve product consistency for tinplate production.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/700</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the use of GIS by public participants in environmental decision-making processes: a case study approach</field><field name="creator">McIntyre, Emma</field><field name="description">Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have traditionally been used by government agencies engaged in land use planning. As public participation in environmental decision-making has increased in recent times, so has use of Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS). This research addresses the current debate regarding PPGIS and its effects on public participants in environmental decision-making processes by comparing the &#8220;top-down&#8221; and &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approaches to providing participants with access to GIS. A set of criteria for evaluating these two approaches were developed and applied to two case studies: (1) Was the GIS information provided easy to use and/or interpret?; (2) Did the GIS assist the participant in their role or help them in any way?; (3) Did the GIS have an impact on decisions being made or opinions of participants?; (4) Were participants comfortable using GIS?; (5) Did the GIS meet the expectations of the participants?; (6) What were the most useful functions of the GIS?; and (7) Will participants be able to use GIS in future? The two case studies were based in the Illawarra region on the south-east coast of Australia. The Kiama Local Environment Plan (LEP) Review was a case study using the &#8220;top-down&#8221; approach, where a Community Panel of sixteen citizens of the Kiama municipality were provided with facilitated access to Kiama Council&#8217;s GIS data to propose a series of recommendations for inclusion in the new LEP. The Landcare Illawarra Community GIS Project was a case study in the &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; approach where members of Landcare groups in the Illawarra region were provided with GIS software, data and training to assist them to plan, conduct and evaluate their existing projects. The research found that participants in each case study found the GIS easy to use. Participants in the Landcare case study felt empowered by the GIS because they were able to input their own data, while empowerment of participants in the Kiama LEP Review was dependent on how the Community Panel was facilitated. GIS impacted on the planning decisions made by participants in both case studies. Participants in the Landcare case study who had hands on experience with the GIS, were comfortable with using the technology, gained familiarity with the software during a training course and quickly applied it to their own ends. The most useful functions for Kiama participants were framed in terms of how it assisted them to access the information they required, while Landcare participants noted many of the technical functions such as the ability to input data from a GPS, to calculate areas and to query data as the most useful functions. WebGIS sites were developed for each case study, but the lack of adequate feedback from webGIS users meant that the use of GIS by website participants could not be evaluated as part of this research. Also, while the Landcare case study participants have ongoing access to GIS, it is difficult to determine whether Landcare members will continue to use it given the current lack of technical support.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/721</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marginal analysis of a distribution model designed to increase the social welfare function of Medicare-funded diagnostic services</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Keith</field><field name="description">The pursuit of a more beneficial service mix in primary medical care is a worthwhile public goal. Public expenditure on diagnostic testing referred from general practice is a matter of public interest because of its potential benefit to the social welfare function. To realise this potential, interventions must first reflect the evidence-base for enhancing clinical quality and promote discretionary increases in certain interventions (Eddy 1994[b] p.817; Rodwin 2004 p. 1328; Starfield 1998 p.406; Van Weel &amp; Del Mar 2004 p.99). The effectiveness of primary care however is stratified by social class (Macinko, Starfield &amp; Shi 2007 p.121; Starfield 1998 p.411). Therefore, services must also take into consideration any access barriers for vulnerable social groups and demonstrate a positive commitment to addressing the imbalance (Starfield 1998 p.406).In practice, good clinical or scientific evidence alone is insufficient to achieve the optimum distribution of health services. The evidence must be matched by economic viability and sensitivity to the prevailing socio-political imperatives (Haas 2001 p.228; Van Der Weyden &amp; Armstrong 2004 pp.607-608). Planning should explicitly consider marginal opportunities for changes in the balance of costs and benefits (Haas et.al. 1997 p.81). The purpose of this study is to derive a model that levers redistribution of general practitioner-referred diagnostic services in favour of vulnerable social groups within Australia. The study operates within the boundaries of the dominant disease-state paradigm, because it focuses on systematically addressing nationally-prioritised epidemiological indicators for targeted populations. The derived model relies on intermediaries representing groupings of general practices to drive the redistribution. It establishes an environment of nominal risk for the Divisions of General Practice network, acting as intermediaries. In turn, the actual risk to the Australian Government as the purchaser is limited to public funding through the Medicare Benefits Schedule of general practitioner-referred medical imaging (Category 5 [excluding Group I5]) and pathology tests (Category 6). This is achieved by introducing a credit reserve ledger as a novel mechanism to track and reward Division performance. The ledger is a tool for the Australian Government to map the balance of benefits claimed on diagnostic services referred by general practitioners enrolled with each Division. Ledger balances depend on a separation of medical imaging and pathology items into three streams. The systematic streaming of items is according to whether they are over-, appropriately- or under-referred, according to the available evidence. The key for Divisions to draw on their credit reserve ledger is the proportionate uptake of the evidence-based target items by identified vulnerable social groups within their catchment. This is compared with a target level of activity set for these groups to establish a specific performance ratio for each financial period. The research design of this study tests the model&#8217;s effectiveness in the current health care environment, rather than its theoretical efficacy. The model acknowledges Australia&#8217;s current legislative and policy framework and its communities&#8217; over-arching socio-political imperatives. No presumptions are made about changing the Medicare Benefits Schedule or its predominant fee-for-service mode of delivery. The redistribution model is tested using a series of scenarios, and analysed in three parts. In the first part a macro-level analysis examines the net implications of the redistribution for the Australian Government, Divisions of General Practice and diagnostic providers as a whole across four different scenarios. In the second part, a meso-level analysis uses the existing Divisions&#8217; network in a further three scenarios. Normative projections are developed across categories of geographic dispersion for each of the given scenarios. Thirdly, a micro-level analysis examines the absolute values of projected credit reserves within the same scenarios as the meso-level analysis for each of the Divisions.The model results in a 0.02% increase in total tests with a 2.2% reduction in the total of benefits claimed. Within this ideal redistribution, there is an 18.4% reduction in uptake of over-referred items, a modelled 0.8% growth in uptake of appropriately referred items, and a substantial growth in uptake of the targeted, under-referred items (activity by 84.9% and benefits claimed by 94.2%). The meso-level analysis demonstrates that the model has a defining normative bias in favour of increasing rurality and remoteness. This is consistent with the model&#8217;s aim of delivering supply-side incentives to service vulnerable social groups. The meso-level results also indicate that a staged implementation of the model is required. This is because the overwhelming majority of Australia&#8217;s population live within the more metropolitan and regional Divisions that require the greatest effort to glean benefit from the model. Initially, they may be the most difficult to engage. At the micro-level, the model is tested on estimated parameters matched to one-hundred and nineteen Divisions of General Practice. The result is that all the Divisions of General Practice within the existing network have sufficient critical mass to accumulate a material benefit from participation.  The study acknowledges that limitations in the model design may risk perverse incentives and unintended aberrations. For this reason, the model requires the protection of a regulatory framework to ensure its proper application in the field. Based on implementation experience, refinements may be required over time to reduce any unintended consequences. There are limitations to the study design which give cause for further investigation and testing in the field. The analyses rely on secondary data, which risks artefacts within the results. Further, this is a study of marginal costs and benefits, rather than a true cost-effectiveness analysis because the utilisation targets used are interim measures of process, and not definitive measures of change in health status. Finally, this study is also limited by its inability to test the model against the actual parameters from identified Divisions of General Practice. The study concludes that the model undergo further investigation and field testing in order to derive empirical results. It is also recommended that future studies test the generalisability of the model, with research into the redistribution modelling of general practice prescriptions and referrals to specialists for elective procedures. The consistent aim is to achieve marginal redistribution in the pursuit of an enhanced social welfare function.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/722</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating unity within an album for compositions defined as "jazz style"</field><field name="creator">Goyer, Edward</field><field name="description">Unity is an important factor when I compose music as it creates a sense of logic elements upon which the language of music can be communicated to the listeners. By the term &#8216;listener&#8217; I am referring to anyone, novice or educated, who listens to my music. Without the logic of unity, communication breaks down and the language of music consisting of both emotional and structural elements is no longer experienced by the listener. As part of my compositional approach, I have developed a set of rules that would allow unity to be created throughout the pieces to be recorded on the album. During the compositional process, it occurred to me that the largest unifying factor between all my compositions is that they were all written in &#8220;jazz fusion style&#8221;. If I was to consider style as a unifying feature, I needed to come up with a definition for what I believe qualifies my compositions as having been stylistically composed and performed as jazz, a major part of which, is the process of interplay and interaction between members of the ensemble. All the compositions on the album were recorded live with no multi-tracking or overdubbing. Using a live recording creates the maximum amount of interaction and interplay amongst the ensemble members necessary for my definition of jazz style in my compositions. It is my aim that the listener should be able to experience unifying factors between my compositions in some form while listening to the recording provided. They should also be able to recognize elements of interaction and interplay between ensemble members creating a sense of jazz style throughout my compositions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/769</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An agent-based framework for distributed intrusion detections</field><field name="creator">Ye, Dayong</field><field name="description">Network application has become a part of our everyday life. With the increasing of convenience and popularity of network, more and more malicious users utilize network to obtain their vicious intentions. In order to protect network users&#8217; information security and privacy, various intrusion detection systems were proposed and developed in the last decade. Intrusion detection as an emerging technology has made great achievements in theory and practice, whose aim is to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a system or resource. As a complex system, the development of an intrusion detection system includes many aspects, such as system architecture design, design and implementation of system components, system test in real cases, and so on. Though many intrusion detection systems have been presented, most of them mainly focus on one or two aspects of intrusion detection systems. This thesis aims at providing a rudimentary solution for an agent-based Peer-to-Peer distributed intrusion detection framework. The major contributions of this thesis include the following five aspects. 1. Introducing a novel Peer-to-Peer framework which involve different agents on different peers; 2. Designing functionalities of each agent in the framework by using JACK/UML approach; 3. Representing knowledge of each agent about intrusion and detection according to employing ontology; 4. Developing an efficient task allocation protocol which is used to coordinate different hosts in the system to collaboratively detect distributed attacks; 5. Implementing and testing the framework in a reasonable manner by utilizing an agent development environment, i.e. JACKTM. In summary, this framework integrates agent technology, Peer-to-Peer architecture, ontology technique and a task allocation protocol. Implementation and experiments v show the potential applicability of this framework to real cases. In addition, this framework could help in development of a good intrusion detection system in open and complex environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/797</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning as a game: exploring cultural differences between teachers and learners using a team learning system</field><field name="creator">Findlay, John Gilchrist</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis aims to investigate the first-time use of a tool for collective knowledge creation in order to explain how cultural differences between teachers and learners in the context of the historical development of tools contributes to student engagement and learning. To this end, a study was conducted at a secondary school in the United Kingdom with 92 teachers and students. The study was exploratory and is presented as a series of case studies, using a mixed method approach including discourse analysis and social network analysis.The study was interpreted via a complexity-activity framework based on cultural-historical activity theory (activity theory) as propounded by the original theorists (Luria, 1976; Vygotsky, 1978, 1986; Leont&#8217;ev, 1978) and more recent researchers (Engestrom, 1987; Miettinen, 1999; Tobach, 1999; Hedegaard, 2005). It is also informed by other theories of development or emergence including complexity theory and co-evolution (Cohen &amp; Stewart, 1994; Kauffman, 1995), innovation theory (Rogers, 1983; Foster, 1987), brain sciences (Schore, 2000; Freeman, 2000; Goldberg, 2001) flow theory (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) and theories of team development (Tuckman, 1965; Schein, 1988; Losada, 1999). Activity theory holds that humans develop culturally as well as genetically. Humans use language, symbols, gestures, signs and physical and psychological tools to transform themselves and society. Vygotsky showed that children develop in two main ways, via social interactions with adults and through collective play with their peers. Complexity theory offers a complementary explanation of the social, cultural and technological discontinuities and patterns of emergence in cognition and intersubjective relations that are evident in human activity.The literature review revealed a new pattern of childhood development, in which young people are now learning what it is to be human by interacting with smart sociocognitive tools and their peers. Many students are bored by their teachers&#8217; use of traditional monological pedagogical methods that maintain strict social control at the expense of learning. Students are frustrated by a lack of access to ICT and do not understand why teachers rarely use computers in the classroom. One in six students leave school unable to read, write and count, ill equipped for a world of work that demands high levels of literacy, numeracy, interpersonal skills and computer literacy for even the most basic jobs. At the same time, there are growing shortfalls for jobs that require complex negotiation and complex thinking skills to create, implement and maintain critical systems and infrastructure.The main conclusion of the study is that teachers and students are separated by two generations of tool use. This finding is consistent with Vygotsky and Luria&#8217;s original but discredited hypothesis of a periodic pattern to human learning and development at both a local and global scale. The teachers employed a centralized control model of tool use in their teaching that has its origins in the Industrial Age (1700-1940) whereas the students were more attuned to a social interactionist model that is Knowledge Age (1990- ) centric. The teachers were reluctant users of the tool in the classroom and quickly reverted to the lecture, closed questioning and individual activities as their preferred pedagogy. However, the teachers made frequent use of the tool for their own professional development and community meetings. The students were enthusiastic users of the tool and enjoyed the opportunity to use high level thinking processes, discuss topics and express their own opinions. Some senior students who used the tool to recall memorized information saw little difference between the traditional classroom and the team learning system activities. In the role of the facilitator, the teachers' and students' first performances were a chaotic mix of four speech types; the ideal and minimalist set of facilitator instructions required to coordinate a group, inner speech to guide the sequencing of the motor activity, previously learned speech routines applicable to other contexts and authority speech to maintain control. The facilitators&#8217; performances improved when the speech and motor activities became synchronised with the participant performances and the facilitator's fear of failure subsided in a shift from right brain to left-brain control. The senior students who were able to facilitate sessions competently after their initial training, were not encouraged to use their new skills in the classroom. All groups, with one exception, reported they were more engaged, enjoyed what they were doing and lost track of time when they participated in the team learning activity, which was consistent with the flow experience (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). The groups also reported they felt more aware of their surroundings and each other, which may be indicative of a change of state in the group, from a disorganized structure focused on the self to a more aligned structure focused on the group. Questions and contributed concepts acted as catalysts, which sparked more concepts. In some sessions, the students generated avalanches of concepts consistent with team formation. Closed questions generated few responses. Open-ended discussible and high-level questions stimulated the most ideas and the most complex ideas.The research findings have practical implications for school learning. The study showed that a tool such as the team learning system can scaffold rich questioning, promote high-level thinking and support leadership capacity in students, so that novice facilitators are able to successfully lead a group in complex learning activities after a few hours practice. A new model of learning characterised as &#8220;contagious learning&#8221; which involves playing &#8220;language games&#8221;(Wittgenstein, 1999) is proposed. Learners learn how to create and facilitate their own learning experiences and use the autocatalytic aspects of conceptual sets to accelerate the creation, spread and adoption of epidemics of ideas.New theory developed during the course of the study contributes to the field of social psychology by resolving several of the contradictions in activity theory (Davydov, 1999; Engestrom, 1999). The model focuses on the co-evolutionary relationship between the humans and tools, the automation of speech and motor routines and the ability of learners to deal with novelty and plan ahead. The new complexity-activity theory explains the differences between incremental and transformational change, clarifies the relationship between individual and collective activity, and provides a classification system for types of activity that links the worlds of the material and the ideal.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/800</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming a lawyer: the transformation of student identity through stories</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Cassandra Elizabeth</field><field name="description">To study law is to invite change. Not just change, but transformation. In the process of becoming lawyers, students interpret stories of law, transform meanings about law, and construct legal identity. Desperate to make sense of the world in which they will one day inhabit, first year law students draw on resources from two cultural realms: the legal and the social. In particular, they use popular stories as one resource to interpret what it means to be lawyer, and as a result students occupy a central place amid the intersection of law, society and fiction. This thesis is concerned with the interpretation and transformation of meaning about law and lawyering within the social and academic context of law school. Of particular concern are the stories that are interpreted and produced through the medium of television and within the context of law school. This thesis does not engage with the familiar debate over the way in which law is represented in popular culture, rather it offers a new scholarly perspective on how students use these images. Specifically, this thesis examines the significance of stories in students&#8217; construction of identity. It does so by empirically analysing the &#8216;talk&#8217; of focus groups. These groups were comprised of first year law students, and methodologically sought to address the use of stories within meaning-making processes and the construction of identity. Drawing from the analysis of these groups, the thesis shows that first year law is transformative moment in the students&#8217; identity construction; and that students use popular stories to interpret (and then retell) the ways in which they view a career in law. It further demonstrates that in their storied responses to popular culture students are grappling with notions of ethics and desperate to become ethically aware. The thesis concludes by arguing that student discussions reflect the imbrication of stories, ethics and identity, and for this reason, urges that stories be given explicit pedagogic value within the law school curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/838</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure communication over mobile ad-hoc network</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Zhenfei</field><field name="description">A Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is an ideal network that merely consists of mobiles devices without any pre-established infrastructure. However, the secure communication over a MANET is not straightforward. In this thesis, we present a solution for MANET secure communication. Generally speaking, it covers two main areas, namely key management and secure routing.In the key management area, we present an idea of adopting certificateless public key encryption (CL-PKE) schemes over mobile ad hoc network (MANET), which have not been explored before. In the current literature, there exists two main approaches, namely public key cryptography and identity-based (ID-based) cryptography. Unfortunately, they both have some inherent drawbacks. To avoid these obstacles, Al-Riyami and Paterson proposed certificateless cryptography systems. In this thesis, we adopt Al-Riyami&#8217;s advantage over MANET. To implement CL-PKE over MANET and to make it practical, we incorporate the idea of Shamir&#8217;s secret sharing scheme. The master secret keys are shared among some or all the MANET nodes. This makes the system self-organized once the network has been initiated. In order to provide more flexibility, we consider both a full distribution system and a partial distribution system.In the secure routing area, we present the idea of adopting a reputation system over the optimized link state routing (OLSR) protocol. In the literature, there exists two main routing approaches, namely proactive routing and reactive routing. Several secure reactive routing protocols have beenproposed. However, as far as proactive routing is concerned, few secure protocols are presented, yet they all possess different drawbacks that make them only practical on certain routing protocols. One of major problems is how to determine whether a node is worthy of trust or not. In other networks, for example, peer-to-peer sharing networks, reputation systems are designed to judge users. Unfortunately, they are designed specifically for peer-to-peer systems, while the adoption to MANET is not very straightforward. To this end, we present our Rep-OLSR, which selects routes wisely based on users&#8217; former performance by periodically collecting polling results from neighbour nodes.Finally, we demonstrate that our solution is robust against several types of attacks. We also test our solution with several simulations. The results of the simulations indicate that our solution efficiently secure the communication with little extra traffic compared with pure MANET routing protocols.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/839</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TrainNet: a novel transport infrastructure for non real-time data delivery</field><field name="creator">Zarafshan Araki, Mohammad</field><field name="description">To date, researchers have proposed many vehicular networks in which cars or buses act as a mechanical backhaul for transporting data. For example, a bus can be retrofitted with a computer and wireless card to automatically ferry data to/from rural villages without Internet connectivity. Alternatively, a person carrying a portable storage device can be used to link geographically disparate networks. These examples of challenged networks are characterized by frequent disruptions, long delays, and/or intermittent connectivity.This thesis proposes TrainNet, a vehicular network that uses trains to transport latency insensitive data. TrainNet augments a railway network by equipping stations and trains with mass storage devices; e.g., a rack of portable hard disks. TrainNet has two applications. First, it provides a low cost, very high bandwidth link that can be used to deliver non real-time data. In particular, cable TV operators can use TrainNet to meet the high bandwidth requirement associated with Video on Demand (VoD) services. Moreover, TrainNet is able to meet this requirement easily because its links are scalable, meaning their capacity can be increased inexpensively due to the continual fall of hard disk price. Secondly, TrainNet provides an alternative, economically viable, broadband solution to rural regions that are reachable via a railway network. Therefore, using TrainNet, rural communities will be able to gain access to bandwidth intensive digital contents such as music, video, television programs, and movies cheaply.A key problem in TrainNet is resource scheduling. This problem arises because stations compete for the fixed storage capacity on each train. To this end, this thesis is the first to propose three max-min scheduling algorithms, namely LMMF, WGMMF and GMMF, for use in challenged networks. These algorithms arbitrate the hard disk space among competing stations using local traffic information at each station, or those from other stations. To study these algorithms, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is first used to construct a model of TrainNet, before a simulator is constructed using the DESMO-J framework. The resulting TrainNet simulator is then used to investigate the behavior of said max-min algorithms in scenarios with realistic traffic patterns. Results show that while LMMF is the fairest algorithm, it results in data loss and has the longest mean delay, the lowest average throughput, and the lowest hard disk utilization. Furthermore, Jain&#8217;s fairness index shows WGMMF to be the least fair algorithm. However, it avoids data loss as is the case with GMMF, and achieves the best performance in terms of mean delay, averaged throughput, and hard disk utilization.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/842</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complete interoperability in healthcare : technical, semantic and process interoperability through ontology mapping and distributed enterprise integration techniques</field><field name="creator">Ducrou, Amanda Joanne</field><field name="description">Interoperability in healthcare is a requirement for effective communication between entities, to ensure timely access to up-to-date patient information and medical knowledge, and thus consistent patient care. This thesis focuses on the development of an interoperability solution for health by employing design science research methods to arrive at a final solution.First, background topics including Health Informatics standards and formats are covered, which leads to three major Health Informatics standards being used throughout the remainder of this work &#8211; HL7 for messaging, openEHR for patient records, and SNOMED CT as a standard terminology to facilitate clarity of information, and to discourage ambiguity between communicating entities.Ontology mapping methods between these standards designed to promote interoperability by using the standards in conjunction with each other are then presented, leading to a solution for semantic interoperability.A technical interoperability solution is required for sending these semantically interoperable messages, which leads to the development of a framework which uses a tuple-space paradigm to share messages.

However, there is little literature to inform the establishment phase of a new school. The literature that does exist suggests that new schools begin in a frenetic way. There is much excitement about possibilities and such schools appear to be places where all dreams are possible. Yet the literature has documented that they revert to the norm.  This thesis presents a case study of a secondary school during the first two years of its establishment. Specifically it focuses on the challenges and issues that foundation and second year staff faced when establishing a new school. During the first two years of the school&#8217;s establishment I was the foundation curriculum coordinator, hence my role is that of participant observer. The purpose of the study was to document the establishment phase of a new school from the perspective of an &#8216;insider&#8217; and hence relate the issues and challenges that face staff during this critical period. It was hoped that the results might contribute to the literature in the area. The second was to establish what structures are vital when establishing a new school that would result in sustainable practice.This study employed a method of case study design, and data collection included interviews with all foundation and second year staff, and analyses of observation journal and school archival documentation. Data analysis occurred in three distinct stages and was informed by Carney&#8217;s Analytical Ladder of Abstraction (1990). Stage 1 involved sourcing appropriate research on which initial themes could be identified. This search resulted in only a few documented case studies on new schools and several anecdotal descriptions. Stage 1 also involved an analysis of the observation journal to identify issues and themes at the case study school. This resulted in what is termed within this study as internal and external level forces that were in existence in the new school setting. As research in the area of new schools was modest, Stage 2 of the process involved sourcing appropriate literature on which to further the study. The assumption was made early that a new school would be designed based on an effective school. Hence, literature in the areas of school effectiveness, school improvement, school reform and sustainability were used. These areas of educational research promised knowledge about not only what constitutes an effective school, but also how a school can become and be sustained as an effective school. A synthesis of this literature resulted in a set of new school design characteristics. This literature also indicated that major educational change and reform innovations are conducted without a theory base of a process. Stage 3 involved an analysis of participant interviews and school documentation, and a comparison of these findings against the internal and external level forces and the new school design characteristics. During the time that the school has been in existence there has been only one Principal. The school&#8217;s original vision embraced principles of a middle school philosophy. The initial structures in terms of pastoral care and curriculum were to be based on these philosophies. After ten years some practices were sustained at the school. Primarily these structures were to do with pastoral care. The curriculum structures have not been sustained but during a recent follow-up interview with the Principal there was an indication that the initial philosophies were being revisited and attempts made to adopt appropriate middle school practices again. The findings of this study revealed challenges and issues in regards to eight critical structures, they were: vision and philosophy; effective decision-making and communication; basic managerial functioning; the wider community; appropriate professional development; clear role definitions; support of staff; and appropriate future planning. Also, the comparison of these eight structures against the internal and external level forces and the new school design characteristics resulted in an integrated set of new school design characteristics. By utilising the most recent literature in the area of comprehensive school reform, principles of design were also developed. The principles provide a framework by which the design principles would be enacted. The design principles refer to: the school as a human system, the clear articulation and acceptance of a vision; a design for the school; rules that govern practice that are specific, comprehensive, coherent and consistent; practices that are implicit and embedded; appropriate, consistent and emergent feedback; support of staff; and structures that disperse control and authority.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/140</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel approaches to the analysis of pathogenic bacterial populations in neonatal and weaner porcine colibacillosis</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Toni</field><field name="description">Exploiting the concept that pathogenic and commensal Escherichia coli strains can be distinguished on the basis of housekeeping enzymes by MLEE, a panel of 58 virulence genes was used to analyse the phylogenetic relationship between commensal E. coli and pathogenic E. coli from clinical cases of porcine neonatal and post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD). Of the 58 virulence genes examined, 17 (STb, iha, hlyA, STa, aidA, F18, east1, LT, fimH, iroNE.coli, aah, F4, traT, F41, F5, saa and stx2) were able to differentiate between the groups of isolates based on Chi-squared analysis. Application of two other statistical methods; an agglomerative hierarchical algorithm and principle coordinate analysis (PCO) to the isolates resulted in a relational depiction consisting of a branching tree dendrogram and point-clustering respectively. In both situations, member clones designated as commensals and pathogens were separated from each other. However, commensal and neonatal diarrhoea (ND) isolates tended to be more similar to each other and together, more different from post-weaning diarrhoea clones.The observation that individual post-weaning and commensal clones could be segregated suggested that a similar approach based on an analysis of many clones from healthy and scouring weaners may be able to distinguish pigs on their health status. This was successfully tested by analysis of virulence gene profiles of representative subset populations of E. coli recovered from individual animal samples using a replicating machine to entrap bacteria on hydrophobic grid membrane filters (HGMF). This method referred to as population based microbial analysis (PoMA) provided a reliable tool to distinguish between clinical, subclinical and healthy pigs. PoMA was used to determine the population virulence gene profile, generating a host profile for each individual pig. Using the 58 virulence genes analysed, 13 (LT, aah, aidA, cvaC, STb, STa, bmaE, papC, iroNE.coli, papG allele I&#8217;, ehxA, cdt &amp; F18) could be used to distinguish between the two groups of piglets (based on Chi-squared analysis). Further statistical analysis to generate a cluster dendrogram, and principle coordinate (PCO) analysis revealed segregation of isolates based on health status (healthy and scouring separated into different groupings). When extended to a group of subclinical animals, the method also successfully clustered these in between the healthy and scouring weaners by principle coordinate analysis PoMA has the hallmarks of a statistically reliable diagnostic tool for the analysis of clinical samples from individual animals, pools of animals and even, pools of samples from different farms for comparative analysis.When applied to newborn piglets with neonatal diarrhoea, PoMA replication on CHROMAgar Orientation medium successfully identified the presence of an unreported population of enterococci that dominated on culture media intended to recover primarily E. coli. Selection of single clones followed by enumeration revealed elevated numbers of enterococci in scouring neonates compared to healthy piglets with E. faecium present at a similar ratio to E. faecalis whilst none of the latter was present in the enterococci isolated from healthy piglets. Since antibiotic resistance of enterococci has recently gained eminence as a threat to human health and because microbial contamination from pig meat can also enter the human food chain, an analysis of porcine enterococci isolates was carried out to compare their virulence genes and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles to clinical human enterococci isolates. The porcine strains had similar virulence genes to human isolates but fortuitously, none of the isolates examined so far in this thesis contained the vanA or vanB genes for vancomycin resistance. A role for enterococci in neonatal diarrhoea remains to be elucidated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/170</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of hot rolling events that lead to ridge-buckle defect in steel strips</field><field name="creator">Melfo, Wanda Maria Carolina</field><field name="description">Thinly cold-rolled steel sheet, following hot-rolling, sporadically present a defect known in industry as ridge-buckle. The defect is only detected in the last stage of production of thin rolled strips, after they have been hot rolled, cold rolled, annealed and tempered. Ridge-buckle consists of sinusoidal waveforms located in one or two bands near the central region of the strip width and in most cases, affecting the full length of the strip. Coils with such a defect have to be discarded or degraded. The aim of this manuscript is to present our contribution towards an elucidation of the origins of ridge-buckle defect by experimental and theoretical approaches combined with analysis of plant data.We explored two of the main factors that in the past, has been regarded as possible origins of ridge-buckle defect: a) the occurrence of microstructural variations along the width of the hot rolled strip, which could lead to different extents of deformation during cold rolling and subsequent operations; and b) the presence of a protuberance (also called ridge) on the hot rolled strip, which will directly affect the shape of the cold rolled strip.The possibility that variations in grain size or crystallographic texture along the width of the strip could contribute to the formation of ridge-buckle defect was explored by studying samples extracted from strips hot-rolled in the industrial process. We determined experimentally and compared quantitatively, the ferrite grain sizes and the crystallographic orientations of grains along the width of the strip. In the strips studied, no evidence was found of any statistically significant variations in these two microstructural variables.Empirical models of recrystallization were used in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the quantitative impact of minor temperature variations (of the order experienced in practice) on the strip strength and hence, its mechanical behaviour within the rolling process. This exploratory exercise confirmed that the strip strength during hot rolling varies very little as a result of relatively small variations in temperature along the width of the strip. Furthermore, the ferrite grain size developed following hot-rolling and cooling on the run-out table, also varies very little due to the temperature variations measured. Therefore, the strength of the hot rolled strip along its width is not affected to the extent that can have a significant influence on the deformation in the subsequent rolling processes. These calculations led us to conclude that ridge in the hot rolled strip is not related to uneven deformation during rolling due to strength variations and hence, ridge buckle defect cannot be attributed to strength differences along the width of the hot-rolled strip.In industrial practice, the occurrence of ridge-buckle in subsequent cold rolling operations has been linked to the presence of ridges in the hot rolled strip. Moreover, a modelling study conducted in parallel with this investigation confirmed this link. Having established that variations in microstructure, texture or strength along the hot-rolled strip width are unlikely causes of the occurrence of ridgebuckle defect we attempted to link ridge occurrence in hot rolled strips and to uneven roll-wear in the finishing mill. By collecting data of 40 consecutive schedules, we were able to determine that ridge formation in hot rolled strips is a common occurrence. Moreover, uneven roll-wear was frequently observed, at least in the period and in the schedules over which our data were collected. A significant finding was the establishment of a strong link between ridge occurrence on the hotrolled strips and uneven roll wear occurring close to the centre of the work-rolls in the finishing-mill.The evidence of uneven wear on the work-rolls in the hot strip mill led our study to an assessment of the possible causes of uneven roll-wear. A thorough review of the available literature in conjunction with the evidence we found of excessive ridge formation in steels containing silicon, led to the hypothesis that the integrity of the tertiary strip scale in the roll bite could be a major contributing factor to uneven roll-wear.We developed a method to study in-situ the formation of oxides on the hot steel substrate, by adapting a High Temperature Microscope with means to introduce air instantaneously onto the surface of the sample. This technique enabled us to study oxidation of the steel surface under conditions closely simulating the oxygen potential pertaining to the rolling temperatures in industrial finishing rolling practice (excluding the complicating effects of water cooling). The in-situ experimentation was complemented with a thorough characterisation of the oxides remaining on the samples after cooling by using relevant metallographic techniques.The experiments were conducted on two types of steel, low carbon steel and silicon containing steel. The results show distinctive differences in the oxidation behaviour of the two types of steel. The low carbon steel form a typical three-layered structure of iron oxides although with very little (almost undetectable) hematite formation. On the other hand, the silicon steels, which apart from silicon also contain aluminium and manganese in small amounts, formed a thick interface layer of complex oxides and intermetallics between the substrate and a layer of magnetite followed by a hematite layer at the gas/oxide interface. It was evident that in silicon steels, the formation of the interface layer interfered with the diffusion of iron species as the final oxide layer was significantly thinner than the oxide layer that formed on low-carbon steel.Another significant finding in the case of low carbon steel was the tendency of the oxide to detach or &#8220;spall&#8221; from the surface during oxide growth. We were able to observe the detachment of the oxide in-situ with precise account of the time and temperature of occurrence. The relevance of this finding is that if sufficient time elapsed between spallation of the scale and the strip entering the roll-bite, brittle scale would form (due to isolation of the oxide layer from the iron source). The scale then will fracture under the loads applied in the roll-bite, affecting the heat transfer to the rolls and hence, its thermal fatigue resistance. Furthermore, we were able to observe and determine the time to nucleation of new oxides that form on top of already existing oxides on low carbon steel substrate. The time required to nucleate the new oxide is related to the austenite grain size of the steel substrate. Further studies are proposed to elucidate the exact nature of this interesting sequence of events.Finally, early oxidation events were linked to uneven roll-wear due to fracture of the scale in the roll-bite, an increase in the heat transfer rate to the work-roll surface and friction in the roll-bite. An assessment of the possible causes that may affect the integrity of the tertiary scale led us to conclude that whenever uneven changes occur in the cooling patterns of the strip or roll, in descaling efficiency or in the lubrication systems, uneven roll-wear could result.Although a definitive solution to the 40-year old problem of ridge-buckle defect is still to be found, we have made advances in narrowing the possible origins of the defect to specific causes or events. Ridge-buckle is originated mainly by the presence of ridge in the hot-rolled strip; in turn, ridge occurrence is related to uneven wear of the work-rolls in the finishing-mill. Uneven wear is most likely caused by failure of the tertiary scale, due most probably to uneven cooling and/or lubrication patterns during the hot rolling process. In addition to these findings, a novel method of studying scale formation during the early stages of the interaction between oxygen and the steel substrate was developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/702</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery goals: goal quality, goal content and the impact of goal attainment on outcome for consumers with enduring mental illness</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Samantha</field><field name="description">Personal goals are an important foundation of recovery from enduring mental illness (EMI), providing a sense of meaning, identity and hope. Recovery goals, within a case-management setting, are developed in collaboration between the person in recovery from EMI and the mental health worker. Goals are a fundamental component of most rehabilitation programs and models of recovery emphasise the importance of the goal striving process, yet minimal research has examined goal setting and striving within the mental health case-management context. This thesis aimed to progress recovery research related to goal striving. Four studies are presented that examine aspects of recovery goal setting for consumers with EMI.Study 1 and 2 examined aspects of goal setting quality. Study 1 investigated the quality of goal setting within Australian mental health services. Mental health consumer files (N = 122) were reviewed and goal records were assessed for quality. Seventy four percent of files contained a goal record and on average goal records included 50% of goal setting principles likely to enhance goal progress. Goal setting quality was examined after mental health workers were trained in the Collaborative Recovery Model (CRM), which includes goal setting protocols drawn from previous evidence from goal research. Mental health consumers&#8217; goal records (N = 78) both prior to and subsequent to the Collaborative Recovery Training Program (CRTP) were also reviewed. CRTP lead to an improvement in both the frequency and quality of goal setting and the use of a structured goal setting intervention also seemed to promote further goal quality.To examine the relationship between goal quality and improvements in working alliance and treatment outcome, standardised residual gain scores for the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI-s) and mental health outcome measures were calculated and correlated with goal quality for 110 mental health consumers. Goal quality was also associated with the goal and task subscales of the consumer rated WAI-s, and there was a modest relationship between goal quality and improvements in symptom distress.Study 2 also examined goal quality by surveying mental health workers (N = 83) on the clinical utility of the Collaborative Goal Technology (CGT) - a structured goal setting protocol. Workers reported they were more likely to use skills to develop meaningful and manageable goals when compared to the skills required to review goal progress. Technical skills of the CGT (calculating the Collaborative Goal Index and different levels of goal attainment) were employed least. Insufficient time was often reported as impeding correct use of the CGT and consumer factors (i.e., not being interested, too unstable) was the most frequently reported reason for mental health workers not attempting the CGT.Study 3 examined the content of case-management goals set within recovery and investigated whether the content of goals differed depending on the stage of psychological recovery. One hundred and forty four mental health consumers&#8217; CGT&#8217;s were reviewed. Physical health goals were reported significantly more frequently than any other types of goal and were rated as most important by 23% of consumers. Goals focused on employment and developing and maintaining relationships were often identified as most important, suggesting these types of goals are often a source of meaning and purpose for consumers within recovery. Significantly more health goals were set within the first stage of psychological recovery and health goals were also associated with poorer scores on the Recovery Assessment Scale - short. This suggests that in the early phases of recovery a focus on basic health needs is a priority and may signify the lack of longer term more meaningful goals at this time. Themes in the data suggest that people further along in their recovery set a greater range of goals. Relationship goals were typically set within the middle stages of recovery followed by employment goals toward the later stages of recovery. There was also significantly more approach goals set within the last two stages of recovery indicating that within these final stages, goals are more likely to be focused on moving towards desirable outcomes rather than avoiding negative outcomes.Study 4 explored the relationship between case-management goal attainment and improvements in mental health outcome (N = 71). Path modelling indicated that when symptoms are perceived as less distressing consumers are better able to make progress towards their case-management goals, which in turn promotes aspects of recovery such as; hope, self-confidence, sense of purpose and positive identity. This highlights the importance of a recovery framework of casemanagement, placing a focus on both alleviation of symptoms and promoting striving towards personally meaningful goals in order to promote recovery from EMI.The present research provides insight into the quality and content of goals set within recovery from mental illness for consumers with EMI and also provides support that goal attainment is associated with enhanced psychological recovery. Longitudinal research is required to assess the direction of the relationships found between treatment outcome and goal quality and goal attainment and, goal content and psychological recovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/808</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scientists in laboratories: a comparative study on the organisation of science and goal orientations of scientists in CSIRO (Australia) and CSIR (India) institutions</field><field name="creator">Krishna, V. V.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a comparative sociological investigation of the laboratory life-world of scientists. In particular, the thesis deals with the organisation of science and the ways in which the orientations of scientists and their research activity are structured in laboratories across national and cultural contexts.Theoretically, the thesis employs a range of theoretical concepts drawn from general sociology, the sociology of knowledge, phenomenology, political sociology of science, symbolic interaction theory and the social history of science. The most influential theoretical stream that formed the basis for the action and meaning approach used in the analysis of science, is the 'interpretive' perspective drawn most centrally from the works of Schutz, Weber and Mannheim.The theoretical framework developed in the first part of the thesis forms a coherent basis for the empirical investigation presented in the second part - through the methodology which is specifically developed to carry the 'interpretive' perspective of the theory into methodological assumptions and practice. The theoretical framework provides a basis for analysis of the action and meaning context of scientists within, and across two laboratory 'structures', as well as for analysis of interaction of the scientists with wider groups and agencies in the trans-laboratory and socio-historical contexts. The CFTRI/CSIR (in a non-Western culture context) and die FRL/CSIRO (in a Western culture context) formed the basis for empirical exploration through sixteen propositions drawn from the theory and the history of the laboratory case studies.The field research conducted in this thesis involved the generation of a 'method of multiple feedback'. This method was generated as epistemological frame that aligned with the interpretationist frame of theory in the thesis. Following Mannheim, this method sought not only to observe - at "objective" level &#8211; from without the subjective experience of scientists, but to draw the scientist-actor's own construction of expressive, evidential and objective meaning into the analysis of science in its institutional framework. This method involved the generation of data at five different levels of generality, employing feedback between these levels to form an overall interpretive synthesis of the relation between history, culture, politics, the scientific profession and the experience of scientist-actors.The overall picture presented in this thesis reflects that scientific research and the action of scientists in laboratories are structured through a dynamic social process within particular social, political, cultural and historic contexts relative to the laboratory context.On the basis of the theory and empirical research contained in the two case studies, the thesis demonstrates that scientists in CFTRI/CSIR and FRL/CSIRO are governed by two distinct traditions in research 'cultures' specific to the laboratory's national and cultural context. Towards the evolution of specific research 'cultures', the two laboratory organisations were found to be in constant negotiation with the socio-economic and political environment surrounding the institutions. Whilst the scientific research in CFTRI was found to be influenced by the utilitarian research 'culture' of CSIR, the research in FRL was observed to be highly influenced by the CSIRO 'culture' of excellence in scientific research. Correspondingly, the empirical research on the goal orientations of scientists in the two laboratory case studies, demonstrates that the meaning of research action is a product of the influences routed through the research 'cultures' extant in the respective laboratory's historic context.The case studies contained in this thesis directly challenge the controversial assertion that 'science is universal and culture free'.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1728</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurements and modelling of emissions from biomass burning in Australia</field><field name="creator">Paton-Walsh, Clare</field><field name="description">This thesis describes work aimed at improving our knowledge of emissions to the atmosphere from Australian vegetation fires. The thesis contains three main parts. First there is a study to characterise the emissions from forest fires in southeast Australia. This uses ground-based Fourier transform infrared solar absorption spectroscopy, coupled with ultra-violet/visible spectroscopy, to explore the properties of smoke plumes from Australian forest fires that passed over the observation site at Wollongong, in New South Wales, Australia (34.4&#176;S, 150.9&#176;E). The particulate loading in the smoke plumes is characterised by the aerosol optical depth, measured at visible wavelengths. Vertically integrated amounts of a several emitted trace gases are also determined, (limited to those detectable by solar absorption spectroscopy in the infrared). Enhanced trace gas amounts of carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ammonia, acetylene, ethylene, ethane, formic acid and methanol were measured in the smoke plumes and quantified via the use of emission ratios. The emission ratios determined in this study indicate that emissions from fires in southeastern Australian forests (which are predominantly eucalypts) are broadly similar to those from other geographical regions except for comparatively low emissions of ethane. The second part of this thesis describes a new method of making estimates of gaseous emissions from fires. Strong correlations between trace gases and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in smoke plumes are used in conjunction with satellite-based measurements of AOD to estimate the total amounts of carbon monoxide and other gases emitted from the Canberra fires of 2003. There are significant difficulties with the new method, in particular the interruption of the satellite record due to clouds or technical problems with the satellite. Nevertheless the estimated emissions of carbon monoxide from the Canberra fires (4.9 &#8211; 9.6 Tg), is in agreement with an estimate made by existing techniques. The addition of another tool for making estimates of gaseous emissions from biomass burning is useful for corroborating existing techniques, especially since the sources ofuncertainties inherent in the different techniques are largely independent of one another. The third part of the thesis is a study to characterise the emissions from savanna fires in the tropical north of Australia. Again ground-based Fourier transform infrared solar absorption spectroscopy is used with automated measurements in the near infrared from a site in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia, (12.4&#176;S, 130.9&#176;E). Alternatively measurements in the mid infrared can be made by overriding the automated system, and this has been done when there is evidence of significant smoke plumes in the area. Total column amounts of carbon monoxide from Darwin from 2005-2008 show a very clear annual cycle, with evidence of transported pollution from Indonesian fires in 2006. The time series agrees within the expected uncertainties with measurements of carbon monoxide derived from the MOPITT satellite instrument, giving greater confidence to MOPITT retrievals in the tropics. Mid infrared spectra have been recorded through smoke plumes over Darwin on 20 separate days, yielding column amounts of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, acetylene, ethane and hydrogen cyanide and emission ratios with respect to carbon monoxide for the four latter gases from tropical north Australian savanna fires. Emission ratios for acetylene and ethane from this work are in broad agreement with other literature values, whilst emission ratios for formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide are significantly higher than the only previous field measurements from Australian savannas (but in agreement with laboratory studies) suggesting storage losses in the earlier study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3022</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theological critique of the HIPC debt initiative: redefining the sovereign debtor and creditor relationship</field><field name="creator">Moerman, Lee C</field><field name="description">This thesis uses a theological perspective to extend the literature on accounting and accountability as applied to a secular context and provides insights into the role of supranational institutions and poor, indebted countries. In particular, this thesis focuses on the joint International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) framework for debt relief specifically designed for a group of countries with unpayable external debt and extreme poverty, referred to as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative. Despite continued intervention, the HIPC Debt Initiative has failed to deliver debt relief and achieve poverty alleviation. This thesis provides analyses of this failure from a theological perspective and provides new insights and possibilities.  A theological perspective provides an alternate critique of the assumptions of the HIPC Debt Initiative. This thesis uses Jubilee Law as theory, as it explicitly focuses on the debtor/creditor relationship. In order to analyse the HIPC Debt Initiative, this thesis uses discourse analysis informed by Mannheim&#8217;s sociology of knowledge. This methodology enables an analysis of artefacts, in particular institutional discourse, such as that produced by supranational organisations (IMF and WB). This discourse is explored at three levels of meaning and provides distinct insights to understand the HIPC Debt Initiative and the resultant failure. The Jubilee Law has explicit themes of accountability, stewardship, intragenerational equity, intergenerational equity and notably still uses an economic rationale. These critical themes are used to offer insights into the HIPC Debt Initiative by redefining the debtor and creditor relationship. The redefinition places a new emphasis on the creditor&#8217;s responsibility for debt relief and poverty alleviation. This new perspective shifts the debtor and creditor relationship from one of dependence on the creditor to one of interdependence between the debtor and creditor. This shift does not abrogate the debtor&#8217;s responsibility but this concomitant shift of power offers emancipatory opportunities for poor, indebted countries hitherto not envisaged. The insight from this thesis offers an alternate set of propositions for the framework which offer emancipatory potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3030</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The attitudes of students towards people with disabilities in integrated environments in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Tan, Guat Lan Abi</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the attitudes of regular students in Singapore towards peers with physical and sensory disabilities who were integrated into the mainstream classroom. The concept of integration impacting on the attitudinal development in this study is based on the socio-cultural perspectives of child development (Bronfenbrenner, 1989; Vygotsky, 1993) and the discourse of contact experience (Allport, 1954; Zajonc, 2001). Child development theorists advocate that children&#8217;s learning requires support structures such as informed adults to guide learning and that development is intricately intertwined with the socio-cultural contexts. Alternatively, contact theory suggests that the contact experience has an inherent positive impact on attitudes and behaviour. The 397 participants were grade 4 and grade 5 students from integrated and regular classes in integrated and regular schools in Singapore. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies were used to assess the attitudes of regular students in both integrated and regular classes towards people with disabilities. The participants completed a researcher-designed questionnaire, took part in focus group interviews and were observed in class. The integrated class teachers were also interviewed.This study supported the conclusion that an integrated learning environment had a significant impact on regular students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities. In the quantitative study, regular students in integrated classrooms were found to have negative attitudes towards peers who had a disability. On the other hand, students in regular classes were found to be generally more able to appreciate the strengths of people with disabilities. The findings challenged the &#8216;contact model&#8217; that states that contacts with people with disabilities influence children&#8217;s attitudes in a positive way. The qualitative study highlighted the importance of the socio-cultural context and the quality of the contact experience in students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities. It was found that contact which was supported by specific school and classroom programs at school and class level was associated with positive attitudes of regular students towards peers with disabilities. Such support programs promoted inclusive ideals, positive differentiation and provided opportunities for meaningful experiences. The study affirmed the significant role of the teacher in facilitating the positive contact experience. The integrated class with the teacher, who modelled positive communication that promoted acceptance and positive perception, was found to have more positive attitudes. The teachers in the integrated classes, where students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities were found to be negative, were lacking in knowledge of special education and needed guidelines to intervene with their special needs students. This suggests that appropriately informed teaching practice that encourages social interaction among students could help reduce misunderstanding and stereotyping of people with disabilities. The social-cultural contexts at a broader level were also examined in this research.  It was found that societal aspirations for academic excellence had an impact on students. The students in this study displayed signs of being anxious over their academic performance being affected by the presence of peers with disabilities. Regular students perceived integration as acceptable only if it was not at the expense of their academic performance.The findings of this study have significant implications for the future of integration in Singaporean schools and understanding the impact of integration on regular students. The study affirmed that positive integrated learning experiences articulated through supportive school cultures, effective classroom practice and enlightened teachers could affect regular students&#8217; attitudes towards people with disabilities in a positive way. However, an achievement-focused culture can impact on students&#8217; acceptance of people with disabilities. Achievement pressure experienced by regular students is entwined with societal values and this can challenge the potential outcomes of integration programs in the Singaporean context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3037</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In service of empire : domestic service and colonial mastery in Singapore and Darwin, 1890s-1930s</field><field name="creator">Lowrie, Claire</field><field name="description">The research on colonial domestic service has offered compelling insights into the politics of intimacy. The colonial home is recognised as a highly charged political site crucial to colonial projects. The domestic service relationship has been conceptualised as a symbol and a site of colonial power. The literature on colonial domestic service is, however, limited by three key factors. The notion that only European homes constitute &#8216;colonial&#8217; homes, the focus on the white mistress as the key domestic actor regardless of historical period and the lack of analysis of the master-male servant relationship has ensured an incomplete understanding of the dynamics of colonial power. This thesis addresses these limitations by undertaking a comparative and transcolonial history of domestic service and colonialism in Darwin and Singapore from the 1890s to the 1930s. The thesis considers the politics of colonial intimacy beyond European homes, taking masculinity into consideration, and, with an understanding of how colonial home-life was subject to change. I analyse male and female domestic servants from a variety of ethnic groups &#8211; including Chinese, Malay and Australian Aboriginals &#8211; working in Chinese and European homes. I argue that in Darwin and Singapore a &#8216;transcolonial culture of domestic service&#8217; developed. This term describes the commonalities in the structure of the domestic workforce in these two sites, the shared discourses surrounding servitude and mastery which circulated and the common domestic dilemmas which employers of servants lamented. The notion of a transcolonial culture of domestic service is not just a description of commonalities. It offers a framework of analysis which draws attention to how factors within specific colonial encounters, influences between colonial sites and forces at a global level impacted on the colonial home and the domestic service relationship.The combination of a comparative approach and the notion of a transcolonial culture of domestic service raises new questions and points of discussion which can be used to think outside the confines of the &#8216;colonial home&#8217; as it has been conceptualised. It points to the importance of previously untheorised domestic power relations, including the power of white men over non-white men in the home, the power of servants to determine the course of household change and the colonial significance of domestic power in non-European homes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3041</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spatial variation of environmental factors on the Illawarra escarpment and their influence on vegetation patterns</field><field name="creator">Ashcroft, Michael B</field><field name="description">Mapping and explaining the distribution of vegetation helps land managers to make systematic conservation planning decisions. This is typically achieved using models that correlate the distribution of species with environmental factors, and can predict the vegetation at unsurveyed locations. These Species Distribution Models (SDMs) have numerous unresolved issues, but serve as a useful first-pass approximation for planning purposes.This thesis investigates some of the uncertainties of SDMs, including the impact of data accuracy, the incorporation of spatial processes, the evaluation of alternative models, and the benefits and challenges of producing models at the landscape scale. The research was conducted on the Illawarra Escarpment, 80 km south of Sydney, Australia (34.4 oS, 150.9 oE). The escarpment contains a north-south trend in eucalypts (Eucalyptus spp.) that cannot be explained in terms of elevation or geology. It also exhibits a patchy distribution of rainforest communities, some unique to the Illawarra. It is not known which environmental factors determine the distribution of either the eucalypts or rainforest species, or how they may respond to a changing climate.Species distributions are sensitive to the accuracy of data used, and yet many models only use elevation as a surrogate for temperature, or use simple elevation sensitive interpolations from weather stations. I collected hourly temperature data from 40 sites on the Illawarra Escarpment, and investigated whether elevation was an adequate surrogate for temperatures in this landscape. I then investigated whether temperature surfaces could be improved by considering other topographic and geographic factors, including exposure to wind, distance to coast, radiation, and the average conditions in the surrounding neighbourhood. Elevation was well correlated with moderate seasonal temperatures (e.g. summer minima and winter maxima), but was poorly correlated with the extreme temperatures (summer maxima, winter minima) that are physiologically limiting for many species. Using neighbourhood influences, exposure to wind and distance to coast improved the accuracy of temperature surfaces, and increased the explanatory performance of vegetation models. I concluded that elevation was not always an adequate surrogate for temperature. Temperatures are also affected by other topographic and geographic factors, and these should be considered when developing models for systematic conservation planning activities.Species distribution models are typically based solely on niche factors. Where spatial processes are included, it is typically by employing autologistic regression, or other techniques that use survey data as a predictor. This precludes the models being used to make predictions in times or places where survey data is unavailable, and reduces ecological explanation because it is an interpolation technique. I used neighbourhood (contextual) indices based on environmental factors as an alternative method to overcome these problems. I demonstrate that contextual indices improve SDMs over purely niche-based models, and are capable of predicting unknown populations in unsurveyed areas. I conclude that contextual indices have numerous advantages over autologistic regression, and can capture a continuum between niche and dispersal limited species.Models that predict how species will respond to climate change either use coarse-scale climate surfaces, or idealised predictions of uniform warming. These methods may dramatically over-estimate extinction risk because they neglect fine-scale variations in warming, and refugia where species can persist despite unfavourable regional conditions. I created fine-scale estimates of warming by combining 35 years of Bureau of Meteorology observations with one year of intensive fine-scale temperature monitoring. I found that warming was greatest at inland locations, at lower elevations, away from streams, and at sites exposed to hot, dry northwesterly winds. As species are biased in the geographic and topographic positions they occupied, some species have experienced more warming than others and are at greater threat from climate change. I concluded that it was important to continue developing methods to downscale coarse-grained climate surfaces, and suggest that the accuracy of this process could be improved by using a range of topographic factors.There are many methods for selecting predictors in SDMs, and the competing models often make highly variable predictions. I addressed this uncertainty by comparing the performance of models with and without a given environmental factor. I found that there was relatively strong support for the geology and winter minimum temperature predictors, as well as predictors based on contextual indices, as there was a significant drop in model performance when these predictors were excluded. In contrast, there was less support for summer maximum temperature, as other temperature predictors could combine to produce similar model performance. Model performance varied more between models for different species than between different predictor combinations for the same species. I concluded that it was inappropriate to assess models based on subjective benchmarks, such as an AUC of more than 0.7. A comparison between competing models for the same species gives a better indication of the validity of the model building procedure.The results of this research provide important insights into the benefits and challenges of creating SDMs at the landscape scale (extent of 10&#8211;200 km). It is a major challenge to obtain spatially and thematically accurate environmental predictors and biotic data at this scale, and studies should include the collection of data to ensure models are adequate. Landscapes will not have as much environmental variation as coarse-scale models, and this will limit the ability to transfer the models to new study areas. However, there are a number of benefits that justify these studies. Producing accurate temperature surfaces at the landscape scale will result in less pseudoreplication and less predictor colinearity. This will improve the robustness of models. Landscape scale studies also allow modellers to capture fine-scale refugia, and this will improve the accuracy of climate change predictions. Finally, many ecological processes operate at a scale that is too fine to be detected with coarse-scale models. Landscape scale models may be the only alternative to detect these processes. There is no optimal scale for SDMs, however, and a future challenge is to better integrate coarse and fine-scale models to make more ecologically robust predictions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3042</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass mobilisation in Indonesian politics, 1960-2001: towards a class analysis</field><field name="creator">Lane, Maxwell Ronald</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an analysis of the course of political developments between 1960 and 2001 arguing that the determining factor at key conjunctures was class struggle, as manifested in the mass mobilisation of Indonesia&#8217;s popular classes: the proletariat, semi-proletariat and pauperized petty bourgeoisie, (the latter including the peasants). The thesis deploys classical Marxist concepts, in their connections to some of Indonesia&#8217;s political thinkers, especially Soekarno. It critiques some of the major in-depth (book length) struggles on political developments during this period as negating or downplaying the class factor, and in particular class struggle and mass mobilisation, in their studies.The thesis argues that it has been the nature of two crisis caused by the escalation of mass mobilisation of the popular classes against a ruling class and its political elite, and the nature of the resolution of these two crisis, that best explains what happens at two key conjunctures in modern Indonesian history, 1965 and 1998. In 1965 the sharpening polarization between two visions of Indonesia was resolved with mass repression and the emergence of the New Order regime. The thesis examines how the political activity one side of this polarization was increasingly manifested in mass mobilisation and how the new regime was structured to permanently end all mass mobilisation activity. The thesis examines the nature of the crisis, namely an impending threat of the forces of the mass mobilisation winning power.The thesis later examines the process whereby mass mobilisation politics in the period 1989-1998,  re-asserted itself, through the agency of a small initiating political group, the Peoples&#8217; Democratic Party, and through the increasing involvement of more and more elements from the popular classes. A part of the examination presents the analysis that the content of class struggle for this period, in the aftermath of the radical suppression of mass mobilisation, was the struggle of the popular classes to reassert a right to mobilize. The thesis then examines the nature of crisis caused by the escalating mass mobilisation of this period, especially as it climaxes between 1996 and 1998.Through an examination of the reasons for the inability of the political movement based on mass mobilisation to win power and its inability to sustain further escalation between 1998 and 2001, the thesis attempts to locate political weaknesses of the mass mobilisation politics that emerged in the 1990s, identifying in particular its weak ideological activity and dependence on alliance with dissident elements from within the ruling class and its elite.The conclusion sums up these arguments as well as looks at possible future trends and the research agendas that would be needed to pursue this kind of approach in regard to future developments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3045</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A modelling of microstructure evolution and crack opening in FCC materials under tension</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Nam Nhat</field><field name="description">The field of fracture mechanics can generally be divided into two groups: (i) the study of material behaviour prior to crack and (ii) the developing of crack opening criteria. Even though various studies have been done in both subjects there are still gaps that need to be bridged. This thesis aims at combining both groups of the modelling of dynamic fracture in crystalline materials at a reasonable cost of computational time. A model of crystal plasticity finite element method has been formulated to account for the effects of lattice structure in the crystalline materials. The model has been applied to simulate tensile deformation around a notch tip in both single crystals and polycrystalline aggregates. By comparing with observations from various experiments, the model has been proved to be able to accurately capture the material&#8217;s behaviours around a notch tip undergoing tensile load. Particularly, this model is among the very few, if not the first, that accurately predicts various experimental observations of two notch tip orientations (010)[101] and (010)[100] that are widely found in the literature. This study has also developed a crack opening criterion that is dependent upon the evolution of the lattice structure. The core of this new criterion is an atomic interaction model that estimates energies of the interface of an fcc bicrystal. Results of grain boundary energy of &lt;100&gt; and &lt;110&gt; symmetrical tilt boundaries of an aluminum bicrystal obtained from the atomic interaction model agree very well with those from molecular dynamics simulations. The newly developed criterion has been applied to the modelling of crack opening and crack growth in a region around the notch tip in single crystals. Elements in the finite element mesh satisfying the criterion are removed from the mesh by using the element removal technique in Abaqus/Standard. Missing elements effectively act as voids in the material. Thus crack opening (in terms of void nucleation) and the subsequent crack growth (in terms of coalescence of new and existing voids) are captured naturally. The newly developed methodology to model crack opening has been applied to predict mode I crack growth around a notch tip in Cube and Brass oriented fcc single crystals. The obtained results show similar behaviours of crack growth with those from molecular dynamics simulations of single crystals having the same lattice orientations. The thodology to model crack opening that has been proposed in this thesis is original. It enables the explicit modelling of crack growth without presuming a crack path. Also, a predefined crack opening criterion, which could be erroneous, that has been used in many finite element simulations of fracture is avoided. To the best of the author&#8217;s knowledge, the criterion of crack opening that depends on the structure of the interface of two misoriented lattices is presented in this study for the first time. The current thesis focuses into modelling tensile deformation and the subsequent fracture in fcc crystals. The methodology that has been proposed however can be readily applied to crystalline materials of various lattice structures with minor modifications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3071</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming life opportunities and learning: stories of career change from mature age students in an Australian university</field><field name="creator">Li, Tao</field><field name="description">Since the early 1980s, neo-liberal economics or economic liberalism has become a dominant ideology impacting on Australian modern public policies including education. Globalization, technology advancement and free markets with minimal government interference have contributed to uncertainty in the Australian labour market that has posed risks in employment. An ethos of equality in educational opportunities for all and job insecurity has led to growing numbers of mature age students entering Australian universities in recent years.The main purpose of this research is to explore why mature age students enter university after working for several years. In addition, the experiences of these students as they study at university as well as their perceptions about higher education in relation to employment are examined. A qualitative, narrative inquiry was employed to investigate the integration of higher education and career development among mature age students. Five mature age students from a range of faculties in the University of Gold Coast participated in the study. Face-to-face interviews, email discussions and document reviews provide the consistency of evidence across sources of data. The five stories with a thick description of the participants&#8217; experiences ensured the credibility of the research findings of the study.  The outcome of the study illustrates that these mature age students believed that higher education could provide them with opportunities that could transform their lives. Engaging in higher education allowed them to pursue goals that would make them feel happy, fulfilled and empowered while meeting a range of social commitments. Most importantly, they developed a sense of agency after they succeeded through a very difficult process and grew in confidence. However, their anxiety for the future was not totally removed due to the expected gap between higher education and the labour market. The study overall provides insights and guidelines for learning and career development of mature age students, and this will benefit both mature age students and higher education institutions. The major implications for universities from this study is they need to recognize mature age students as a special group and this means that their demands for career services, entry pathways to higher education and work-base learning are different from younger age students. For mature age students, they need to positively take advantage of the valuable resources of their rich life and work experience in the uncertain labour market.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3049</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pointy shoes and pith helmets: dress and identity construction in Ambon from 1850 to 1942</field><field name="creator">Hulsbosch, Marianne</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores identity construction through an analysis of clothing during the last century of Dutch colonial rule in the central Moluccan islands of Indonesia. It addresses a gap in knowledge about dress and adornment in the main island of Ambon. This interdisciplinary investigation crosses sociocultural studies and history. It outlines the presence of Europeans in the eastern corner of the Indonesian archipelago since the sixteenth century when they secured trading routes of the fabled spices nutmeg, pepper and mace. Initially the Portuguese, and during the seventeenth century the Dutch, managed to establish a monopoly on the growing and purchase of cloves. The central Moluccan islands, and in particular Ambon, became one of the main trading posts. Thanks to the longstanding involvement of the Dutch East India trading company (VOC) and the Dutch government there is an exceptionally large amount of resources such as government documentation and reports, photographs, ethnographic and scientific information available for researching the life in the central Moluccan islands. However, sustained investigation into material culture and outward expression is notably absent.The Ambonese people occupied a special place in Dutch colonial times, and their unique social, political and religious position was registered on their bodies through specific items of clothing and dress combinations. Western superiority over local Ambonese was emphasised through technological advancement, religious sobriety, social sophistication, economic dominance and superior technologies of dress and body maintenance. This enforced a visual separation in appearance between the Ambonese and Europeans. Colonialism fostered a strong desire among indigenous Ambonese to nurture ethnic ideals of identity and in doing so both Ambonese and colonists continuously redefined position and class through clothing and adornment.This research describes unique items of clothing and their particular usage that clearly indicated membership of various layers of indigenous, ethnic Christian and ethnic Muslim Ambonese society, as well as social order within Dutch colonial culture.In this research I argue that the identity of the colonised and the coloniser was mediated by embodied social and cultural experiences. Intricate fashions of dress emphasised the relationship that links the body with the dynamic interplay of various power structures in, and between, dominant and subordinate colonial societies. Contemporary thought has shown how bodies are socially constituted and situated in culture. In contrast to Foucauldian concepts of societal response I argue that identity formation via dress practice is an interactive social construction that helps shape society. Drawing on the work of Entwistle (2000) and Wilson (1985) who argue for dress as a &#8216;situated embodied practice&#8217;&#8218; I use Arthur Frank&#8217;s &#8216;Typology of Body Use in Action&#8217; model (Frank 1991:54) as a conceptual framework to facilitate my approach. I demonstrate how this model provides an analytical theory as a basis of sociocultural enquiry into dress experience (embodiment) and intent (usage) in the context of space and time in order to define material identity construction in a colonial milieu.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/373</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of synthesis, structures and superconducting properties of magnesium diboride MgB2</field><field name="creator">Yao, Qiwen</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we are mainly discussing element-doped MgB&#8322;thick films and tapes. In Chapter 1, I present some brief discussions about superconductivity and its relevant theories and history. Extensive examples are given for superconductor applications. At Chapter 2, a literature Review of MgB&#8322;superconductor is given. In this chapter, MgB&#8322;&#8217;s discovery, particulars and current research are discussed. In Chapter 3, the experimental details and relevant laboratory measurement equipments are introduced; specifically X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements are discussed. From Chapter 4 through Chapter 7, various methods of MgB&#8322; thick film/short tape fabrication were discussed, as well as the corresponding results. At Chapter 4, we studied the Cu and Nano-SiC doped MgB&#8322; thick films on Ni substrates processed using a very short-time, in-situ reaction. Pure and doped MgB&#8322; thick films were fabricated on Ni substrates with varying amounts of elemental Cu and Nano-SiC powders, samples were sintering at 840&#176;C or 900&#176;C for just a few minutes, and then quenched in liquid nitrogen. We found that for films sintered at 900&#176;C, critical current densities Jc were achieved as high as 1.4 &#215; 106 A/cm&#178; at 20 K and 2 T for the pure and SiC added films. Films doped with 5 wt% of Cu powders were observed to have better adherence to the Ni substrate without degradation in Tc, and Jc was found to be slightly decreased, but still remains as high as 7 &#215; 105 A/cm&#178; at 20 K in zero field. It was observed that Jc and irreversibility field increase with an increasing sintering temperature up to 900&#176;C. Furthermore, Nano-SiC addition has significantly improved the irreversibility field compared to un-doped MgB&#8322; films. In Chapter 5, the effect of nano-Y-ZrO&#8322; (YSZ) addition on the microstructure and critical current density of MgB&#8322; superconductors was studied. XRD results showed that YSZ does not react with MgB&#8322;. Furthermore, the transition temperatures of the YSZ Nano-particle doped samples dropped about 3 K compared to the un-doped samples. Samples doped with YSZ powders showed a higher critical current density in low magnetic fields, however the Jc drops faster compared to that made by long time sintering samples. It is proposed that the improved Jc in low fields was due to the enhanced density of the sample, which was caused by the YSZ Nano-particle inclusion. In Chapter 6, I discuss the fabrication, microstructure and critical current density of pure and Cu doped MgB&#8322; thick films on Cu, Ni and stainless steel substrates by short-time, in-situ reaction. These thick films were prepared using a short time sintering method. Results showed that single MgB&#8322; phase films can be easily formed in a short period of time (3 minutes) at temperatures above 700&#176;C. Un-doped MgB&#8322; films were found to be loosely attached to the Ni and stainless steel substrates. However, the MgB&#8322; with Cu powders addition adhered well to the substrates without serious degradation of Tc and flux pinning. The Jc increased by one order of magnitude and irreversibility field determined from M-H loops also increased when sintering temperature increased from 745&#176;C to 900&#176;C. Jc values in the range of 1-9 x 105 A/cm2 at 15 K have been achieved for both doped and un-doped films sintered at 900&#176;C for a short 3 minutes of time. Finally at Chapter 7, I look at the significant improvement of critical current density in Cu sheathed MgB&#8322; tapes through Nano-SiC doping and short-time in-situ reaction. We found that Nano-SiC doping samples resulted in a very high critical current density of more than 1 MA per square centimetre in zero field at T &#8804; 10 K. It is also found that these Nano-SiC doped MgB&#8322; /Cu tapes exhibited very small flux jumping at 5 K, indicating a high thermal stability. Such a high Jc field performance together with high thermal stability and large mechanical flexibility makes the Cu-sheathed MgB&#8322; tapes an attractive candidate for large scale applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/404</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation in Indonesian language teaching: an evaluation of the TIFL tertiary curriculum materials</field><field name="creator">Read, Julia Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This dissertation evaluates the TIFL (Teaching Indonesian as a Foreign Language) tertiary curriculum materials. The TIFL tertiary curriculum materials were produced by a project which was initiated by the Asian Studies Council, funded by the then Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training, and implemented at the University of New South Wales in 1992-1994. This study is the first research related to the TIFL materials.The TIFL materials are the most wide-ranging and comprehensive instructional materials that have ever been produced for tertiary Indonesian. They are also highly innovative materials for teaching Indonesian at tertiary level because they are designed according to the communicative approach to language teaching (CLT). The available curriculum materials in the past have been based on either the grammar-translation or the audiolingual approach.Communicative competence theory provides the theoretical framework for the study. Canale and Swain&#8217;s adaptation of Hymes&#8217; original formulation of the theory has been accepted as the theoretical base of this study, in which  communicative competence consists of grammatical, sociocultural, discourse and strategic competence, as overlapping and interactive rather than discrete components. The implication for language pedagogy is that teaching communicatively entails the inclusion of skills that were previously not included in language curriculum design. Littlewood&#8217;s identification of four domains of skill that equate to the four components of CC has been accepted in this study as the basis of CLT. These are skill in manipulating the linguistic system, awareness of the social meanings of language forms and ability to choose appropriate ones, an understanding of language forms as a communicative system, and skills and strategies for using language to communicate meanings as effectively as possible in reallife situations. A communicative methodology (CM) has been developed by theoreticians and practitioners to teach these skills which has five unique characteristics that constitute innovations to the repertoire of language pedagogy. These have been identified by Johnson and Johnson as emphasis on sociolinguistic appropriateness, message-focus rather than focus on linguistic correctness, activation of psycholinguistic processes favourable to language acquisition, encouragement of risk-taking rather than  thoroughness and correctness, and free practice techniques to provide opportunities for learners to marshall subskills in holistic combination. Littlewood&#8217;s and Johnson and Johnson&#8217;s criteria have been used as the basis for evaluating the TIFL materials as communicative teaching materials.A critical evaluation of the materials in terms of theory was considered to be insufficient for this study because of two considerations. First, as the design of the TIFL project made no provision for evaluation, this was to be the first and possibly the only investigation of it. Therefore it was thought important to provide a historical record of how the project was conceived and implemented, and in particular how the problems and compromises that eventuated impacted on the final result. Second, as the TIFL materials are for classroom use, it was thought necessary to include observations of how they are actually used in universities and of their effectiveness as communicative curriculum materials in practice. There are thus historical and empirical as well as theoretical aspects to the study.The study has two research questions: (1) Do the TIFL materials embody a coherent application of communicative competence theory and the communicative approach to language teaching? (2) Do the TIFL materials, in use, promote communicative teaching and learning of Indonesian?The research design is case study method. This was chosen because it is a robust and flexible method suited to studies such as this that are exploratory in nature, and in which the phenomenon under investigation is embedded in a real-life situation with many variables that cannot be controlled. A further advantage of case study method is that it allows a variety of different types of data. In addition to the analysis of the TIFL materials in terms of CC theory and the pedagogical practices of CLT, this study includes data from archival materials, interviews with TIFL materials designers and users of the TIFL materials, ie, lecturers and students from eight universities, and classroom observations. The classroom observations include ethnographic observations and observations using the COLT (Communicative Orientation of Language Teaching) observation scheme. ISLPR (International Second Language Proficiency Ratings) assessments were also obtained from students at three universities where the TIFL materials form the basis of the Indonesian curriculum.It is found that the materials do in the main embody a coherent application of CC theory and CLT. The way that they are implemented at the University of NSW, where they were developed, was however found to contain elements such as drilling that are not normal components of CM. There are a number of other findings that are of interest as well. One is that the outcomes in terms of proficiency ratings are very similar in three universities where the TIFL materials are used as the basis of the curriculum. Another is that students learning Indonesian have extremely varied interests and learning preferences, but that the thematic nature of the TIFL materials made them acceptable to learners with a wide variety of interests and learning styles. The implications of these findings are that the TIFL materials are highly suitable as the basis for tertiary Indonesian programs because they produce reliable proficiency outcomes and are well-liked by students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/335</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"One bank, two cultural identities": a case study of Chinese and British influence on the financial practices of HSBC bank</field><field name="creator">Hui, Freda C. F</field><field name="description">After over 150 years of British rule, Hong Kong transferred its sovereignty to the Republic of China in 1997 under the catchcry of &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221;. The most dominant bank in Hong Kong (1864-present) is the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). This thesis explains the ensuing impact of the political and cultural change on the disclosures and accountability of HSBC.HSBC&#8217;s accounting practices are not independent and self-contained. They are shaped by HSBC&#8217;s unique history and culture, and are dependent on societal expectations. Hong Kong became a British colony in 1842. The handover in 1997 brought to the fore differences in expectations and cross-cultural differences between the West and the East. Annual reports were increasingly used by the bank as a tool to legitimate HSBC with respect to societal expectations and maintain its reputation as a reliable &#8220;local&#8221; bank in Hong Kong. This study demonstrates how a bank uses financial reports politically to ensure survival and sustainability beyond the rhetoric of accountability.The contributions of the thesis are twofold. First, it theoretically develops links between Laughlin&#8217;s (1995) Middle Range Thinking (MRT) and Institutional theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). Skeletal theory guides and facilitates the discourse necessary for analyses of political, economic, and social influences on accounting and banking. Secondly, this thesis applies methodology and methods novel to research in banking to enable a contextual understanding of the Asia Pacific regulatory environments. Both qualitative and quantitative methods of investigation are employed. Because of the complexity of the situation of HSBC, an intersubjective approach to theorising is necessary to interrogate historical and cultural impacts.This thesis critiques the &#8220;one country, two systems&#8221; policy as it applies to the banking sector in Hong Kong. The case study of HSBC demonstrates that some significant events triggered the additional public disclosure in annual reports and public accountability in order for HSBC to legitimate itself to the new Hong Kong order and mainland China expectations. This new approach is valuable in this banking study because it gives a different perspective on acquiring banking knowledge. Blending Middle Range Thinking and Institutional theory is shown to compensate for the deficiencies in both theories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/348</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the effectiveness of corporate web sites: an experimental study of the web acceptance model</field><field name="creator">Suh, Koo-Won</field><field name="description">There has been an ongoing need for designing and assessing corporate Web sites as important marketing communication tools. Typically, most research on Web site effectiveness has adopted traditional advertising evaluation models. A fundamental shortcoming of this approach is that it does not provide much information about user interaction. As corporate Web sites are new interactive media and Web user characteristics are far different from those of traditional communication media, new approaches should be developed. To overcome the inherent shortcomings of previous research, this study has developed a new theoretical framework, the Web Acceptance Model (WAM), which explores customer acceptance and uses of corporate Web sites. This study took an interdisciplinary approach involving theory derived from Marketing, Communication, Information Systems (IS), Education, and Psychology. The model is premised on two central phenomena of Web-Mediated Communication (WMC): social interaction between Web sites and users, and the active participation of users. In the model, the phenomenon of social interaction is captured by the inclusion of moderating variables: affective and task-related interaction which can help explain &#8220;why&#8221; a specific type of Web site is likely to be more effective. It is unlikely that a particular type of Web site will be effective all of the time. Therefore, this model also seeks to explain &#8220;when&#8221; a Web site is more likely to effective. Individual user difference as a moderator can help explain &#8220;when&#8221; and reflects the active role of customers in WMC. Finally, the model addresses all three elements of consumer attitudes i.e., affective, cognitive, and conative. Specifically, the model includes predictor, moderator, mediator, and criterion variables. The predictor (independent) variables are Web site content and structure. Content analysis was used to identify Web site typology in terms of structure and content. It was necessary to conduct an empirical study of Web site typology, as there was no published research on this topic. Empirically derived typology may better explain real world phenomena than a conceptually developed typology. Through content analysis of around 386 corporate Web sites, this study identified two types of Web site structure (&#8220;hypermedia&#8221; and &#8220;static image&#8221;) and two types of content (&#8220;integrated communication&#8221; and &#8220;basic image&#8221;). The criterion variables, which are the communication effects achieved by a Web site, are measured in terms of overall attitude toward the Web site and revisit intention. Among three mediators between the predictor and criterion variables, &#8220;social presence&#8221; serves as an affective bridge, while &#8220;perceived usefulness&#8221; and &#8220;perceived ease of use&#8221; serve as cognitive bridges. Finally, Web literacy serves as a moderator, which affects the direction and strength of the relationships between the predictors and mediators. The overall purpose of this study was to uncover the distinguishing features of effective corporate Web sites (i.e., those sites which are seen by users to be attractive, userfriendly and useful). To do this, the study sought to answer two exploratory questions and test hypotheses derived from the model. The exploratory questions were: (1) What content and structural elements are presented on corporate Web sites? and (2) How can corporate Web sites be classified according to their content and structure? These questions were answered through a preliminary content analysis of corporate Web sites. Fourteen hypotheses were derived to answer the three experimental research questions: (1) How do consumers respond to different types of Web site? (2) Do user attitudes toward corporate Web sites vary according to Web literacy levels? and (3) What features of corporate Web sites determine revisit intention amongst Web users? The first five hypotheses addressed how customers respond to different types of Web sites. The next five hypotheses examined what features of corporate Web sites determine revisit intention amongst Web users. The final four hypotheses investigated whether user attitudes toward corporate Web sites vary according to their Web literacy levels. These hypotheses were tested through a laboratory experiment. This study employed a 2 (Web site structure) &#215; 2 (Web site content) between-subject factorial design, with Web literacy serving as a co-variant. Each subject was allowed to explore only one of four specially constructed Web sites. Subjects were randomly assigned to each cell. The data was gathered through a self-report instrument, of which validity and reliability were ensured by a rigorous two-stage pilot test. Empirical evidence was gathered from one hundred and sixty students at the University of Wollongong in Australia who were recruited for the experiment. The data was analysed using the statistical methods of MANCOVA, ANCOVA, ANOVA, Multiple Linear Regression, and Simple Linear Regression. In terms of Web site content, it was found that the integrated communication type of Web site was more effective than the basic information type. The integrated type had higher social presence and perceived usefulness. In relation to Web site structure, it was found that the hypermedia type was more effective than the static image type, generating higher social presence and perceived usefulness. The results of this investigation suggest that social presence and perceived usefulness were critical factors that explain &#8220;why&#8221; a specific type of Web site is more effective than the other type. The more positive social presence and perceived usefulness were, the higher attitude toward the Web site was, and in turn, the higher revisit intention was. However, there was no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and attitude toward the Web site. It was also concluded that Web literacy moderate the relationship between Web structure and social presence. For example, people who with low Web literacy experienced higher differences in social presence between static image type and hypermedia type than those with high Web literacy. These results imply that both Web site structure and content had effects on consumer attitude and the two dimensions of social interaction (i.e., social presence and perceived usefulness) are critical factors for identifying consumer responses to Web sites. One of the interesting findings was the importance of an emotional response, meaning that it is not possible to fully explain consumer behaviour without the understanding of emotional responses to Web sites. The Web Acceptance Model provides a new way of conceptualising social interaction, which is central to WMC, and underlines the importance of an interdisciplinary research to our understanding of WMC. Therefore, it is hoped that this study will make a significant contribution to a burgeoning area of research that is of great and increasing importance to both the discipline and the practice of marketing.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An intimate monument (re)-narrating 'the troubles' in Northern Ireland: the Irish Linen Memorial 2001-2005</field><field name="creator">Trouton, Lycia Danielle</field><field name="description">The Irish Linen Memorial creative project is an ongoing site conscious memorial installation which seeks to re narrate the almost 4,000 deaths which took place during the fraught period in contemporary Northern Ireland, called &#8216;the troubles&#8217;. The dead, far from being gone, remain as a powerful part of the community. How we think about the dead, and the stories we tell about the relationship between the dead and the living, are central to imagining new forms of community and narratives of nationhood. An intimate, yet public, monument to those killed, The Irish Linen Memorial is created on white, linen handkerchiefs, with the names printed and overstitched with embroidery, and spotted with sewn hair. As an adjunct to this counter monument, I constructed a personal installation on the subject of &#8216;mending&#8217;, developed through a residency at The Gunnery studios in Woolloomooloo, Sydney. In addition to The Irish Linen Memorial, in 2002 and 2004, I invited fellow artists to dialogue with the work that, in turn, produced a dance theatre performance and a seven channel sonic surround original music composition. As well, in 2005, new media components were a part of the installation. In all, this project comprises this exegesis, several gallery installations, a DVD that documents the artwork and a portfolio of images in a booklet. The exegesis outlines the complexities of a hybrid memorial grounded equally in contemporary sculpture and textiles. I have outlined the historical context of the material culture of linen and presented a general overview of the socio political landscape of contemporary Northern Ireland from a feminist postcolonial perspective. My case studies center on how installation artists tackle socio political issues of national concern. The thesis exegesis reflects upon the new theoretical positionings of feminist theory in relation to sculpture and textiles, text and textiles, feminist theories of the public and the private, the greater visibility of the migrant artist, in particular, the self consciousness of the migrant artist in Australia, together with the increasing conflation of High/Low, Art/Craft arts practice into an elastic hybridity. The case studies I examine to explore these themes are the work of USA artists Richard Serra (b. 1939) and Maya Lin (b. 1959); in particular Lin&#8217;s Vietnam Veteran&#8217;s Memorial, 1982, an anti monument on a reconciliatory theme of national importance, and Serra&#8217;s Tilted Arc, 1979 89, a courageous exposition of the working chiasmatic power of a federal, pedestrian plaza. My other case studies are contemporary artists Narelle Jubelin (Australian, currently based in Spain, b. 1960) and Doris Salcedo (Colombian, educated in New York City, b. 1958), whose installation artwork is based in sculpture and textiles, and both of whom address touch as an important component of their work. Jubelin addresses national issues through the extreme juxtaposition of petit point needlework with large scale architectonic forms. Salcedo works with art as a witness, re configuring furniture and clothing, leaving the viewer with the affect of the terror, grief and trauma of living with daily political violence. The dimensions of this book are the size of the handkerchief used in the creative project. The side bar of the exegesis acts as a reminder of the central concern of my artwork from 2001 &#8211; 2005: honouring equally all those killed in the troubles, listed chronologically. Thus, the exegesis becomes another artwork: a site, displaced and conveniently mobile, as is The Irish Linen Memorial and the book upon which it is based, Lost Lives: the stories of the men, women and children who died as a result of the troubles, 2000. The exegesis seeks to pick, unpick and rethread a sense of the fragile, recuperative work involved in a community emerging from conflict, the place of my birth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/779</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the coalface : identity implications of performance appraisal at an underground coal mine</field><field name="creator">McLean, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the reasons for negative employee responses to performance appraisal at an underground coal mine in Australia. Through analysis of processes of identity construction and defence among coal miners, the thesis advances understanding of how blue-collar employees react to receiving comparative performance ratings. Using an extended case study method over a five year period, the fieldwork investigated the discursive resources that miners used to make sense of this orthodox human resource management practice. By combining insights from critical discourse analysis and critical management studies approaches, the thesis analyses the effects of appraisal upon miners&#8217; occupational identity and provides empirical evidence of the inventive powers of such workers to prise open spaces for workplace resistance through identity (re)construction processes. A synthesis of conceptual frameworks pertaining to performance appraisal, discursive concepts, subjects and objects, and identity regulation and identity work, provides a more comprehensive understanding of employee responses to managerial initiatives such as performance appraisal. Miners used a palette of discursive resources, including storytelling and dissonance tropes to make sense of, and subvert, the negative effects of individuating performance appraisals on their occupational identity. The thesis questions the power neutral assumptions of mainstream human resource management practice, and suggests that managers who ignore the subjective effects of disciplining technologies such as appraisal may experience unintended consequences as workers resist identity disruptions in the workplace.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/654</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous diasporic literature : representations of the Shaman in the works of Sam Watson and Alootook Ipellie</field><field name="creator">McMahon-Coleman, Kimberley</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to bring together postcolonial and diaspora theories to look at the work of two Indigenous writers. It explores how complexities of postcolonial representation may be analysed by viewing Indigenous populations in Canada and Australia as members of intra-national diasporas, with the mission sites being fashioned as diaspora spaces. The figures that populate these spaces are never quite at home in their host communities, and are also unable to return completely to the homelands of their imaginations. This thesis argues that the defining features of Indigenous diasporic literature are the creation of maban realism and queer figures. Indigenous diasporic texts feature supernatural events and characters, are strongly political, and force mainstream readers into unfamiliar reading positions. The two texts examined here, Alootook Ipellie&#8217;s Arctic Dreams and Nightmares and Sam Watson&#8217;s The Kadaitcha Sung, achieve this through the use of shamanic protagonists. Each author&#8217;s work conforms to a mainstream readership&#8217;s expectations in terms of the type of narrative told, yet the texts queer many literary conventions. Ipellie&#8217;s stories return to the stereotype of, in his words, the &#8220;quaint Eskimo,&#8221; whilst Watson&#8217;s is, at heart, a Stolen Generations narrative. Perhaps ironically, each writer has used an established narrative which is the antithesis of his own lived experience, suggesting that even as he sought to carve out a space and a means of telling Indigenous stories that may have otherwise remained untold, that space was still being delineated by colonial history. In these works, the shaman is an Indigenous diasporic voice&#8212;a way of telling Indigenous stories in difficult political environments. The Indigenous diasporic framework provides a means of analysing such stories, which utilise imagery from two conflicting cultures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/786</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental impacts and the ecology of sponges and ascidians in south-eastern Australian coastal lakes and lagoons</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Peter Brendan</field><field name="description">Estuaries worldwide are under threat from urbanisation and development and will need effective management for their successful conservation. Coastal lakes and lagoons have been identified as one of the estuary types most susceptible to human impacts largely because of their isolated nature and slow flushing times. Management of estuaries will be most effective when based on a sound scientific understanding of the patterns of distribution, biology and ecology over the full range of biodiversity of these systems, however, such an understanding is lacking for many systems and many taxa. Studies of sponges and ascidians in coastal lakes and lagoons are rare compared to other taxa, particularly in the southern hemisphere. This study represents the first detailed scientific investigation of the ecology of sponges and ascidian in coastal lakes and lagoons of southeastern Australia. Consequently, a large part of this thesis was devoted to quantifying basic patterns of distribution. I started with a pilot study to develop an effective sampling design, followed by large-scale comparisons among different types of lake, comparisons among habitats within lakes and an environmental impact study. I concluded with a manipulative experiment to examine processes responsible for smallscale patterns of distribution of sponges in seagrass meadows.In the pilot study, distributions of sponges and ascidians were quantified at a hierarchy of three spatial scales in each of two coastal lakes. Nested analyses of variance were then used to identify spatial scales at which variation was significant. Most sponges and ascidians were very patchily distributed at a range of spatial scales from 10s of metres up to 100s of kilometres. Unlike other published examples of cost&#8211; benefit analyses, very few taxa were widespread over the larger spatial scales. Cost&#8211; benefit analyses done to determine the optimal sampling design revealed inclusion of patchily distributed taxa in analyses improved the overall precision of sampling for comparisons of assemblages among lakes.Large-scale comparisons of assemblages of sponges and ascidians were made among lakes of different size (big versus small), opening regime (mostly open to the ocean versus mostly closed) and level of environmental modification (extensively modified versus more pristine). Similar to other taxa studied in coastal lakes, in general there were more species in lakes mostly open to the ocean compared to the mostly closed lakes, and importantly, no sponges and only one species of ascidian was found in the small closed lakes. There also appeared to be an effect of the level of modification of a lake with relatively smaller abundances of ascidians in extensively modified lakes, and a complete absence of sponges from one of the extensively modified lakes.Habitat-associated patterns were examined at smaller spatial scales by comparing the distributions of sponges and ascidians with the species composition and percentage cover of seagrass and macroalgae within two lakes; St Georges Basin and Wallis Lake. Several patterns of association were observed, but these varied among species of sponge and ascidian. In St Georges Basin, the most common sponge, Aplysinella cf. rhax and the native ascidian Pyura stolonifera were positively correlated with the seagrass, Posidonia australis. In contrast, the introduced ascidian, Styela plicata was more abundant in areas dominated by the seagrass, Zostera capricorni. In Wallis Lake, sponges were most diverse and some species most abundant in large beds of the macroalga, Lamprothamnion sp., while other sponges were found only on the holdfasts of brown macroalgae. In both lakes, sponges were generally less common in areas dominated by dense meadows of the seagrass, Zostera capricorni.Among the many anthropogenic impacts threatening the ecology of coastal lakes, the discharge of cooling water from coal-fired power stations represents an almost ideal case study from which to develop appropriate sampling regimes for detecting impacts on sponges and ascidians. Using reference locations both within and outside Lake Macquarie which has two cooling water outlets, I found assemblages of sponges and ascidians were often more diverse, more abundant and less temporally variable near to the outlets compared to reference locations.Based on the observation that the sponge, Suberites sp. which contains photosynthetic symbionts was absent from meadows of dense Zostera capricorni, I used in situ manipulative experiments in Smiths Lake to investigate processes which maybe affecting their distribution. Individual Suberites sp. were shaded, had water flow reduced and were transplanted into areas of dense Z. capricorni. There were no measurable short-term effects of shading or reduced water flow, but transplanted sponges were quickly eaten and I concluded predation by fish was likely to be a key process determining small-scale patterns of distribution of Suberites sp. in seagrass meadows. This result was in stark contrast to the majority of previous studies of the effects of seagrass habitat complexity on predation which have found predation to decrease with increasing density or complexity.In conclusion, I have sought to provide sound scientific information to aid in the management of these systems. A simple, but nevertheless key finding was that sponges and ascidians are indeed present and widespread in coastal lakes and lagoons of southeastern Australia and should not be continually overlooked in the management and conservation of these systems. Conservation will be complex and requires an understanding of environmental impacts and the consequences of management on the full range of biodiversity. The distributions of sponges and ascidians at large &#8216;lakewide&#8217; scales appear to behave similarly to other taxa. Management strategies which change the characteristics of a lake at these large spatial scales such as artificial openings of entrances could therefore be predicted to have similar effects across a range of taxa including sponges and ascidians. In contrast, at smaller spatial scales such as the complexity of seagrass meadows, some species of sponges and ascidians may behave very differently from other taxa. At present, our understanding of these naturally variable and complex systems is incomplete and will require ongoing scientific investigation to identify natural patterns of distribution, environmental impacts, important natural processes and the ecological consequences of management strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/849</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the reception of aboriginal art in German art space</field><field name="creator">Krishnabhakdi-Vasilakis, Friederike</field><field name="description">German art history and ethnology have led to a binary reading of art that has inhibited the exhibition of Aboriginal art as contemporary art in the twentieth and early twenty-first century. This thesis addresses the question of how Australian Aboriginal art is displayed in the institutional spaces of art galleries and museums in Germany. I argue that there is an underlying current in Germany that divides the representation of art into European and &#8220;other&#8221;, particularly Aboriginal art. Within German culture, ethnological museums are ranked differently from art institutional spaces. The art museum or gallery is at the top of the hierarchy, enhancing the self-reflexive notion of culture, while the ethnological museum provides the context against which European, specifically German, identity and culture are pitched. Aboriginal art that is contextualised as ethnographic and not as contemporary continues a Modernist perspective on cultural exchange, one that emphasises an essential difference between European and non-European art in a universal progress of humanity. This essentialising of culture in Germany does not reflect the globalised situation that evokes regional cultural inflections based on experiences and expressions of hybridity and fragmentation.In order to understand how German art institutions and ethnographic museums stand for a Eurocentric art discourse, the thesis analyses the cultural parameters of nineteenth century Germany, the socio-political cataclysm of the Third Reich in the twentieth century, and the reversion to Modernism in its aftermath. In comparison, I outline the exhibition history and reception of Aboriginal art in Australia where the positioning of Indigenous and European traditions has shifted markedly into a postcolonial, postmodern situation since the1980s. My study investigates this categorisation into two entities through Western concepts of literacy and orality. Since the Enlightenment, the Western emphasis on alphabetic literacy as a system superior to oral transmission of knowledge has governed the way we make sense of the world around us. The written word underpins modes of exhibition display and reception, so that representation is read as text. As a consequence, institutions and galleries, as part of visual culture, treat knowledge that is transmitted orally as inferior. This thesis explores strategies that allow the viewing of art outside the conventions of the written word.I examine the modes of display and reception of Aboriginal art through fundamental ideas first put forward by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), and also through Michel Foucault&#8217;s The Order of Things (1970). My main focus, however, relates to Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s concepts surrounding Cultural Capital, Symbolic Capital and Symbolic Violence in his publications The Field of Cultural Production (ed. Randal Johnson 1993) and Language and Symbolic Power (trans. by Gino Raymond and Matthew Adamson 1991) which allow an analysis of power relations in cultural exchange within the hierarchies of art institutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3029</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the condition monitoring of large slow speed slew bearings</field><field name="creator">Moodie, Craig A S</field><field name="description">The condition monitoring of slow speed roller bearings has been investigated. A test-rig was designed and constructed to enable detailed measurement of horizontal rotating bearing acceleration forces in both the axial and radial plane in the speed range of 0.5 to 10 revolutions per minute. These accelerations were carried out at both sonic and ultrasonic sampling rates to establish which technique is the most appropriate. Overall bearing displacement and surface temperatures were measured. Strains generated in the stress frame by the loading of the bearing were monitored along with the power used to drive the test-rig. Measurements were obtained from two full-size slew bearings operating in Bluescope Steel Limited. One bearing operated at 4.3 rpm continuously in the vertical plane. The other slew bearing operated intermittently and with partial rotation at approximately 1 rpm in the horizontal plane. During this project, the concepts of Symmetry and Stability have been developed as a fundamental approach to information analysis. A considerable number of novel signal processing methods including; Kurtosis/Correlation dimension plots, Symmetry State Space (SSS), Symmetric Wave Decomposition (SWD), Compressed Eigenvector Deconvolution Spectral Analysis (CEDSA), Ring Matrix Fault Values (RMFV) have been developed. These methods all utilize symmetry, antisymmetry, symmetry &#8217;breaking&#8217;, stability and enable the assessment of which sensor methodology combination is best for the situation considered. It will be shown, among other things, that ultrasonic measurements using sensors designed for Acoustic Emission (AE) permit an implementation of an early warning system for slow speed bearings. This will enable the operator to carry the minimum inventory in bearings and to plan shut downs without incurring additional costs from unplanned outages resulting from failed bearings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3035</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Security enhanced agent systems</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Qi</field><field name="description">Software agents are useful for distributed systems and electronic commerce. However, to fully deploy software agents in practice, a number of challenging issues, especially security and privacy, need to be addressed. In general, software agents can be classified into mobile agent and multi-agent, which have different security requirements.Mobile agents are mobile in the sense that they can move in the defined computer network. Due to this nature, security and privacy become critical. When a mobile agent travels in a hostile environment or migrates to an untrusted platform, its security and privacy can be easily compromised. In particular, the remote hosts in which agents visit and get services are not considered to be trusted. Existing solutions suggest that remote hosts together with the agent&#8217;s home jointly sign the service agreement. Therefore, proxy-based signing model was utilized. We observe that this actually poses a serious problem: a host which should be excluded from the desirable hosts could also generate a signed service agreement. In order to solve this problem, we propose a secure mobile agent transaction scheme which achieves host authentication with designated hosts. In our scheme, only selected hosts can be included in the agent network and hence generate a valid signed service agreement.  We also propose a variant of our scheme that provides a shorter signature size.Multi-agent systems are different from mobile agents systems in that they are not mobile. Although multi-agent systems do not have the security risks stemming from mobility, they have other security problems. Unfortunately, security and privacy issues have not been adequately addressed. Most proposed schemes only concern with security protection rather than privacy protection. Privacy issues have not drawn adequate attention and actually been ignored or mistreated in most proposed multi-agent protocols. We argue that privacy issues are indeed not trivial and cannot be resolved with traditional security mechanisms. If agents do not trust each other, their privacy must be protected. In order to solve the issue, we propose a novel secure multi-agent protocol which captures several most important security properties including data confidentiality, agent privacy and authenticity.In our scheme, privacy protection is applied to both negotiating parties (agents). The security protection in our scheme satisfies the most stringent security level, i.e., indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3072</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical analysis of plasma proteins by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Tadesse, Margey</field><field name="description">Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was assessed as a tool for the analysis of different glycosylated and iron forms of transferrin (tf).

Aims: (i) Monitor and evaluate Thailand&#8217;s national HIV mental health and psychosocial care program. (ii) Measure the impact of HIV mental and psychological care on health care providers. (iii) Examine the relationship between occupation-related psychological morbidity and the recruitment, training, clinical supervision and work-practices of HIV mental health service providers. (iv) Develop, implement and evaluate a training curriculum that addresses the demands of the HIV client population in Thailand.  Method: In Study 1, 826 government hospitals, 1000 government health centres, and 1135 non-government organisations and private providers participated in: semi-structured, key informant interviews; focussed group discussions; and criterion-referenced appraisals of health policy and service delivery.  Study 2, a small exploratory, qualitative study, utilised a schema of five key stressors commonly associated with HIV care to analyse responses gained from HIV counsellors and employed semi-structured interviews and focussed discussion groups. Study 3, a cross-sectional study, explored the relationship between training, work practices, Locus of Control of Behaviour and the self-reporting of signs and symptoms of psychological distress. 803 HIV counsellors completed a series of questionnaires including the Thai version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), the Locus of Control of Behaviour Questionnaire and the Thai HIV Counsellors Survey (THCS).  Study 4 involved the development, delivery and evaluation of a series of short courses designed to train 79 health workers to provide HIV counselling.  The training was evaluated by pre and post knowledge examinations and anonymous evaluations.  Results: Study 1 found that policy and legislation failed to adequately guide the practitioner in a number of key areas including: testing and counselling of minors; testing without informed consent; confidentiality of medical records and disclosure of HIV status; and &#8220;duty of care&#8221; in terms of threatened suicide or harm to others.  Furthermore, it was found that epidemiological data had not been adequately considered in terms of providing specific psychological support services, and developing counselling curriculum, and that the conduct of Thai based psychological and operations research had been limited. Whilst there was good national coverage of HIV testing counselling services, psychological services to address HIV issues across the disease continuum were limited and frequently provided by individuals without adequate training.  There does not appear to be any systematic mechanism for monitoring and evaluating HIV mental health and psychosocial care.  This study also revealed that Thailand is limited in its ability to provide adequate HIV field-experienced, trained mental health care personnel who can teach in the necessary languages that would enable sharing of the Thai health sector experience within the region.  Study 2: The respondents identified a number of workplace stressors including: fear of contagion; client-professional boundary issues; difficulties with being identified as working in the sphere of a highly stigmatised disease; the experience of multiple losses, in a context of perceived inadequate training; role expansion; and perceived lack of recognition and reward.  Participants also identified a number of work and socio-cultural influences which were perceived to mitigate the impact of the work.  Study 3: Failure to take up counselling duties after training was primarily associated with counsellors having too many competing non-counselling duties (31.2%; n=108), and being deployed to other workplaces in a non-counselling capacity (22.8%,n=79).  Over 81% (n=441) of respondents who indicated that they were continuing to work as counsellors reported signs and symptoms of psychological disturbance on the GHQ-28 screening at a level that warranted further mental health assessment. There was a significant positive correlation between GHQ-28 &#8220;caseness&#8221; and Locus of Control of Behaviour scores (r =.118; p&lt;.001).  Decisions to leave counselling were positively associated with self reported psychological disturbance (r =.324; p&lt;.001) and the perception that their work was not helpful to clients (r =.108; p&lt;.001).  Study 4:  The results clearly showed that the curriculum, and method of training resulted in both perceived and measured change in knowledge and skills and were reported to have resulted in improvements in the trainees&#8217; perceived self confidence to meet the demands of their clients.  Conclusion: The studies identified the many challenges inherent in providing effective HIV counselling, mental health and psychosocial services in Thailand.  This research suggests that delivering HIV psychosocial care services in Thailand has potentially an adverse impact on: the health and well being of care providers; the quality of care received by clients and patients; and ultimately on the ability of the health system to retain its skilled personnel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/73</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of nanostructured electrode materials for rechargeable lithium ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Park, Min Sik</field><field name="description">State-of-the-art rechargeable lithium-ion battery technology has now paved the way for advanced energy storage systems to take their place in a variety of portable electronics. High cell voltage, good cycle life, and an attractive combination of energy and power generation are on the verge of being guaranteed for high-power and large-scale applications, such as plug-in hybrid vehicles. This investigation examines the circumstances attending the development of the rechargeable lithium-ion battery, to seek a better understanding of the factors affecting its electrochemical performance. The major objective of this work is to determine the advantages and drawbacks of tin dioxide (SnO2) nanostructured materials as alternative anode materials and to suggest promising structural modifications in order to improve their electrochemical properties. Another important objective is to identify the correlation between electrochemical performance and particle size minimization in the lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) system, a promising cathode material, and to give further evidence supporting the incomplete room-temperature reaction mechanism. The selection and assembly of nanostructured materials have been considered as central issues in the development of alternative anode materials that possess higher capacity and better cyclic retention compared to commercial graphite. SnO2 has shown high capacity and a relatively low reaction potential with Li+, and is thus under consideration as a possible candidate for high-power and high-energy applications. We have synthesized various types of SnO2 nanostructured materials, such as nanopowders, nanowires, and nanotubes in this work, and their electrochemical properties have been carefully compared in order to demonstrate the effects of their morphological differences on the electrochemical performance, based on thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. By incorporating structural modifications into the SnO2 nanostructured materials, we have formed Carbon encapsulated SnO2 nanopowders and nanowires by simple decomposition of malic acid (C4H6O5) at low temperature, which effectively improved specific capacity and cyclic performance. Combining surfactant mediated synthesis and the sol&#8211;gel vacuum suction method, SnO2&#8211;mesoporous organo-silica nano-array (MOSN) nanocomposites were prepared for controlling the large volume variation of SnO2 during cycling, where the MOSN could act as a mechanical buffer, resulting in a strong enhancement of cyclic retention.On the other hand, the reaction mechanism and phase transition of LiFePO4 at room temperature have not been fully understood yet. In pursuit of extending our understanding, we have prepared LiFePO4/C nanocomposites with different particle sizes and characterized their fundamental crystal structure, which is directly related to the electrochemical behavior. Considering the fact that the room temperature phase diagram is essential to understand the facile electrode reaction of LixFePO4 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1), here, we have suggested experimental evidence for isolation of an intermediate solid solution phase at around x = 0.93 at room temperature, which strongly supports the incomplete miscibility gap model. More interestingly, the impacts of air exposure on the LiFePO4/C nanocomposites have been systematically investigated as a function of temperature. We found that Li+ could be spontaneously extracted from the host structure, even at room temperature under air atmosphere. This finding also can explain the room temperature phase transition of LiFePO4 and provide the reason for the undesirable Li+ loss that is induced by external factors at room temperature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/98</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Food Synergies: improving the effect of the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid on cardiovascular disease risk factors through concurrent dietary consumption of canola or soy isoflavones</field><field name="creator">Ridges, Leisa</field><field name="description">Ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are among the leading causes of death in Australian men and women with heart diseases being the third highest cause of death in Australian women and fourth highest cause of death in Australian men (AIHW, 2006). In Australia more than 50% of all adults have two or three (out of a possible nine) risk factors for cardiovascular disease and 15% having four or more risk factors. It has long been recognised that diet modification can reduce these risks. Recently dietary advice has moved from an &#8220;exclusionary&#8221; to an &#8220;inclusionary&#8221; paradigm. That is, rather than identify dietary items to avoid, current guidelines recommend incorporating advice to increase the consumption of a range of functional foods including marine sourced omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA and vegetable oils.  EPA and DHA are effective functional foods in reducing CVD mortality, cardiac death, sudden death and myocardial infarction. EPA and DHA provide this cardiovascular benefit by improving several risk factors including: fasting plasma triglycerides, blood pressure and arterial compliance. However, a safety concern of dietary EPA and DHA supplementation is their capacity to cause a significant increase in LDL cholesterol concentrations. Dietary intake levels of EPA and DHA in the Australian diet are well below those associated with reductions in CVD risk. In 50% of the population a potential 20 &#8211; fold increase in EPA and DHA would be required to increase intake levels to those commensurate with reduced CVD risk. While dietary supplementation with EPA and DHA is one means of increasing dietary intake levels, strategies to increase the efficacy of EPA and DHA would also be advantageous and could reduce supplement doses. Dietary strategies that could simultaneously counteract the rise in LDL cholesterol caused by DHA would also be beneficial. The research described in this thesis aimed to modify the bioavailability and cardiovascular effects of DHA by modifying other dietary factors and combining DHA with other active ingredients. To address these aims two human clinical trials were conducted. The first examined the effect of altering the types of oil and margarine consumed in the diet with view to reducing the dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids while supplementing the diet with DHA-rich fish oil (MOFO study). This study showed that replacing usual dietary oil and margarine with canola products while supplementing the diet with 1.1g/d of DHA favourably improved total omega-3 fatty acid incorporation and reduced the omega-6: omega-3 fatty acid ratio in plasma and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids as effectively as double the supplement dose of DHA. Additionally, there was a similar rise in erythrocyte membrane and plasma DHA when either safflower or sunola oil, which contain very different amounts of linoleic acid, were consumed concurrently with a daily dietary supplementation of 1.1g/d of DHA. A distinguishing feature of canola is its relatively high omega-3 ALA content. Thus, these findings add to the body of scientific evidence supporting the view that the total amount of dietary omega-3 consumed has greater impact on the bioavailability of supplemented DHA than the ratio of dietary omega-6: omega-3 fatty acids. The MOFO study also showed that the combination of canola plus 1.1g/d of DHA is equally as effective as daily supplementation with 2.2g/d of DHA at reducing fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations with the added benefit of preventing the significant rise in both LDL and total cholesterol caused by both doses of DHA alone. While further research is warranted based on the findings from animal studies, it can reasonably be proposed that the findings from the MOFO study may be an example of a synergistic effect of canola phytosterols and DHA, rather than ALA and DHA, working together to significantly reduce fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations while preventing detrimental effects on LDL cholesterol in people with mild hypertriglyceridemia. The second human clinical trial conducted as part of this thesis examined the effect of combining omega-3 fatty acids with soy isoflavones on fasting blood lipids, blood pressure and arterial compliance (Omega-Soy study). The Omega-Soy study showed that the combined consumption of DHA with soy isoflavones resulted in an 8-10% improvement in HDL cholesterol, an 18-20% reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations and the absence of a 10.8% rise in LDL cholesterol observed with DHA supplementation alone. Furthermore, the increases in LDL and total cholesterol observed with DHA supplementation in the first six weeks were reversed and significantly reduced when soy cereal was concurrently consumed. The results showed that the dietary combination of soy isoflavones and DHA improve the lipid profile of moderately hyperlipidemic individuals more favourably than either constituent alone. While further research is warranted based on evidence from in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal models demonstrating functional effects of soy isoflavones and DHA on lipid metabolism pathways, it can reasonably be proposed that the findings from the Omega-Soy study demonstrate a synergistic effect of soy isoflavones and DHA, working together to significantly reduce fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations without detrimental  effects on LDL cholesterol in people with mild hyperlipidemia. The findings from this thesis support two functional food synergies for effective improvement of blood lipid concentrations when consumed as part of the usual diet of men and postmenopausal women with moderately elevated blood lipids. These functional food combinations are DHA with canola and DHA with soy isoflavones. The findings of this thesis sheds some light on how isoflavones may be actively involved in reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations when consumed with soy protein or in soy containing foods, furthermore the findings of this thesis provide strategies for ultimately reducing the negative side effects of dietary DHA supplementation and for achieving a better outcome in overall lipid profile improvements than could be achieved with DHA supplementation alone. Future research into these synergistic combinations of functional food ingredients with DHA may lead to new directions in functional food development by food manufacturers to enable more consumers to manage their blood lipid concentrations with minimal or without drug therapy requirements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/218</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study into the effects of fission-fragment damage on activation energies in AG/Bi2223 tapes</field><field name="creator">Marinaro, Dami&#225;n</field><field name="description">Ag/Bi-2223 tapes doped with small quantities of highly enriched uranium were prepared by the powder-in-tube process and irradiated with thermal neutrons. The resulting fission fragments create randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects that provide strong flux pinning. Significant improvements in the field and angular dependence of the critical current density and in the irreversibility field were observed at 77 K, increasing with the density of fission tracks. In tapes with equivalent fission track density, the observed increases are larger for the samples exposed to larger neutron fluences (where a lower uranium doping level requires higher neutron fluence to obtain the same fission track density). This is explained as a result of the formation of secondary uranium-containing phases physically separated from the Bi2223 phase above a solubility limit to the uranium doping. An unusual exponential dependence of Hirr on the density of tracks was also observed, unrelated to the secondary phase formation. The primary investigation concerns the activation energies for vortex motion in the thermally activated flux flow and flux creep regimes, probed via resistive transition and dynamic magnetic relaxation measurements, which had not been previously explored. Both methods demonstrate the dominance of the fission tracks in the pinning landscape, particularly in fields applied parallel to the c-axis. Linearity in an Arrhenius plot of the superconductor resistance against temperature over at least three orders of magnitude indicated thermally activated flux motion in tapes with and without fission damage. In fields applied parallel to the c-axis, the pinning energy was substantially increased by the fission tracks, U0 tripling in magnitude at &#956;0H ~ 0.3 T, and then reconverging with the pre-irradiation U0 for &#956;0H &gt; 2 T. This behaviour of the activation energy is well described by an effective matching field Beff ~ 0.3 T, identified at the maximum in the relative change of U0 and also observed from changes in the behaviour of the resistively determined irreversibility field. This Beff is lower than the matching field B&#966; ~ 2.1 T estimated from the fission track density. Dynamic magnetic relaxation measurements were analysed using a modified form of Maley's method [M. P. Maley et al., Phys. Rev. B 42, p2639 (1990)]. This method was modified by using an empirically determined temperature scaling to resolve the current density dependence of the effective activation energy Ueff(J,H,T0) in the flux creep regime from different isothermal data points, over a wide range of temperatures and values of J. Correlated changes in the empirical temperature scaling form U(T), an additive constant C, a fitting parameter &#956; and the divergent behaviour of Ueff as J &#8594; 0 are all consistent with a dimensional crossover from 3D elastic to 2D plastic creep at fields &#956;0H &#8776; 0.37 T in a nonirradiated tape. The dimensional crossover was shifted to higher fields &#956;0H &#8776; 0.65 T after the introduction of fission-fragment damage, interpreted as evidence that the randomly splayed quasi-columnar defects promote c-axis vortex correlation in the Ag/Bi2223 tapes. Analysis of the relaxation data without the additional temperature scaling modification, on the other hand, produced a conflicting result, implying the complete destruction of c-axis vortex correlation over the entire field range explored. This observation is inconsistent with measurements of the current &#8211; voltage characteristics. Together with the unreasonable values of C obtained by this analysis and in comparison to the consistency observed with the empirically determined temperature scaling modification, the results indicate that the inclusion of the empirical temperature scaling is essential to an analysis of relaxation data. In comparison to past studies, we conclude that the efficiency of the uranium-fission method in enhancing the flux pinning is strongly dependent on the material anisotropy, through the vortex line elasticity and dimensionality, which hence affect the vortex line accommodation to the splayed defects. This has significant consequences for the estimation of B&#966; in materials with differing anisotropy. The present method of calculating B&#966; directly from the fission track density multiplied by the average defect track length is an oversimplification, which does not take into account the finite elasticity of the flux lines as well as the anisotropy of the vortex system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/324</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-resident cinema: transnational audiences for Indian films</field><field name="creator">Athique, Adrian Mabbott</field><field name="description">In this thesis the popular Indian film is described as an object of global significance. It is argued that understanding Indian films on a global scale requires different governing structures to existing paradigms of national media research and that, in particular, this requires a focus upon the consumption, rather than the production, of cinema. This thesis will also argue that the Australian media environment is constituted by a complex matrix of transnational cultural flows that spread beyond the boundaries of nationalist discourse, and that understanding the social dynamics of cinema in Australia requires an intellectual engagement with the phenomenon of globalisation.This thesis seeks to locate the cultural geography of Indian films in a global context before presenting a local case study that draws on a body of interviews and survey exercises conducted during 2003-04 with film-viewers and media professionals in the Greater Sydney and Illawarra regions of New South Wales, Australia. My immediate concern is with the manner in which Indian movies reach an audience within this social environment and how that audience is described, both by themselves and by those who seek to cater to them. Thus, a further intention of this study overall is to conduct a reevaluation of the nature of the social imagination which has been assumed to operate around participation in communities defined by media use. This study therefore combines three major points of enquiry: Indian films as globally dispersed media artefacts, Australia as a site of complex transnational cultural practices, and media audiences as sites of relational social imagination. The theoretical framework that I advance here reformulates the conception of media audiences as &#8216;imagined communities&#8217; by replacing a demographically constituted ethnographic model with an emphasis on surveying the diverse inhabitants of a &#8216;cultural field&#8217; constructed around the Indian movie in a specific Australian social context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/473</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling communication requirements in aged care using HL7 V3 methods</field><field name="creator">Frean, Isobel</field><field name="description">Australia and other western nations are actively formulating strategies that will increase the adoption of information and communication technology (ICT) amongst privatesector providers of aged care. The drivers for this technological change involve population ageing reforms, concerns about the quality and safety of healthcare, and global strategies encouraging governments to transform the way they do business. This research set out to examine these drivers and to inform development of a national aged care ICT strategy in Australia. The research questions prompted an examination of how national health information systems and e-health reforms in Australia and overseas address aged care, with a view to describing a hierarchical structure of standards for interoperability using the Health Level Seven (HL7) Reference Information Model (RIM).HL7 refers to the international organisation involved in developing and supporting healthcare standards.A review of the implementation of national health and technology reforms revealed there are gaps in most western nation&#8217;s approaches to e-health reform when it comes to identifying the information management and communication requirements of privatesector aged care providers. Through the participation of aged care provides in Australia, detailed requirements were gathered using a Delphi approach and analysed using healthcare information modelling methods to inform the development of a hierarchy of Australian aged care messaging and communication standards.The methodology chosen for  ocumenting these requirements was the HL7 Development Framework (HDF), the methodology which all HL7 Technical Committees are required to follow in the development of Version 3 (V3) standards. The first three of the seven formal phases to the HDF were employed to document a consensus business vision for  nteroperability in aged care and some 82 storyboards. This provided detailed understanding of the likely system-to-system interactions and the associated application roles and receiver responsibilities of some 121 discrete interactions. Ten of these storyboards were subjected to international review as part of the published requirements for the HL7 V3 Care Provision standard in 2005. This comprehensive set of requirements informed development of an aged care Domain Analysis Model (DAM) whose elements were mapped to the HL7 RIM. This enabled the development of some early examples of how the aged care domain might be modelled using RIM conformant design models and how these might in turn be represented in an aged care Domain Information Model (DIM).Modelling the requirements of aged care providers using the HDF revealed four areas of communication complexity: Accessing an aged care service; Contractual documentation associated with securing and funding an aged care service; Effective coordination of service delivery; and Consistent documentation of services delivered. A number of solutions for addressing these complexities are proposed including migration of the current aged care referral process to an electronic application process; adoption of a new aged care case-management structure by collaborating healthcare and aged care providers; and adoption of a suite of national forms-based specifications using the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) standard. These proposals offer possible solutions for achieving the interoperability vision described in this research and they are supported by the proposed aged care DIM. They will, however, rely upon the adoption of uniform messaging standards by aged care providers and by healthcare providers interfacing with them such as hospitals, General Practitioners and Aged Care Assessment Teams. To engender adoption of such standards, a role delineation model for implementation of the proposed hierarchy of aged care messaging standards is described. Together, these finding offer practical contributions towards the development of a national strategy for the adoption of ICT in aged care which is capable of supporting the objectives of population ageing and quality and safety reforms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/587</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation and distribution of real-time content</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Cong Duc</field><field name="description">The rapid increases in network bandwidth and processing power have led to tremendous growth in Internet applications and changed the nature of delivering content. From earlier web application, which is only about retrieval of pre-computed static content, current content delivery architectures provide dynamic content and enable personalization of content. Recent interactive entertainment applications, such as multiplayer online games, require content to be created and distributed in real-time. In addition, the rapid increase in processor speed has led to various proposals to put real-time computation within or at the edge of the network that allow application specific processing on packet flow such as multimedia transcoding and content adaptation. In short, these emerging applications have a common characteristics that the contents of application flows are processed in real-time before being delivered to end users. We refer to these as applications that require real-time content creation.This thesis aims to develop models for real-time content creation and distribution. We examine both network architectures for delivering content as well as server processing resource management for content creation. We concentrate on a case study when content creation is from a dynamic set of dispersed sources. In particular, we examine the provision of an immersive voice communication service to massively multiplayer online games, which requires real-time creation of audio scenes from dynamic sets of participants. We present various delivery architectures for this service, evaluate the performance of these architectures and provide recommendations based on the evaluation. In addition, this thesis designs a server resource management architecture for sharing processing resource among real-time content creation applications.Our study begins with reviewing the evolution of content distribution over the Internet, ranging from simple caching proxies to content distribution networks and personalization of content. We then discuss current and future developments of content distribution which require real-time creation and distribution of content from dynamic sets of dispersed sources. These include state information processing and communication information processing in distributed virtual environments. While all networked games require state information processing, communication information processing has been recently seen as a key to enhance the reality and attractiveness of the virtual environment. In particular, this thesis reviews technologies and approaches for providing an immersive voice communication service to distributed virtual environments. Several delivery architectures are introduced for providing this service, namely peer-to-peer, central server, distributed locale server architecture, and distributed proxy architecture. Furthermore, we present a realistic simulation model that captures player distribution in the Internet and avatar distribution in the game virtual world and specify two key performance evaluation parameters: interactive delay and network bandwidth usage.In the central server architecture, two optimization objectives are proposed for choosing an optimal central server from a set of potential servers. We also propose a dynamic relocation of a central server in response to changes in player distribution due to time zone differences. It is shown that relocation of the central server in response to these changes can significantly reduce the interactive delay by up to 40% and the network bandwidth usage by up to 50%. In addition, the optimal central server can significantly reduce the interactive delay compared to a randomly located central server. In the distributed locale server architecture, the game virtual world is partitioned into smaller areas called locales and each locale is assigned to a server. We propose two server assignment algorithms for optimizing the latency performance of this architecture. The first algorithm is based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model which provides an exact solution to the problem but is subject to high computation complexity. We then produce a new multi-layer graph representation of the problem and devise a greedy heuristic based on this graph. It is shown that the greedy heuristics has low run time complexity and provides solutions close to the optimal (within 5% of the optimal in all cases). In addition, increasing the number of servers reduces the latency of the distributed locale server architecture significantly compared to the optimal central server when there is a physical/virtual world correlation. Specifically, with a reasonable number of servers, the distributed locale server architecture can reduce the delay of the central server by 20% to 60%.In the distributed proxy architecture, players are assigned to a close proxy and each proxy manages the audio mixing operation on behalf of players and forwards audio streams from players to other interested proxies. This thesis develops an ILP model for an optimal proxy assignment and adapts the multi-layer graph approach used earlier to devise a greedy heuristics for solving the proxy assignment problem efficiently. While the ILP model is unscalable, the greedy heuristics is highly scalable and suitable for practical implementation. This thesis also investigates the efficiency of network multicast in different player and avatar distribution scenarios. The effect of varying the number of proxies is also investigated. Extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of all delivery architectures. In particular, since the distributed locale server architecture and the distributed proxy architecture are &#8216;dual&#8217; of each other, we concentrate on comparing the performance of these. From the performance evaluation, we provide recommendations on choosing suitable delivery architectures based on the server resource availability, multicast, and game&#8217;s avatar aggregation behaviors. The quantitative study in this thesis will be of benefit to future immersive voice service providers in the design of a cost effective delivery architecture for this service. Finally, the thesis presents a resource management architecture for sharing processing resources among various real-time content creation applications including the immersive audio mixing application. Due to the inability of determining processing times for scheduling, a processing resources scheduling algorithm called Start-time Weighted Fair Queueing (SWFQ) is proposed. From analysis and simulation, it is shown that SWFQ offers good fairness and delay properties compared to current schemes. In fact, the fairness of SWFQ was comparable to Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) and the delay behavior is better than Start-time Fair Queueing (SFQ).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/593</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing effective protected area networks - integration of the tropical cyclone disturbance regime in the Great Barrier Reef Representative Area Program : a GIS application</field><field name="creator">Debort, Sophie</field><field name="description">In recognition of the scenic, ecological, and scientific values of the marine environment, attempts at conservation are increasingly recognized. In a world progressively modified by human activities, the conservation of biodiversity is essential as insurance to maintain resilient ecosystems and ensure a sustainable flow of ecosystems goods and services to society. Unfamiliarity with large disturbances that rarely occur has resulted in the neglect of this kind of event in reserve management. Cyclones are extremely powerful events that can damage coastal and marine environments like coral reefs by generating large wave forces, sediment resuspension and subsequent smothering, influx of large volumes of freshwater and terrestrial sediment due to heavy rains, and winds and storm surge. For example, in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), a lack of knowledge about large natural disturbances like cyclones and their effect on the marine environment has prevented managers of the Marine Park from explicitly considering such perturbations in planning. The goal of this study was to place what is known about widespread natural disturbances (tropical cyclones) into the context of marine reserve design requirements and management decision for the conservation of the GBR, Australia. To do so, the newly implemented Representative Area Program (RAP) of the GBR Marine Park (GBRMP) was evaluated against the recently characterised tropical cyclone disturbance regime across the region (Puotinen, 2005a). Recruitment to reefs by settlement of distant larvae via a series of short steps within and between reefs is a key process towards reef recovery. It was then assumed that the reefs that are highly protected (HPR) from human activities should also be relatively cyclone-free, to allow them to act as &#8216;sources&#8217; of larvae to enable recovery of less protected adjacent reefs after disturbances. The level of cyclone disturbances at HPR was characterised based on its frequency and timing, and its influence on connectivity between HPR (source) and non-HPR (sink) reefs across the GBR. Even though most HPRs have had time to recover fully between tropical cyclone events at least once over the last 35 years, they typically had a short time to recover between subsequent cyclone events (short recovery periods). Thus, they may not always be available as &#8216;sources&#8217; of larvae in a given year, which reduces the effective connectivity between sources and sink reefs in that cyclone disturbance regime. Under such scenario, the RAP may not adequately protect the GBR. This is the case because HPR (potentially representing the best source for support and replenishment of adjacent areas) have not been placed to ensure infrequent exposure to cyclone damage. Because reserves are usually meant to be permanent, their design must be effective even under conditions that may be very different from current conditions. In this context, it is important to consider the history of disturbance in a region as it may determine the level of complexity or fragility that this region can develop between disturbance events. The RAP was developed with the best information available at the time, but the characterisation of the GBR cyclone disturbance regime now available (Poutinen, 2005a) suggests that the timing of the most recent cyclone event is not typical of the 1969-2003 time series. Thus, an &#8216;insurance&#8217; factor based on Allison et al. (2003) was complied to identify how much additional reef area would need to be set aside to allow for the creation of a new framework accommodating the reality of cyclone disturbance in marine reserve planning. Overall, only for short recovery times (5-10 years) and ecosystem level connectivity between source and sink reefs can a sufficient additional insurance reserve be realistically set aside to provide a buffer against cyclone disturbance. One solution to this may be to create temporary dynamic reserves as needed after severe cyclones. The effectiveness of such measures over the long-term will depend not only on the occurrence and magnitude of other disturbances that may develop synergistically to create more dramatic effects on reefs but also on global climate change. Predicting effects of directional climate change will facilitate the evaluation of the long-term success of a reserve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/630</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and ecology of diadromous fishes in south eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Miles, Nathan G</field><field name="description">Diadromous fishes are a frequent but poorly understood component of coastal riverine fish communities in Australia. Many of Australia&#8217;s coastal riverine fish, including diadromous species, have undergone declines in abundance and distribution since European settlement. Fish that were once plentiful are now generally rare or appear to be extinct in some catchments or parts of their range. However, as a group, diadromous fish species have complex lifecycles, the details of which have not been well investigated. The various environments and habitats used by diadromous fish are also under threat, through poor land practices, land reclamation and river regulation. The current study aimed to fulfil a number of gaps in the current knowledge of diadromous fishes in Australia. The primary objective was to examine the current distribution, abundance and biology of diadromous fish species of south eastern Australia.As information on diadromous fishes in Australia was limited, an extensive review of the literature has been conducted as a basis for identifying knowledge gaps. From this review, it was estimated that 33 Australian fish species display diadromous lifecycles, of which only seven have information available for most life stages (Lates calcarifer, Macquaria novemaculeata, Galaxias maculatus, G. brevipinnis, G. truttaceus, Geotria australis and Mordacia mordax). Diadromy in Australian fish species is dominated by amphidromy (45.5%) and catadromy (42.4%), with only a small proportion of the diadromous species anadromous (12.1%). The geographical distribution of diadromy in Australia showed that the highest species richness occurred in the north east and south east of the continent, with lowest species richness in the south west. Latitudinally, northern latitudes of Australia are dominated by amphidromy, the central latitudes by catadromy and the southern latitudes have relatively even numbers of all three diadromous types. The lack of information on diadromous fishes and the high level of environmental degradation and river regulation in south eastern Australia highlight the urgent need for further research on diadromous species in this region.Diadromous fishes use a range of marine and freshwater environments at different life history stages. As a result, a variety of fish sampling methods were trialled and their efficiency in catching a wide range of species and fish sizes in marine and freshwater environments was assessed. The examined methods included: seine net, scoop net, fyke net, plankton nets, light traps and fish traps. Each method proved useful for capturing certain fish species and fish sizes. Overall, the seine net caught the greatest number of individuals and species, and this method was also time efficient for catching and sorting the catch. As a result, seine nets were adopted for all of the larger scale studies that were conducted in the current research. The broadscale study (Chapter 4) conducted over a large spatial scale also incorporated scoop nets, bait traps and multi panel gill nets, as these provided a range of active and passive methods which allowed rapid assessment of fish at each site. The more detailed study (Chapter 5) aimed to examine a wide range of fish sizes and life stages over larger temporal scales, and used all the methods that were trialled in the pilot study, as the use of these methods ensured that the entire lifecycle of diadromous species could be sampled.The distribution and abundance patterns of diadromous and riverine fishes were investigated over large spatial scales, by sampling at 47 sites in 17 catchments between 2004 and 2005. A total of 13 269 fish from 31 species were recorded and these were dominated in number by native freshwater fishes (10 252 fish, 8 species), when compared with introduced freshwater fishes (1 570 fish, 3 species), marine fishes (777 fish, 10 species) and diadromous fishes (670 fish, 10 species). Although diadromous fish were only recorded in limited abundance, they were important in that they constituted: a large number of species to the assemblages; larger sized fish to the community; and, key species to reproductive, trophic and behavioural guilds. In particular, diadromous fish made up the majority of carnivorous species which feed on allochthonous inputs and they also contributed to herbivorous and omnivorous guilds. Multivariate analyses (MDS and ANOSIM) significantly delineated fish assemblages based on marine and coastal bioregions, river size, estuary type and river reach. SIMPER revealed that a range of freshwater, introduced, marine and diadromous fish contributed to these differences in the fish communities. Galaxias maculatus, Gobiomorphus australis, Potamalosa richmondia and M. novemaculeata were the diadromous species which most often contributed to these differences.The temporal and spatial variability of diadromous fish assemblages were examined in more detail in the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers. Differences in fish assemblages were influenced spatially by the longitudinal gradients throughout the catchment and by the migrational patterns and recruitment of diadromous fishes. Temporal variation in diadromous fish assemblages were also complicated by the lifecycle of diadromous fishes as many species have migrating larvae, juveniles and/ or adults which mean they can be present in the stream throughout all seasons but in different life stages. As a result, diadromous fish assemblages in the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers exhibited complex spatial and temporal patterns which reflected their lifecycles and migratory requirements. Longitudinal changes in diadromous fish assemblages in the Shoalhaven River were also influenced by the presence of Tallowa Dam. Fish communities below this structure were more similar to those further downstream, but diadromous fishes were also affected by cold water pollution below this structure. The abundance of diadromous fish were also negatively correlated with distance from the tidal limit, but were generally positively correlated with instream habitats such as woody debris and undercut bank.The migratory history of five species were examined through otolith microchemistry. In order to ensure that otolith Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca values in wild fish were the result of ambient salinities, a manipulative experiment was conducted. Fish were held in various salinities and temperatures for a period of up to 62 days. The resulting Sr:Ca values showed patterns which reflected that of the salinity regime. However, for some species the Ba:Ca values did not appear to reflect changes in salinity. Transects across otoliths from wild caught fish also revealed distinct variations in otolith Sr:Ca values, with patterns that indicated a diadromous lifecycle in freshwater mullet (Myxus petardi) and striped gudgeon (Gobiomorphus australis). Freshwater herring (Potamalosa richmondia), Cox&#8217;s gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii) and bullrout (Notesthes robusta) displayed less obvious patterns in Sr:Ca values, perhaps reflecting more complex patterns of movement between marine and freshwater environments. Although, some of these species were previously thought to be diadromous, the current study suggested that, for some species, the type of diadromy (or range of movements) may differ from those previously documented. The most important finding was the apparent amphidromous lifecycle of M. petardi, in at least for these populations from the Shoalhaven and Clyde Rivers.This research provided new information on the biology and status of a number of diadromous fish species of south eastern Australia. Of particular importance was the collection of new information about M. petardi and P. richmondia, including the capture of larvae and juveniles from brackish water. These data supported the diadromous lifecycles, which were indicated by otolith microchemistry. Age estimates confirmed longevity in P. richmondia (~10 years) and M. petardi (~5 years) and from the specimens of N. robusta that were examined it appears that they have longevity in excess of five years. This study also highlighted an apparent decline in distribution and abundance of Prototroctes maraena and Pseudaphritis urvillii on the NSW south coast, which may be a cause for concern. More research is required to determine the status and threats for these species, in particular.The current study has provided important new information about the distribution and abundance patterns, as well as the biology, for a number of diadromous species in this region. It has also highlighted the need for further research and management of this important group of fish.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/727</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What is the nature of the relationship between literacy based teacher professioinal learning and the classroom practices of five primary school teachers</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Barbra Kay</field><field name="description">This inquiry began as a SPIRT or APA(I) grant between the University of Wollongong and the Catholic Diocese of Broken Bay and reflected a common are of need namely an interest in the relationship between literacy based teacher professional learning and their resulting classroom practice. Or, how what teachers learn from their professional learning experiences is translated into their classroom practice. In order to understand this relationship a series of five case studies located within three schools from a Catholic school system were explored.Within Australia there have been calls for increased investments in the professional learning of teachers (McKenzie, 2002; Vinson, 2001; Ramsay, 2000) and more extensive understanding regarding the impact of professional learning on teachers beliefs (Rodgers, 2002). There class have been motivated in part by pressures linked to globalisation (Fullan, 2000; Darling-Hammond, 1996; Hargreaves, 1994; DEST, 2003; NITL 2005) and driven by the need for educators to produce students who realise the need for diverse, continuous and appropriate or life-long learning (Darling-Hammond, 2005; Fullan, 2000). Of interest to this inquiry is the notion that individual teacher change occurs within an organisational context (Weick, 1995; Vaughan, 1996; Mills, 2003; Coburn, 2001, 2004, 2005) fraught with powerful organisational and cultural factors that work to either enable or inhibit teacher change (Datnow, 2002; Fullan, 2000; Goodson, 2001).There is a paucity of literature reporting studies conducted at a classroom level that focus upon understanding how teachers transform professional learning experiences into their individual classroom environments. This study aims to address this research gap by working towards the development of a more robust theory of the change process involved in the transfer of literacy based professional learning experiences into classroom practice.This inquiry utilises a qualitative constructive methodology in a &#8216;bricolage&#8217; (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2000a: 4; Arminio &amp; Hultgren, 2002:456) that reflects the complex nature of classroom research and enables both a grounded theory methodology and case study methods to be utilised within this study. This choice acknowledges the importance of understanding the &#8216;multiple realities&#8217; of the respondents (Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1989:143) as well as the complex nature of the phenomena under study. The elements of Case Study and Grounded Theory, the way they are used in this inquiry, the unique setting and the interconnections between and among various methods of data collection and analysis serve to create the environment within which this inquiry is contained.The resultant grounded theory presents a theory that is grounded in or emerges from data (Dick, 2002; Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990). This is represented in diagrammatic form and demonstrates and discusses the type of change processes that teachers engage in. Implications and recommendations for a range of stakeholders are discussed in a number of related areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/847</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental health consumers' evaluation of recovery-oriented service provision</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Consumers have rarely been involved in the evaluation of recovery oriented service provision. This is somewhat surprising considering the increasing emphasis on recovery focused service delivery both in Australia and internationally (Australian Health Ministers, 2003; Slade, Amering, &amp; Oades, 2008).  This thesis addresses this gap by involving consumers in the evaluation, critique and ongoing improvement of the Collaborative Recovery Model received in case management settings across three eastern Australian states. The Collaborative Recovery Model has been used as a model to train mental health staff in evidence-based practices and constructs consistent with the recovery movement to assist them to effectively support the recovery process of people with chronic and recurring mental disorders. Key aspects of this model include two guiding principles &#8216;recovery as an individual process&#8217; and &#8216;collaboration and autonomy support&#8217; and four skills-based components 1) change enhancement; 2) collaborative needs identification; 3) collaborative goal striving and 4) collaborative task striving and monitoring (Oades et al., 2005). This thesis incorporates three key studies as part of the overall evaluation.  Study one (self-report questionnaire) sought to gain the broader perceptions of consumers&#8217; and case managers&#8217; regarding engagement in and perceived importance of recovery-focused practice received with staff trained in the Collaborative Recovery Model, when compared to consumers&#8217; and case managers&#8217; perceptions around receiving services as usual (non Collaborative Recovery Model trained staff). A questionnaire was developed and completed by 92 consumers and 97 case managers. Preliminary findings suggest that consumers working with Collaborative Recovery Model trained staff were able to identify significant changes to service delivery in relation to the frequency with which they were:  encouraged to take responsibility for recovery, collaborated with staff and completed homework activities to assist them to achieve their goals. In contrast to findings for consumers, case managers did not report that they engaged in activities consistent with the Collaborative Recovery Model more frequently when they had received training. The vast majority of consumers and case managers appeared to value, or place importance on key parts of the Collaborative Recovery Model.  Study two (semi structured interviews) sought to explore in detail consumers&#8217; perceptions regarding the Collaborative Recovery Model as received in case management settings and its use in relation to supporting their personal recovery journey. Twenty two consumers were purposively sampled. Findings provided insight into processes considered valuable by consumers. For example, with respect to goal striving and homework activities consumers discussed benefits in relation to providing a sense of direction for life, encouraging ownership and responsibility, benefits of formal documentation and positive feelings of achievement and personal growth, among others. Concerns were offered by some participants such as appropriateness of the terminology &#8216;homework&#8217; and some consumers preference for the term &#8216;life&#8217; over the term &#8216;recovery.&#8217; Other concerns reflected a deeper need for improved transfer of the Collaborative Recovery Model in practice within mental health services, as opposed to criticism of the conceptual model per se. Study three (focus group meetings) incorporated a reflexive design bringing together groups of consumers to discuss key findings from study one and two. The central aim was to generate further feedback to inform improvement of the Collaborative Recovery Model and its use and delivery in services. Eighteen consumers were purposively sampled. Findings offered further support for many earlier concerns and recommendations, for example concerns around terminology and transfer of training issues. Additional concerns and ideas were also raised including the inadequacy of orientation to the Collaborative Recovery Model, concerns around the existing format of goal and homework sheets and suggestions for redevelopment of sheets into a book format, owned and individualised by consumers. In summary, consumers were able to perceive some recovery-focused changes following staff training in the Collaborative Recovery Model. Consumers and case managers valued the key guiding principles and components of this model. However consumers wanted to be more empowered and involved in use of the model from the outset such as through an equivalent training/introductory session, a peer led group to introduce and share experiences of recovery and use of a hand held diary to record goal striving to be personalised and owned by consumers. Such directions around empowering consumers to take more responsibility for usage of the model and hence their own recovery may also hold promise for addressing difficulties regarding transfer of the Collaborative Recovery Model from theory into practice within mental health services.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/824</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the mystery of being</field><field name="creator">Reddan, Marion</field><field name="description">Martin Heidegger has been described as the philosopher of being. His work is a critique of the dualistic thinking of the metaphysical tradition, where being is regarded as a fundamental ground, and indubitable knowledge is prioritised over sensuous experience. Heidegger&#8217;s own view is that being is an absence of ground, and a dynamic process in which things emerge into presence from concealment. Whereas the tradition interprets being as a concept, Heidegger focuses on what he describes as &#8220;the experience of being.&#8221; His inquiry draws upon the medieval mystics&#8217; relationship to God, and the Presocratic philosophers&#8217; experience of wonder at the mystery of existence. In an attempt to understand being itself, Heidegger analyses the being of the human, &#8220;Dasein.&#8221; He argues that because we find ourselves thrown into the world and having to face the imminent possibility of death, we engage in a process of self-creation by projecting ourselves into possibilities. In his later work, Heidegger presents the idea that being and Dasein belong to each other, and can only be understood on the basis of an originary form of difference that is both a union and a separation.                    My theory is that the dualities structuring thought and language are a consequence of our existence as embodied, spatio-temporal beings, and that metaphysics is one of the ways in which that duality is expressed. I compare Heidegger&#8217;s notion of originary difference with the concepts of ch&#333;ra in Plato, and the apeiron in Anaximander. The two Greek philosophers describe a dynamic, non-dual state of potential from which everything that exists is generated and sustained. Such a state is reflected in the interpretations of mystical experience, where subjects in various traditions throughout history have reported a sense of oneness in the apparent dissolution of the temporal and the spatial. In contrast to Heidegger&#8217;s later view that mysticism is an expression of metaphysics, I propose that mystical experience is a pathway to the experience of being. {Contact author: vkaqm88d@netspace.net.au}</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/825</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions towards the development of the Technical Report IEC/TR 61000-3-13 on voltage unbalance emission allocation</field><field name="creator">Paranavithana, Prabodha</field><field name="description">Although voltage unbalance is a well understood concept, its presence as a power quality problem in electricity transmission and distribution networks has continued to be an issue of concerns primarily due to difficulties found by some network service providers in maintaining acceptable levels. This emphasises the lack of recommendations on engineering practices governing voltage unbalance that would facilitate the provision of adequate supply quality to connected customers.The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has recently released the Technical Report IEC/TR 61000-3-13 which provides guiding principles for coordinating voltage unbalance between various voltage levels of a power system through the allocation of emission limits to installations. Although the IEC report is based on widely accepted basic concepts and principles, it requires refinements and original developments in relation to some of the key aspects. This thesis primarily focuses on making contributions for further improvements to the IEC report so as to present a more comprehensive voltage unbalance allocation procedure.Similar to the counterpart IEC guidelines for harmonics (IEC 61000-3-6) and flicker (IEC 61000-3-7) allocation, IEC/TR 61000-3-13 also apportions the global emission allowance to an installation in proportion to the ratio between the agreed apparent power, and the total available apparent power of the system seen at the busbar where it is connected. However, noting that voltage unbalance at a busbar can arise as a result of both load and system (essentially lines) asymmetries, IEC/TR 61000-3-13 applies an additional factor which is referred to as &#8216;Kue&#8217; to the apportioned allowance. This factor Kue represents the fraction of the global emission allowance that can be allocated to customers, whereas the factor K0ue (= 1 &#8722; Kue) accounts for voltage unbalance which arises as a result of line asymmetries. Although IEC/TR 61000-3-13 recommends system operators to assess the factors Kue and K0ue for prevailing system conditions, a systematic method for its evaluation is not provided other than a rudimentary direction. This thesis initially examines, employing radial systems, the influence of line asymmetries on the global emission levels in medium voltage (MV) and high voltage (HV) power systems in the presence of various load types/bases including three-phase induction motors. It is shown that the factor K0ue is seen to be dependant not only on line parameters as evident from IEC/TR 61000-3-13, but also on the downstream load composition. In essence, the global emission levels in HV power systems is seen to arise as a result of both the local HV lines and the downstream MV lines in the presence of considerable proportions of induction motor loads. Eventually, generalised methodologies, covering both radial and interconnected networks, for the assessment of the global emission in MV and HV power systems which arises due to line asymmetries are proposed.In allocating voltage unbalance based on the IEC/TR 61000-3-13 recommendations, quantitative measures of its propagation from higher voltage to lower voltage levels in terms of transfer coefficients, and from one busbar to other neighbouring busbar of a sub-system in terms of influence coefficients are required. IEC/TR 61000-3-13 gives a method for evaluating the MV to LV transfer coefficient suggesting a value less than unity for industrial load bases containing large proportions of mains connected three-phase induction motors, and a value of unity for passive loads in general. Upon detailed examination, it is noted that a transfer coefficient &gt; 1 can arise in the presence of commonly prevailing constant power loads. Incorporating these different influences exhibited by various load types under unbalanced supply conditions on the propagation, comprehensive methods for assessing the MV to LV and HV to MV transfer coefficients are proposed. A systematic approach for estimating influence coefficients for interconnected network environments taking their dependency on the downstream load composition into account is developed.The IEC allocation policy with regard to harmonics and flicker has been found not to guarantee that the emission limits allocated to customers ensure non-exceedance of the set planning levels. This thesis reports that the above is an issue with voltage unbalance as well. Overcoming this problem, an alternative allocation technique referred to as &#8216;constraint bus voltage&#8217; (CBV) method which closely aligns with the IEC approach has been suggested for harmonics and flicker. The work presented in this thesis extends the suggested CBV method to voltage unbalance allocation adding appropriate revisions to address the additional aspect of the emission which arises as a result of line asymmetries.In the application of the IEC/TR 61000-3-13 principles to better manage existing networks already experiencing excessive voltage unbalance levels, the initial development of insights into the influences made by various sources of unbalance is required. Employing an existing 66kV interconnected sub-transmission system as the study case, deterministic studies are carried out in a systematic manner considering each of the asymmetrical elements. Approaches for studying the voltage unbalance behaviour exhibited by various sources which exist in interconnected network environments are established. These are employed to identify the most favourable line transposition options for the study system. Further, this knowledge that facilitates the identification of contributions made by individual unbalanced sources forms a platform for developing techniques to assess the compliance with emission limits, which is another subject of relevance to future editions of IEC/TR 61000-3-13.As an essential tool for carrying out the studies, an unbalanced load flow program based on the phase coordinate reference frame incorporating the component level load flow constraints and the three-phase modelling of system components is developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/834</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Floating between the Orient and the Occident: Japan, Australia and their inferiority complex</field><field name="creator">Harada, Yoko</field><field name="description">Japan and Australia are generally understood as very different countries in terms of culture, history and ethnicity.  However, if we focus on their formation as modern nation states they are contemporaries and their similarities become visible.  Under the influence of European and American imperial/colonial expansion, they both became modern nation states around the turn of the last century.  As a result of being latecomers to the Western dominated international community they both developed an &#8220;inferiority complex&#8221; in relation to the West.  This made them appear ambiguous within in the context of Asia where they geographically belong.  Their ambiguous national identities are aptly represented in the reading of Edward W. Said by Japanese and Australian intellectuals.  In a world which Said described being dichotomous and hierarchical, they float between the Orient and the Occident.  Their ambiguous identities troubled by an inferiority complex are well reflected in their behaviour in the international arena.  On the one hand, as frontrunners in the region in terms of modernity, they act in a superior manner towards neighbouring Asian countries.  On the other hand, they tend to be connected to strong countries in the West.  Japan and Australia&#8217;s closeness in recent years can be explained as an outcome of their similarly ambiguous position in the world.  They are still captured by the rhetoric of colonialism and imperialism and in this sense they have not yet been fully &#8220;decolonised&#8221;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3034</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christian communication and its impact on Korean society : past, present and future</field><field name="creator">Lee, Soon Nim</field><field name="description">Background: Although it is historically acknowledged that the Republic of Korea (South) has become a modern democratic republic, very little has been written or researched about the processes that were involved in achieving this state and the role of Christian Communication in national development.  Traditionally, for many centuries, Korea was a feudal kingdom, known as the &#8216;Hermit Kingdom&#8217;.  How then, did the country move in a short space of time from this kingdom to the republic of today?  What were the most influential factors?Aims: The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate that Christian Communication has been, and continues to be a major influence in the social and national development of modern Korea.Methods and procedures: First, to research the development of Christian Communication in the nation since the time of the last kingdom to the present time, an examination of historical documents and records were conducted.  Secondly, the lives of national leaders were examined and national identities were interviewed for their assessments of the impact of Christian Communication on the character of the nation.  Thirdly, the thesis explains the ongoing development of modern methods of Christian Communication and the continuous impact that they have on the nation.Outcome and results: Looking at the overall period from the 19th century to 2008, it is clear that Christian Communication has been one of the most important factors in the development of the character and society of South Korea. The initial decision of the early missionaries in the 1880s to use the old, common, but neglected Hanguel language was probably the most important decision in the life of any nation in the last 150 years.  Without the widespread use of this language and the consequent publishing of books and newspapers, Korea would still have been locked in the restrictive use of a Chinese script and traditional governmental methods. The general population would have been denied the possibility of national communication across all levels of society.  The people of Korea would not have been equipped to survive as a culture, under the Japanese occupation and, later, the catastrophic Korean War.Conclusion: Christian Communication, especially publishing in all its forms, has had a major impact on the character of the democratic life of the nation as seen in the rediscovery of Hanguel, as the modern language of communication and the development of various communications media pioneered by the early Christian leaders within Korea.This impact continues today through the use of the electronic as well as the more traditional methods of publishing.Without the dynamic Christian Communication in its many forms, Korea would not be the nation that it is today.  Its prosperity and its educational and social institutions would not have developed as rapidly and dramatically as it can be seen in most areas of national life.

The thesis work has mainly concentrated on chitosan as the gel actuator material. Chitosan is a widely used biopolymer that shows a large volume transition through changing pH.	The pH induced actuation behaviour of polymer gels makes these materials analogous to a biological muscle. From a mechanics viewpoint, polymers gels are very compliant, unlike more common engineering material such as metals or ceramics or even most polymers. 		The mechanical work output of an actuation system is determined from a combination of the displacement and force generated. A complication arises with gel actuators since prior work has shown that the application of an external force can change the gel volume transition. Very little information is available regarding the specific effect of an external load on the displacement generated by a gel actuator. 		The thesis included experiments on a homogeneous solvent swollen rubber as a model system. Actuation of the rubber was effected through solvent exchange.	The mechanical actuation was investigated by three different approaches: Linear Elastic, Thermodynamic and Linear Elastic generalized to 3D (finite element model). These models are to account for both the mechanical properties and the actuation behaviour of these materials. Uniaxial mechanical testing has been conducted on natural rubber and chitosan gel in both the fully expanded and fully contracted states, and the material parameters from these mechanical tests were used in the various models. The model and material parameters are then used to predict the rubber/chitosan actuation behaviour under isotonic loading. 	Actuation tests on chitosan fibres showed unexpected results. Chitosan fibres showed a considerable strain difference between length and diameter during free actuation. An applied load during actuation process gave completely unexpected results: contraction in the length direction when expansion was expected and vice versa. The 3 - dimensional elastic approach based on the Finite Element Model was modified from the isotropic material (natural rubber) to account for the anisotropic chitosan fibres. This model enables a reasonable estimate of the Young&#8217;s modulus and Poisson&#8217;s ratio. The results suggest that the materials have different Young&#8217;s modulus in the longitudinal and transversal directions which produces a high expansion in the transversal direction in comparison with the longitudinal, affecting directly the actuation process.Moreover the changes in Poisson&#8217;s ratio and modulus due to a change in the chemical environment (pH or solvent) were also shown to account for the unexpected actuation results.	Useful dynamic information on the molecular scale was obtained on the structure of the fibre using a real-time small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique. Parameters (particularly correlation lengths and intensity) fitted to the experimental data clearly indicated structural differences in the directions perpendicular and parallel to the fibre axis, however detailed description of the molecular organisation requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3069</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the biomass, diversity and nutrient relationships of macroalgae and seagrasses in Lake Illawarra, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Rutten, Karin</field><field name="description">Lake Illawarra is a shallow barrier lagoon, located on the south-eastern coast of Australia. Eutrophication, referring to the enrichment of water by inorganic plant nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus), is one of the key environmental problems in Lake Illawarra. Management of macroalgae in Lake Illawarra is a major issue; excessive blooms of macroalgae, resulting in odours, access problems and community concern over Lake health, have led to many management strategies, including direct harvesting of algal biomass. Little information is available on the factors responsible for excessive growth of macroalgae in Lake Illawarra, although over supply of nutrients has often been cited as the primary cause. The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution, diversity, biomass and nutrient relationships of seagrasses and macroalgae in Lake Illawarra, and to determine what contribution, if any, macrophytes make to the Lake&#8217;s nutrient budget.  Firstly, detailed species lists and taxonomic descriptions were prepared for macrophytes occurring in Lake Illawarra, between June 2000 and July 2003. This study focused primarily on shallow (&lt; 1 m depth), inshore areas of Lake Illawarra, where problematic macroalgal blooms frequently occur. Seagrasses found in Lake Illawarra are Zostera capricorni, Ruppia megacarpa, Halophila ovalis and Halophila decipiens. In addition, 35 species of macroalgae were recorded and described; these included: 14 species from 7 genera of green macroalgae; 9 species from 9 different genera of brown macroalgae; and, 8 species from 8 genera of red macroalgae.  The biomass of seagrasses and macroalgae in Lake Illawarra were documented seasonally (winter and summer) at four key Lake Illawarra sites; these included two R. megacarpa sites and two Z. capricorni sites. Average R. megacarpa and Z. capricorni dry weight (DW) biomasses (above and below-ground material) ranged from 54.8 - 440 g DW m 2 and 58.1 - 230 g DW m 2, respectively. Significant die-back, particularly of Z. capricorni, occurred in winter; summer biomasses were up to 1.5 - 3.9 times higher than winter biomasses. Below-ground material (roots and rhizomes) comprised 20 - 45 % and 40 - 67 % of total plant biomass for R. megacarpa and Z. capricorni, respectively. Macroalgal biomass in 2000-03 was notably lower than in previous decades; this may be due to drought, as well as improvements in water quality. Maximum biomasses of macroalgae recorded in the present study were 150 - 370 g DW m 2. Algal blooms were composed primarily of the filamentous chlorophytes, Chaetomorpha linum and Chaetomorpha billardierii. The highest seagrass (R. megacarpa) and macroalgal biomasses usually occurred at the Oasis Caravan Park site, located along the eastern Lake Illawarra peninsula.  Tissue nutrient analyses were conducted on the most abundant seagrasses (Z. capricorni and R. megacarpa) and macroalgae occurring at four sites in Lake Illawarra, between spring 2000 and winter 2002. Total C contents of macrophytes varied from 23.3 - 42.0 % C for seagrasses, and 28.0 - 39.7 % C for macroalgae. The &#948;13C and &#948;15N contents of seagrasses ranged from -7.7 to  15.9 &#8240; and 0.7 - 9.0 &#8240;, respectively. The most significant seasonal variations in seagrass &#948;13C contents and, to a lesser extent&#61472;&#948;15N contents, occurred in Z. capricorni located at the source of fresh water input, Mullet Creek. Macroalgae showed a greater variation in isotopic signatures than the seagrasses, ranging from  4.9 to  19.8 &#8240; (&#948;13C) and 1.8 - 14.6 &#8240; (&#948;15N). Differences between species at the same site were often more significant than differences between the same species at different sites. Seagrass leaf N and P contents ranged from 1.74 - 4.13 % (mean &#177; s.e.: 2.62 &#177; 0.05 % N) and 0.12 - 0.59 % P (mean &#177; s.e.: 0.31 &#177; 0.01 % P); leaf N and P contents were typically double those of roots/rhizomes. N contents varied between species and sites, but P contents of Z. capricorni were usually significantly higher than R. megacarpa. Z. capricorni C and N contents increased in winter, corresponding to lower winter biomasses. Seagrass leaf biomass and tissue P contents peaked in summer 2002, which may be related to higher water column P concentrations in summer. Tissue N and P contents of macroalgae were more variable than those of the seagrasses, and ranged from 0.85 - 3.95 % N and 0.03 - 0.58 % P. The average C/P (808 &#177; 65) and N/P (47.9 &#177; 3.47) molar ratios of macroalgae were typically double those of the seagrasses. Low concentrations of tissue P, with respect to N, in R. megacarpa and macroalgae implied P limitation on several occasions, particularly when macrophyte biomasses were low. High tissue N contents in Lake Illawarra macrophytes suggested N limitation of biomass formation rarely occurred. Evidence of P, rather than N, limitation in macrophytes is surprising considering most data suggests N limitation of phytoplankton production in Lake Illawarra. The estimated pools of N and P contained in Lake Illawarra macrophyte biomass were similar to those present in the water column, but appeared minute when compared to the N and P stored within Lake Illawarra sediment.  Laboratory culture experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of the most problematic alga, Chaetomorpha linum, to nutrient enrichment. Water temperatures of 20 - 25&#176;C were found to promote the highest growth rates (up to 27 % WW d 1) of C. linum, but high growth rates (13 % WW d 1) were also recorded at 10&#176;C, the lowest winter water temperature recorded in Lake Illawarra. Enrichment with N, rather than P, had the greatest effect on C. linum; growth rates were significantly reduced in treatments without added N, but treatments with N-alone were statistically similar to N+P treatments. It was concluded that in Lake Illawarra, C. linum was strongly nitrogen limited. The ability of C. linum to grow successfully in culture, under a range of nutrient treatments, and without added phosphorus, in particular, correlates with the excessive growth of this alga in Lake Illawarra.  This study has made a significant contribution to the understanding of seagrass and macroalgal growth, biomass and distribution in Lake Illawarra. This information will assist with the long-term management of macroalgal problems in Lake Illawarra.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/22</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protecting private data in information systems</field><field name="creator">Kong, Yibing</field><field name="description">The use of private data is ubiquitous. On one hand, people submit their private data to obtain services. On the other hand, organizations need private data to carry out their business. Characterized by convenience, efficiency and cost-saving, information systems are useful for private data management. As a result, vast amounts of private data are collected and processed electronically. However, inadequate protection may end up with the abuse of private data. Privacy concerns affect people&#8217;s attitude towards providing their private data, which restricts the success of organizations&#8217; business. The importance of privacy control is well recognized today. Privacy control should be regarded as an imperative design criterion for information systems [40].The common ground between privacy and security allows us to develop privacy protection techniques based on existing security protection techniques. In the past decade, a few studies have been conducted in this area. Nevertheless, they give individuals limited control over their private data. In particular, after an individual submits his/her private data to an organization, he/she almost loses control over it. This thesis considers this lack of control as a potential problem in information systems. Based on existing security protection techniques, three privacy protection approaches are proposed: an access control based approach, a hierarchical encryption based approach and a digital ticket based approach. These approaches are highlighted for their consideration for information donors&#8217; privacy preferences.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/734</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of education theory to guide the implementation of participatory rural appraisal in the Kingdom of Tonga</field><field name="creator">Vea'ila, Tevita Taukei</field><field name="description">Agriculture is the mainstay of Tonga&#8217;s economy. It provides approximately 80% of employment opportunities and about 32% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The fragile environment and limited resources of Tonga such as small landmass, isolation, proneness to natural hazards, long distances and expensive transportation costs from overseas markets of Australasia, United States, Europe and Asia, create fiscal deficits, high inflation and vulnerable economic growth (Briguglio, 1995; Government of Australia, 1992).Before 1960, subsistence farming i.e. growing crops mainly for home consumption and festivities was the mode of production in Tonga. During the early 1970&#8217;s, local farmers started to apply agrochemicals and fertilisers as the substitution for traditional farming practices such as shifting cultivation, moon planting guides, seed saving and composting when trading with developed countries. Currently, many Tongan people rely on agriculture as their main source of livelihood but the high use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides to gain better yields is a short-term fix that has the potential to do serious damage to the health of the people of Tonga and their fragile environment.The theoretical framework for the research was participatory action research (Lewin, 1946). Participatory Action Research (PAR) is an alternative philosophy of social research and often associated with social transformation in the Third World. It is based on &#8220;liberation theology&#8221; and neo-Marxist approaches to community development in Latin America (Freire, 1968). Three particular attributes are often used to distinguish PAR from conventional research. These are shared ownership of research projects, community-based analysis of social problems and an orientation toward community action. This study was designed to appraise the usefulness of an appropriate educational theory to guide and support a research project that had as its attributes shared ownership, community based analysis of the problems and an orientation toward community action. The methodology framework for practical implementation of the project was participatory rural appraisal (PRA), a framework commonly used in agriculture development programs in less developed countries.The study had three main purposes: 1. To assess the strengths and limitations of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) as a framework for organising community education practices designed to improve ecologically sustainable methods of crop pest control in Tonga. 2. To identify an educational theory that would be suitable to support the PRA framework and that also addresses the reported limitations of PRA. 3. To use the perspective of a participatory action research framework (PAR) to evaluate the implementation of this theoretical educational model in the context of a two Tongan community groups who were the focus of the data collection. These were a group of women from a town and a group of young farmers from another village.The literature review suggested that Cambourne&#8217;s (1988) conditions of learning would be a suitable educational theory to support the PRA process and to address the limitations with PRA. The study then examined how Cambourne&#8217;s (1988) conditions of learning could be activated to support adult learning in the context of Tonga &#8211; in particular the following attributes of participatory action research: shared ownership of research projects, community-based analysis of social problems and an orientation toward community action.A qualitative research methodology was adopted to help understand the richness of the cultural context of the participants (groups of women and young men in villages in Tonga) and to understand how the various conditions of learning, as recommended by the educational theory, were activated during the implementation of the education program. The focus was on the education activities as recorded by the researcher and extensive use was made of field notes, interviews and photographs, as well as other artefacts. These data were used to maintain a consistent record of the changes and interventions that occurred during the learning activities.The findings showed that the Cambourne&#8217;s model could be adapted to effectively guide an adult education program in the context of Tonga and concluded that such a model has the potential to be used for similar education programs in other rural education contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/833</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sulfur dioxide in the Wollongong/Port Kembla area: a historical review of ambient atmospheric levels, major emission sources and their regulation</field><field name="creator">Bloem, Peter</field><field name="description">Air pollution from sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the Wollongong/Port Kembla region, New South Wales, Australia, has been of major concern for nearly 100 years. This longterm situation is due to the presence of local major industries which emit the gas, in particular, a copper smelter at Port Kembla, established in 1907. Extensive information on the emission and control of sulfur dioxide from this smelter has been reported over the years by the community, government and industry. Systematic monitoring of ambient atmospheric levels of sulfur dioxide was first undertaken in the region between 1957 and 1961. It recommenced in 1970 and has continued to the present day. This study is the first comprehensive, spatio-temporal analysis of all available ambient atmospheric sulfur dioxide monitoring data for the region. Previous reviews have tended to average data for the whole region, without considering the trends in specific locations and did not explore in any detail the relative contributions of major emission sources, such as the smelter. Two key factors were suspected to influence atmospheric sulfur dioxide levels in the region. The first was the nature of primary metallurgical operations undertaken at the smelter known to generate sulfur dioxide and any associated pollution abatement measures. The second was NSW government regulation regarding pollution control at the smelter. The interplay of these factors and their effect on ambient sulfur dioxide levels was explored over four distinct time periods namely; 1908 to 1965, 1966 to 1988, 1989 to 1995 and 1996 to 2006. The study found the copper smelter at Port Kembla has been a dominant source of elevated sulfur dioxide concentrations recorded in the area. There has been an overall decline in the atmospheric levels of sulfur dioxide from 1957 to the present day. The most significant downward trends in these sulfur dioxide concentrations were strongly associated with reductions in the load of sulfur dioxide emitted from the smelter. These were closely linked to changes in smelting technology (progression from batch &#8211; type to more continuous operation) and increasing pollution abatement (increasing sulfur capture) at the facility. The most significant of these reductions have tended to coincide with government intervention and regulation. This study provides a valuable retrospective on trends in air quality in the region and the environmental history of technology and regulation at the smelter in addressing ambient sulfur dioxide levels which, to date, have been poorly recorded.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2561</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational change and accounting information systems: a case study of the privatisation of Jordan Telecom</field><field name="creator">Shanikat, Mohammed</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an attempt to better understand organisational change and its impact on accounting information systems in privatised enterprises using the particular case study of Jordan Telecom (JT), which became subject to the liberalisation of the telecommunication industry. JT would not survive in its public sector form and the privatisation of JT remains very controversial. This study aims to understand the role of the Jordanian State in stimulating the external environment of JT in order to prepare for privatisation, to understand how the internal environment responded to change in the external environment, to understand how the accounting system shaped the pathway of the organisation development, to understand the perceived changes in the accounting information system that was influenced by the privatisation of JT. The literatures of theoretical foundations of the study include the role of the state in reforming the public sector as a basic milestone necessary for preparation of privatisation, and the organisational change and in particular the accounting system changes as a result of the adaptation of privatisation. The thesis uses a case study approach. The data collection consisted of two techniques: an intensive field study of the organisation subject to the investigation in order to explore and explain the privatisation phenomenon. Data collection involved two sources; interviews and documents. The participants that were selected depended on the recommendation of the coordinator from inside the organisation, who was appointed to help the researcher. A combination of theoretical perspectives is adopted to understand organisational change and the accounting information system role. These perspectives are; Institutional Theory, Resource Dependency Theory and Laughlin&#8217;s (1991) Organisational Change Model. The theoretical integration built provides a holistic approach to offer an alternative explanation to social phenomena. A framework was developed which demonstrates the suitability of the theoretical integration for analysing the role of the state and organisational changes during the three distinct eras in relation to the telecommunication industry, which is identified through the historical context of JT. These three eras are pre privatisation, transformation and post privatisation. They provide a foundation for the empirical analysis, which explains the role of external stimuli in disturbing the external environment of organisation. The organisation&#8217;s internal elements are shown to respond to the environmental disturbance and in particular the distinct change in the role of accounting systems. This study adds a significant contribution in studying privatisation from the context of Jordan, a developing country and a Kingdom. The study has findings at two levels.  First the level of the role of the government and JT&#8217;s alliance with the external party France Telecom, for the provision of resources, is reflecting the unique intersection of external stimuli and JT. The study has addressed some of the ways in which an accounting information system has been instrumental in the process of organisational change in the telecommunication industry in Jordan. It demonstrates that without a basic change in the interpretative schemes from a &#8216;technical vision&#8217; to a &#8216;business vision&#8217;, privatisation cannot achieve its objectives. It also provides a significant demonstration that the accounting information system acts as an interpretative scheme between the regulator (TRC) and regulated (JT). Second level, the framework developed here can be practically applied in other studies investigating organisational change. Multi layers of analysis can help inform policy such as mission level, resource level, organisation&#8217;s structure, design and role of the accounting information system, the flexibility to change, the use of new technology and the use of high level of training.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/103</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of employee participation in the private sector: Malaysian case studies</field><field name="creator">Parasuraman, Balakrishnan</field><field name="description">Employee participation refers to a wide variety of policies, mechanisms, and practices that enable employees to take part in decision-making, frequently at the level of the enterprise or workplace. The subject of employee participation (EP) in the organisation has attracted a great deal of international interest as attested by the considerable amount of research in the issue. However, whereas the issues have been fairly well researched in OECD countries, especially those in Europe, EP has been rather less emphasised in Asia. The few studies that have been conducted on EP in this Malaysia have been from the organisational behaviour perspective with a narrow set of variables under consideration. The present study makes significant contributions across all areas of EP for scholarly researchers as well as practitioners and policy-makers in Malaysia. The primary objective of this study has been to provide an insight in to why private companies (Steelco, Autoco and Posco) in Malaysia have developed direct and indirect forms, and what have been the major determinants and influences on the choice of forms of EP. The next objective of the study is to understand whether or not unions and non-managerial employees have any capacity to influence management final decision-making process at the firm level. To achieve these research objectives, a qualitative case research strategy was selected, which was appropriate given the paucity of information on EP in the Malaysian private sector. An extensive empirical research was undertaken through interviews with national union leaders, employers, managers, union representatives, and non-managerial employees. In addition to the interview technique, direct participation, memos, and reflective journal data were also utilised in this study. The results of the interview, direct observation, memos and reflective journal were triangulated for validity of study. These methods were also discussed in terms of their academic contributions to understanding why EP was implemented at company and workplace level, and concomitantly to study the capacity of the unions and non-managerial employees to influence management final decisions.The findings form the case study research of Steelco, Autoco and Posco found new factors, only rarely discussed in the international EP literature, to be important. These included mergers and acquisitions, privatisation policy, Malaysia&#8217;s Look East Policy, cross-cultural management styles and the influence of British colonial system. Other major research findings are related to the second objective of this study. The research results from studying Steelco, Autoco and Posco demonstrated that unions and nonmanagerial employees have very limited capacity to influence the management final decisions at company level. This is due to the Industrial Relations Act (managerial prerogative clause) 1967, the management attitudes towards union and workers, cultural orientation and values among Malaysia employees, and ineffectiveness of the Code of Conduct for Industrial Harmony 1975. The findings of present research have some implication for analytical models of EP, particularly the Favourable Conjunctures Model. As a consequence, a new model of EP which incorporates these findings from the Malaysian private sector is proposed in this research. The study concludes that this research not only contributes to the academic literature on EP but it should be of value of practitioners in industrial relations and human resource management, unions, the government agencies (Ministry of Human Resources Malaysia). In future research, similar studies can be applied more widely in Malaysia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/20</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstracting from the landscape: a sense of place</field><field name="creator">Gray, Sarah Willard</field><field name="description">In this study I will examine the following question: how is my painting informed by a layered sense of place through a political engagement with the environment?     During this research consideration was given to the origins, techniques and structures of my creative work that was underpinned by the artistic theories and processes I used while painting the landscape of the Hoskins Nature Reserve and the Bong Bong Common. These areas are situated midway between Bowral and Moss Vale on the Southern Highlands of New South Wales and are approximately 120 kms from the first penal colony established at Port Jackson in 1788.

It presents a study of how the party &#8220;reinvented&#8221; itself as a &#8220;New Labor&#8221; Party during this time, how this process occurred and who was most responsible for this fundamental change in the Party&#8217;s philosophy. As a necessary precursor to examining these two central themes, an analysis was undertaken of the foundations and philosophy of social democratic parties. In particular, the unique type of social democratic party that evolved in Australia, based on the notion of Labourism, is outlined. Through this examination, an appreciation emerges of the philosophical underpinnings, historical evolution and policies of the Australian Labor Party from its creation. Any study of Australia&#8217;s economic history must consider the relationship between banking and the Australian Labor Party. Accordingly, the evolution of Australia&#8217;s financial system, and how Labor&#8217;s policies and platforms for decades reflected outright antagonism towards banks, is presented. Issues such as the Money Power, creation of the Commonwealth Bank, bank nationalisation and financial deregulation all provide a background to Labor&#8217;s modernising agenda in the 1980s and 1990s. The thesis uses financial deregulation to examine how and why Labor embraced nontraditional, market-oriented economic policies during the Hawke/Keating Governments. It considers three case studies of financial deregulation in detail: the float of the dollar, the entry of foreign banks, and the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. In doing so, this analysis concludes that financial deregulation became part of a wider process of modernising the Australian Labor Party. Each of the case studies examines the roles of various actors along this modernisation path to elicit an understanding of the magnitude of the changes to the Party&#8217;s economic policy. The roles of Cabinet, Caucus, National Cnference, National Executive and the factions presents a unique insight into a Party embracing fundamental change. Using the writer&#8217;s inside knowledge as a member of the Hawke/Keating Governments, and drawing on the recollections of past and present Parliamentary colleagues, bankers, Party officials and advisers, the study concludes that Labor&#8217;s embrace of deregulatory economic policies did create a &#8220;new-style&#8221; Labor Party. Most credit for this philosophical leap of faith is given to Paul Keating, whose intellectual drive and sheer persistence saw Labor become a modern, outward-looking and relevant political party. The study has taken many secondary accounts of the ways in which policies were developed under the Hawke and Keating Governments and subjected them to rigorous analysis. The writer&#8217;s position as a participant in the government, as an author of elements of financial deregulation policies, and as a person with access to many of the major actors, ensures that the study makes a unique contribution to the understanding of policy development processes in the Labor Governments of the 1980s and 1990s.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/319</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keeping one step ahead: tandem, an assessment and intervention programme for parents of adolescents at risk of problem behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Stoyles, Gerard J</field><field name="description">This research emerged from a recognised need arising from other research literature as well as clinical practice to identify and intervene with adolescent problem behaviour at its earliest stages. Working with parents as co-facilitators with the clinician was acknowledged as being the primary means of motivating and supporting adolescents to alter behavioural patterns that if left unattended would most likely lead to complications of a legal and self-harming nature. The importance of looking to parents as the main focus of intervention recognised both the major influence of parents in the life of the adolescent and the underlying prerequisite of a warm, supportive, and hence protective family environment to promote adaptive adolescent development. These essential aspects gave rise to the TANDEM programme, with &#8220;The Family Check-Up&#8221; (Dishion, Kavanagh &amp; Kiesner, 1999) providing the developmental model. As the focus of this research, this programme aimed to ameliorate dysfunctional adolescent behaviour through clear identification of harmful risk-behaviour, the involvement of the parent in this assessment process, and the supportive development of appropriate skills and self-attributes within the parent as a means of reducing problem adolescent behaviour and an improved parent-adolescent relationship. The principal theoretical orientation of this research was cognitive-behavioural. At the outset, an assessment instrument was developed to identify harmful adolescent risk-behaviour. This development also served to identify domains that reflected normal adolescent risk-behaviour. The development of the assessment instrument commenced with a preliminary investigation of adolescent behavioural patterns. Data for the preliminary investigation was obtained from a metropolitan sample of male and female adolescent high school students (n = 187) ranging in age from 12 to 17 years (M = 14.53 years, SD = 0.50 years). A factor analysis of this data suggested the ongoing development of this assessment instrument. Findings from the preliminary investigation led to the initial instrument being restructured prior to its further administration. A parent version was also developed for this second research phase. The final shape of the assessment instrument included a revised format of the original questionnaire used in the preliminary investigation, together with the inclusion of additional questionnaires. These additional questionnaires investigated the adolescent&#8217;s use of alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, and the adolescent&#8217;s self-perception of future harmful risk. A questionnaire investigating parental resilience was included in the parent version only. The final format of both versions of the instrument was entitled the Adolescent Problem Behaviour Assessment (APBA). The APBA was administered to a metropolitan high school sample of adolescents (n = 410), ranging in age from 12 years to 16 years 9 months (M = 14.32 years, SD = 1.31 years). Two hundred and one students were male and 209 students were female. Apart from 14 males, the APBA was also administered to the parents of these students. Four hundred and eighty five parents responded (60.9% of the total parent sample), including 282 mothers and 203 fathers. Apart from responses to alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use, factor analyses were conducted in order to identify principal factors within each questionnaire of the APBA. Of particular note was the emergence of three factors that identified proneness towards problem behaviour in adolescence. These factors were entitled Peer Modelling, Parent/Family relationships, and Parental Monitoring/Limit Setting, and resembled the three factors describing adolescent behaviour resulting from the factor analysis of data from the preliminary investigation. A discriminant function analysis (DFA) was also conducted with adolescent data to determine the capacity of the APBA to classify adolescents&#8217; behaviour along a continuum of risk. Due to inconsistencies in parent data, the final parent version of the APBA was configured from the adolescent version. The implementation of the TANDEM programme for this research followed the development of the APBA. The running of this programme followed a linear process of adolescent risk assessment, feedback and discussion of assessment results, and the offer of a place in the six-week parenting course as a means of intervention. Parents were centrally involved at every point of this process. The APBA provided the principal means of risk assessment. Three further questionnaires were included with the parent version of the APBA as measures of parenting skill, perceived self-efficacy, and aspects of the family environments of participating parents. Parents and willing adolescents completed the APBA during the intake phase of the TANDEM programme. Sixteen mothers (M = 42.20 years of age, SD = 5.74 years) and 6 fathers (M = 43.29 years of age, SD = 10.40 years), together with 19 adolescents, completed the APBA and the commencement of the programme. Adolescent age and gender was not taken into account due to the small sample size. Measures of parents&#8217; depression, anxiety, and stress were also taken during the intake phase. During the intake phase, parents were also invited to describe the current quality of the home environment and parent adolescent relationship, as well as their chosen strategies for dealing with adolescent problems. Statistically significant differences were found for all assessment domains between the normative and TANDEM adolescent and parent samples, resulting in the total sample of 22 parents being offered a place in the TANDEM-parenting course. All parents accepted this offer and completed the parenting course. The researcher, drawing upon relevant research literature, qualitative data from a small normative parent sample, and prior clinical experience, also developed a 147- page parent manual for use by parents throughout the course. Due to the researcher&#8217;s familiarity with the manual contents, a presenter&#8217;s manual was not developed, with the manual itself being used by the researcher as a guide to presentation. Measures of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as measures of parent resilience, parenting skill, and self-perceived efficacy were taken once more at the conclusion of the parenting course, thus providing pre and post measures of intervention effectiveness. Apart from the latter three questionnaires contained in the APBA, the complete APBA was not administered again since notable positive shifts in adolescent problem behaviour were not anticipated over the relatively short six-week duration of the parenting course. Following the removal of one outlier, statistical analyses of remaining data indicated marginal improvements in resilience, and notable improvements in skill competency and self-efficacy. Parents&#8217; comments at the conclusion of the course supported these findings. In particular, parents reported noteworthy progress in relationships with their adolescents and partners, and a personally enhanced sense of well-being. Two booster sessions were provided, scheduled at four-weekly intervals. However, due to parents&#8217; requests, data was not obtained at these sessions. Alternative arrangements for gaining this data from future booster sessions have been considered. Strengths and weaknesses evident from this research in the TANDEM programme, together with directions for future research, have been discussed in the concluding chapter. The TANDEM programme was found to be a simple, affordable, readily adaptable, and effective means of identifying and ameliorating adolescent problem behaviour. Placing an essentially central focus on the parent in this process enabled the parent to become a successful role model and beneficially therapeutic source for the troubled adolescent. Parents who have participated in this and other TANDEM programmes have described the experience as providing them with a valuable means of supporting the difficulties of their adolescents. As a result, parents have been able to reestablish fundamentally protective family environments and more robust relationships with their adolescent son or daughter.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/320</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical appraisal of marine and coastal policy in Indonesia including comparative issues and lesson learnts [sic] from Australia</field><field name="creator">Rudiyanto, Arifin</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts an interdisciplinary approach. It examines the development of marine and coastal policy in Indonesia and explores how well Indonesia is governing its marine and coastal space and resources and with what effects and consequences. This thesis uses a policy analysis framework, with legislative and institutional activity as the basic unit of analysis. Three factors are identified as having been the major influences on the evolution of marine and coastal policy in Indonesia. These are international law, marine science and &#8220;state of the art&#8221; marine and coastal management. The role of these factors in the management of the coastal zone, living and non-living marine resources, marine science and technology, the marine environment and relevant international relations are analysed and discussed in the Indonesian case. This thesis concludes that Indonesia&#8217;s major challenges in terms of sustainable marine and coastal development are (a) to establish an appropriate management regime, and (b) to formulate and implement a combination of measures in order to attain the objectives of sustainable development. The basic problem is the fact that currently, Indonesia is not a &#8220;marine oriented&#8221; nation. Therefore, marine and coastal affairs are not at the top of the public policy agenda. Principles of international instruments have influenced the establishment of marine and coastal policy and management in Indonesia. However, in the implementation of sound management practices, Indonesia faces many challenges. The distinctive characteristics of Indonesia as an archipelagic nation underpin the basic philosophy of marine and coastal policy and management. With the increasing priority of marine and coastal policy in national development, science and environmental aspects have been able to play a greater role in policy development. ii A number of lessons can be taken from the Australian experience that may have some relevance to how Indonesia meets the challenges of implementing its new marine and coastal policy. For example, Indonesia needs to follow the lead of Australia, establishing national principles, goals and objectives for the sustainable of Indonesia&#8217;s marine and coastal resources and the conservation, protection and restoration of the marine and coastal environment. The solution for major marine and coastal management problems between federal and states, such as Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) and Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment (IGAE), offer an attractive alternative for the implementation of regional autonomy in Indonesia. Also, there is a need for multi-stakeholder involvement throughout the policy development process. In readiness for the 21st Century, the Guidelines of State Policy (GBHN) 1999 stated a shift of paradigm from &#8216;terrestrial oriented&#8217; towards &#8216;marine oriented&#8217; development. Indonesia started to give more priority to marine and coastal development and now faces the challenges posed by the transition from issue analysis and planning to the implementation of policies. One way or the other, it is reasonable to conclude that new forces and new needs are likely to bring change and improvement to marine and coastal governance in Indonesia over the next decade or so. iii</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/368</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory evaluation and modelling of shear strength of infilled joints under constant normal stiffness (CNS) conditions</field><field name="creator">Welideniya, H. Senaka</field><field name="description">Infill materials found in natural rock joints may cause a reduction in joint shear strength, influencing rock mass stability. The shear strength of rock mass, already reduced by these discontinuities, will further diminish if they are filled with sediments, thereby posing significant concerns for any construction or excavation carried out in rock. These concerns invite accurate quantification of the shear strength of infilled joints and proper understanding of the basic mechanics of discontinua and the principles involved in their shear deformation. The practical application of any models developed through such studies will be of immense help to mining, tunnelling, and all other underground construction works. The geotechnical research work carried out by the University of Wollongong in the late 90&#8217;s included infilled joint modelling using hyperbolic techniques. A new shear strength model was developed in these studies for predicting unfilled and infilled joint strength based on the Fourier transform method, energy balance principle and the hyperbolic stress-strain simulation.                                         Taking into account the field conditions frequently encountered, the diversity observed in joint shear response and the occasional inadequacy of data (for the estimation of Fourier coefficients and the hyperbolic constants), this study was undertaken to develop a semi-empirical methodology for predicting the shear strength of infilled joints. In this research study joint shear behaviour was studied under CNS and CNL conditions and also the effect of joint orientation and confinement. The study aimed to develop a methodology which includes joint surface characteristics, joint properties, and infill materials. A new model for predicting the shear strength of infilled joints based on a series of tests carried out on two types of model joint surfaces (with asperity angles of 9.50 and 18.50) is presented. Graphite, bentonite and clayey sand were used as infill materials. All tests were carried out in a large-scale shear apparatus under constant normal stiffness (CNS) conditions. The results indicate that at low infill thickness to asperity height ratio (t/a), the combined effect of the basic friction angle (&#981;b) and the joint asperity angle (i) is pronounced, but diminishes with increasing t/a ratio so that the shear strength converges towards the infill alone. This decrease in shear strength with increasing t/a ratio is represented in a normalised manner by dividing the peak shear stress by the corresponding normal stress. Summation of two algebraic functions (A and B) that represent the joint and infill characteristics, correctly model the decay of normalised shear strength with increasing t/a ratio. The new model successfully describes the shear strength of the graphite, clay (bentonite) and clayey sand filled model joints.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/392</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The thematic development of the magical child in fifteen recent New Zealand novels</field><field name="creator">Crawford, Jennifer M.</field><field name="description">Fifteen New Zealand novels, published between 1983 and 2000, are considered with regard to their representation of the magical child figure. The child is a benign and regenerative figure in the earlier works in this period, with its magical qualities used to heighten its role in a redemptive progression towards the reform of social structures depicted as damaging of cultural and environmental heritage. Later in the period the regenerative possibilities offered by the child diminish, as the relationship between the individual child and adult society diversifies. Where a clear adult/child dichotomy in the early works renders the child as essentially positive and life-giving, the later, more complex field renders the child as less symbolically powerful, more individually threatening and less physically and characteristically distinct from the adult. The novels examined are Keri Hulme&#8217;s the bone people, Patricia Grace&#8217;s Potiki, Cousins and Baby No Eyes, Witi Ihimaera&#8217;s The Whale Rider, The Matriarch and The Dream Swimmer, Rachel McAlpine&#8217;s The Limits of Green, Fiona Farrell&#8217;s The Skinny Louie Book, Elizabeth Knox&#8217;s Treasure, Sue Reidy&#8217;s The Visitation, John Cranna&#8217;s Arena, Anne Kennedy&#8217;s A Boy and His Uncle, Anthony McCarten&#8217;s Spinners and Peter Hawes&#8217;s A Dream of Nikau Jam. The novels are considered within the context of the history of the child character in literature, and particularly of the thematic traditions surrounding child characters throughout twentieth century New Zealand literature. The simultaneous vitality and vulnerability of the child figure, and the transcendent qualities of the magical child, are found to be critical to its construction. These qualities are examined through the Crawford 9 novels&#8217; representations of filiation, nationhood and in the persistent construction of a symbolic relationship between the magical child and various manifestations of a metaphysical void.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/393</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Practical methodologies for agent-oriented conceptual modelling</field><field name="creator">Krishna, Aneesh</field><field name="description">Many modelling techniques tend to address &#8220;late-phase&#8221; requirements while many critical modelling decisions (such as determining the main goals of the system, how the stakeholders depend on each other, and what alternatives exist) are taken during early-phase requirements engineering.

The high-level and abstract nature of these models poses special challenges in devising elicitation techniques. Second, there has been limited adoption of agentoriented conceptual modelling techniques in industry.We address the first challenge by developing a novel elicitation technique based on requirements capture templates. These templates can themselves be derived from enterprise/ domain ontologies and organisational models, and interact with these in interesting ways.Our approach to addressing the second problem is based on the observation that the value of conceptual modelling in the i* framework lies in its use as a notation complementary to existing requirements modelling and specification languages, i.e., the expressive power of i* complements rather than supplants that of existing notations. The use of i* in this fashion requires that we define methodologies that support the co-evolution of i* models with more traditional specifications. This research uses the notion of co-evolution in a very specific sense to describe a class of methodologies that permit i* modelling to proceed independently of specification in a distinct notation, while maintaining some modicum of loose coupling via consistency constraints. This research examines how this might be done with formal specification notations (specifically Z) as well as an industry standard modelling language (UML). Our aim, then, is to support the modelling of organisational contexts, intentions and rationale in i*,  while traditional specifications of functionality and design proceeds in either the formal notation or UML. Much of this research has been motivated by issues arising from an industry-scale enterprise modelling exercise conducted for an emergency services agency.This research has been validated through a detailed case study involving a major government emergency services agency (who provided funding for this project). A very large-scale and comprehensive agent-oriented conceptual model of this agency and its requirements has been developed, and forms the basis for the validation component of this dissertation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/519</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical enquiry into privatisation of state-owned enterprises: the case of PT Semen Gresik (Persero) TBK. Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Irianto, Gugus</field><field name="description">Privatisation has been interpreted in a variety of ways. It encompasses a variety of aspects such as ideology, politics, the economy, financial, as well as social implications and the global context. Above all, privatisation is conclusively understood as a medium of &#8216;reality&#8217; construction. It is a policy that does create a newly constructed distribution of wealth and power and reveals conflicts of interests among various parties.The fundamental determinant of privatisation is ideological, which is the government&#8217;s inclination to praise laissez faire (liberalism/neo-liberalism) rather than interventionist systems. The other central issue of privatisation is about efficiency or performance of state ownership vis-&#224;-vis private ownership. Beyond these aspects, privatisation is commonly exercised by countries that are in the middle of a deep economic crisis, facing soaring foreign debt, dealing with a widening budget deficit and dependent on international agencies, particularly the IMF and the World Bank (Ramamurty, 1992).Considering the nature of privatisation, a study on privatisation of stateowned enterprises is argued to be best placed in such a context. Such a study is parallel to the call to study accounting within its environment. Whilst a variety of theoretical frameworks of critical accounting studies are available, this study utilises one of them which is the political economy of accounting (PEA), a theoretical framework pioneered by Tinker (1980), advanced in the works of Cooper and Sherer (1984) and others and &#8216;applied&#8217; in the case of privatisation, such as, in the works of Shaoul (1997a, 1997b), Arnold and Cooper (1999), and Uddin and Hopper (2001, 2003).Grounded in such a framework, this study is an enquiry into the privatisation of PT Semen Gresik (Persero) Tbk., a state-owned enterprise in Indonesia which operates in the cement industry. The privatisation of this company was carried out as part of broader policy reforms and executed at three consecutive times in 1991, 1995, and 1998. These gradual divestments have been completed within different contexts. The latest partial divestment sparked heavy opposition to the hegemonic nature of MNCs from various stakeholders. A variety of issues ranging from justice and fairness, job security, financial aspects, to the economic sovereignty have been raised. Accounting and accountants are at the nerve centre of such discourse. Whilst various deficiencies are apparent in the &#8216;construction&#8217; of such policy, above all, the case raises the fundamental issue of the distribution of wealth and power, which, unlike that in Malaysia, the Indonesian government has failed to address.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/522</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of the fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy</field><field name="creator">Yahia, Abdusalam F</field><field name="description">The Socialist People&#8217;s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya is a small oil-producing developing economy in North Africa. Its economy depends heavily on oil revenue. Oil exports accounted for 92-97 percent of annual total Libyan exports and contributed 40-60 percent of annual GDP during the period 1963-2006. The Libyan economy, like other Middle Eastern oil producers, has been subject to several strong external shocks resulting from fluctuations in oil prices since September 1973. Economic conditions of the Libyan economy worsened in the 1990&#8217;s as a result of international sanctions. Since the ending of the UN sanctions in 1999, Libya has been implementing measures to reform and open its economy. Libya needs strong and sustained economic growth to meet the demands of its rapidly growing labour force, which require high investment in physical and human capital and an efficient use of the country&#8217;s resources. However, the achievement of these objectives depends on oil prices. The aim of this thesis is to find out the impact of the fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy during the period of 1963-2004. The thesis tries to contribute to literature by examining the effects of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth; Libyan investment; the patterns of Libyan imports and trade relationship with its major trading partners. This thesis also attempts to assess the impact of fluctuation in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balance of payments. Many researchers devoted their time and skill in tackling problems related to trade and growth. However, the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing economies came to the interest of some researchers only recently and more precisely since the oil embargo in late 1973.  Despite the growing literature on the impact of fluctuations in oil exports on the performance of oil-producing countries in the Middle East, it appears that many gaps still exist in the current literature.  In particular no attempt has been made to examine the impact of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan economy and in particular on Libyan economic growth, Libyan gross fixed capital formation, Libyan imports, the feedback effects in Libyan trade with its major importers and effects of fluctuations in oil prices on the performance of the Libyan balances of payments. Sophisticated economic models and econometric techniques have been utilized in this thesis in order to achieve its objectives. These models and techniques include single equation models, simultaneous equations models, forecasting models and co-integration analysis. The fluctuations in oil prices had very important effects on the Libyan labor force, sectoral employment, Libyan social and development indicators, contribution of various economic activities, Libyan expenditure, Libyan composition of foreign trade and Libyan balance of payments. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on Libyan economic growth using the &#8220;export as an engine of growth model&#8221; and applying a &#8220;Koyck distributed lag scheme&#8221; suggest that there are spread effects from oil exports to the rest of the economy. However, when both the component and inflationary effects are excluded (but not the real gain from the rise in export prices) the results suggest no evidence of spread effects. This conclusion is supported by sectoral output analysis. The use of co-integration analysis to examine the long-term trade relationship between Libyan GDP and its oil exports suggest that there is no long-term relationship between Libyan oil exports and non-oil GDP. In other words, the two variables do drift too far apart from each other over time. The impact of fluctuations in oil prices on investment in the Libyan economy was assessed using an accelerator model of investment to capture investment behavior in the Libyan economy. It was revealed that the Libyan capital formation is strongly influenced by spending on components of aggregate demand other than investment and the downturn in oil prices had a serious adverse effect on investment. There seems to be an existence of some bottlenecks Also, investment in the Libyan economy was mainly autonomous public investment in infrastructure. To find out if there is a long-term relationship between investment and other components of aggregate demand (private consumption + public consumption + net exports) in the Libyan economy, the co-integration technique was used. The long-run elasticity of investment expenditure in the Libyan economy, with respect to Libyan expenditure on other components of aggregate demand, was higher than the short-run elasticity during the period of boom of oil exports. However, there is no evidence of long-term relationships between investment and other components of aggregate demand in the Libyan economy. The analyses of the trade relationship between Libya and its major trading partners, using a simultaneous-equations model, suggest that an increase in Libyan&#8217;s exports to a major trading partner contributes to growth in Libyan GDP. The increase in Libyan income expands its imports from its major trading partners. This in turn contributed to growth in the income of the trade partners. The level of Libyan imports from its major trading partners does not seem to have any significant effect on the level of the GDP of its major trading partners except Greece, Turkey and Tunisia. The relationship between imports of various commodity groups and per capita income in the Libyan economy during variety periods of fluctuation in oil prices were evaluated using two-digit SIT classifications and five forms of import income function. It has been indicated that the reduction in oil revenue during the period of low oil prices has completely upset the import-income relationship, which was developed during the boom years, while the rise in oil revenue has recreated an improvement in the relationship. Single and simultaneous-equations models are developed and tested to examine the impact of the external and internal forces on Libyan balance of payments. The results are used in forecasting the future behavior of this balance under various scenarios. The analysis indicates that the ratio of trade balance to GDP has fluctuated sharply with changes in the world price of oil.  The decline in oil exports combined with deficit in the services balance and net current transfers depleted the gains from trade surplus in the Libyan economy.  This resulted in a continuous decline in the current account surplus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/95</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of intervention with relatives of treatment resistant drinkers: changes in relatives' psychological functioning and drinkers' behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Fairbairn, Janis</field><field name="description">Forty three research participants (40 female, 3 male) who were in ongoing contact with treatment resistant dependent drinkers, completed the 10 session FOCUS intervention at the Australian Institute of Alcohol and Addictions (Holyoake) in Perth, Western Australia. This Holyoake intervention focussed exclusively on the needs of relatives of excessive drinkers and did not teach relatives how to encourage their drinkers into treatment. The intervention aimed to minimise the harm experienced by relatives by improving their well being and coping, and assisting them to recognise behaviours which may unwittingly enable their drinkers&#8217; excessive consumption to continue. Participants were allocated to one of 2 groups; viz. Immediate Entry to treatment or Waitlist. The Waitlist group commenced treatment at the completion of the waitlist period. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively and there was a high level of consistency between the two analyses. The quantitative data were analysed by repeated measures MANOVA with treatment and time (pre, mid, end treatment and 3 months and 6 months post treatment) as the independent variables. Given the quasi-experimental design, the results need to be viewed cautiously. It appeared that the Holyoake intervention produced significant improvements in participants&#8217; mental health, coping, and relationship status which were sustained through 6 months post treatment. Moreover, as a &#8220;spin off&#8221; of treatment (according to participants&#8217; observations), a significant, sustained reduction in the amount of alcohol their drinkers consumed on any given drinking day was identified. Twenty five participants did not complete the intervention and 13 of these (the Late Dropout group) were available for follow up 5 weeks after completing 5 treatment sessions. Despite the small sample size, a pattern of significant effect similar to the Full Treatment group was evident on participants&#8217; mental health and coping status. Moreover, it seemed that the &#8220;spin off&#8221; effect of treatment on drinkers&#8217; abusive behaviour and consumption patterns was more pervasive for the Late Dropout group. These data suggested that the Late Dropout group may have decided to terminate treatment because their situations had improved. Participants&#8217; raw data (n=68), which included all participants who had commenced treatment, revealed that whilst 69% of their drinkers had either sought help (n=13) or reduced their consumption to some degree, 50% had made substantial change. Given data was analysed wherever possible by the intention to treat principle, these figures were also expressed in terms of all participants who had been allocated to treatment (n=83). Thus, the least favourable &#8220;spin off&#8221; effect on drinkers&#8217; behaviour appeared to be that whilst 57% had made some degree of positive change, 41% had made substantial change. Content analyses of the Full Treatment group&#8217;s qualitative interviews (n=43) revealed that only 16% of participants predominantly used assertive coping strategies to deal with difficult situations with their drinkers prior to the Holyoake intervention. However, by the end of the intervention, participants&#8217; use of assertive behaviours had increased dramatically to 81%; e.g. clear messages, emotional control and confidence, improved boundaries and communication, and assertive confrontation. Sixty seven percent of participants identified their own personal empowerment (i.e. self responsibility and self efficacy) as the most important factor which had helped them deal more effectively with their situations. This research in no way suggested that participants were in any way responsible for their drinkers' behaviour. It has merely highlighted the considerable influence one family member has on another. Therefore, this research seemed to debunk the widely held belief that dependent, treatment resistant drinkers cannot be helped until they admit their problem, and actively seek help.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/321</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the fabrication and characterisation of high temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 thin films</field><field name="creator">Li, Aihua</field><field name="description">Thin films of the high temperature superconductor (HTS) YBa2Cu3O7 (Y123) are of great potential in a wide range of applications, including low-loss microwave cavities and filters, bolometers, various superconducting terminal devices, flux transformers, and dc and rf superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). They also have the potential to give insight into the fundamental mechanisms governing high temperature superconductivity. Y123 coated conductors, the so-called second generation superconducting tapes, which are based on Y123 thin film technology, also have great applications in carrying large superconducting currents. However, some important challenges or fundamental problems hindering their practical applications need to be solved scientifically. These include: finding the most effective and economic approaches to enhance the superconducting critical current density in high magnetic fields; reducing the fabrication cost with high reproducibility; arriving at a profound understanding of the relationship between microstructure and superconducting performance, etc. The work described in this thesis deals with these challenges, with an emphasis on fundamental studies on supercurrent enhancement through nanotechnology and nanoengineering using advanced thin film fabrication methods, including pulsed laser deposition and spin coating, and on the relationship between microstructure and supercurrent performance.An overview of the research on HTS thin films in the period from 2000 to the end of 2005 is given in Chapter I. Attention was paid to both Y123 films and coated conductors fabricated using both PLD and chemical methods, on both single crystal and metallic substrates. The related electrical and magnetic properties are also reviewed. In the first part of the thesis work, Y123 thin films with and without Ag nanoparticle inclusions were grown by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on YSZ (100), SrTiO3 (100), and LaAlO3 (100) single crystal substrates. A discontinuous layer of Ag nanodots was deposited on the substrates prior to the deposition of Y123 films. The Y123 films grown on such surfaces modified with Ag nanodots were extensively characterised by atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), AC susceptibility and DC magnetisation. The effects of the density of Ag nanodots, which was controlled by the numbers of PLD shots, on the microstructures and resultant critical current density Jc have been studied systematically. Results showed that under fixed physical deposition conditions Jc increased monotonically with the number of Ag shots, n, for films grown on both STO and LAO substrates. At 77 K, the Jc increased from 106 to 3.2 &#215;106 A/cm2 for LAO and from 8&#215;105 to 3.5&#215;106 A/cm2 for STO as n increased from 0 to 150. At 5 K, the Jc was enhanced by approximately four times at both low and high fields. These values obtained due to nano-Ag inclusions are comparable to the best results achieved by other prestigious research groups around the world. However, for films grown on YSZ substrate, Jc increased from 2&#215;105 to 2&#215;106 A/cm2 as Ag shots increased from 0 to 30, and decreased to 9&#215;105 for n &#179; 60. Detailed microstructure investigations indicated that the crystallinity and ab alignment gradually improved as the number of Ag-nano-dots increased. In the second part of the thesis work, YBa2Cu3Oy films were grown on single crystalline YSZ, SrTiO3, and MgO, and on polycrystalline Ag substrates using non-fluorine sol-gel and spin coating methods. The effects of heat treatment conditions on the phase evolution and microstructures were investigated using optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and atomic force microscopy. A detailed study was performed on the phase formation, degree of grain orientation, formation of cracks, and surface morphologies. It was found that sintering temperature and roughness of substrate surfaces are two key factors in controlling crack morphologies. With several important advantages, including precursor solution stability, improved film density, and elimination of HF during processing, high-quality YBCO films have been achieved on single crystal substrates with transport critical current densities up to 106 A/cm2. An extensive study was carried out on the alteration of precursor solution stoichiometry and its effects on superconducting properties. Fluorine-free sol-gel&#8211;derived films on the LAO substrate exhibited epitaxial growth with excellent in- and out-of-plane texture. Experimental details are given on the sol-gel synthesis chemistry and XRD and TEM characterization of the YBCO thin films.The phase evolution of YBCO films prepared by the fluorine-free sol-gel method was also systematically investigated using in-situ high temperature optical microscope observations and x-ray diffraction. The conversion sequences and the final resultant products have been determined for barium, copper and yttrium containing precursors, respectively. It was found that those conversions are strongly dependent on the experimental conditions such as water partial pressure. The formation of YBCO starts at a temperature of around 710 oC and lasts up to 800 oC over about 15 min. Depending on the barium containing phases and experimental conditions. It is suggested that a- and caxis YBCO grains are governed by different reactions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/520</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real-time operating system in Java</field><field name="creator">Lu, Qinghua</field><field name="description">Real-time operating systems (RTOSes) are required to run for years, and never fail, without human intervention. Safety is the primary concern for RTOSes because they usually control physical equipment. One strand of real-time operating system (RTOS) research is looking at the question: can developing an RTOS in a safe language result in a system that an errant process can&#8217;t crash?  Choosing a good programming language can significantly improve the safety of the RTOS.  In this thesis, we examine the advantages and associated problems of writing RTOSes in a safe language, namely Java.  We design an RTOS named JARTOS that schedules processes on a micro-controller called TINI. The code of the JARTOS system is mainly written in Java, since Java provides both static and dynamic safety. The Java compiler handles potentially unsafe operations rather than the programmer.  Also, Java includes run-time support to catch and handle run-time errors.JARTOS is designed to be a time-sharing system, where cooperative multiprocessing is used to schedule real-time processes. JARTOS switches processes on a timer interrupt. Each process is required to execute quickly and then give up the processor. Otherwise it will be timed out. To implement a timeout, JARTOS supports a timer interrupt that regularly updates a clock and checks for timeouts. To keep the number of interrupts to a minimum, input/output is done using polling where possible.  Also, interrupts code is designed to be transparent to the processes. An interrupt handler sets flags and values, and then returns to the process it interrupted.In the context of achieving real-time performance, we look at the issues of implementing our system design in Java. We introduce how we used Java constructs to implement the design of JARTOS, and how we solved the low-level issues. RTOSes have to guarantee that real-time processes execute within specified time dead-lines. Loss of synchronization can occur when deadlines are not met. Timing problems are often very difficult to find. In JARTOS, we designed a set of performance measurements to investigate timing problems. These performance measurements are carefully designed to provide the right information at minimal cost in performance. Performance of TINI and JARTOS are measured and discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/29</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the Burma Socialist Party (1930-1964)</field><field name="creator">Win, Kyaw Zaw</field><field name="description">This dissertation seeks to demonstrate the legacy and historical significance of the Burma Socialist Party (BSP), and so, to solve major puzzles for scholars of Burmese history, particularly with regard to how the links between civilian and military groups in politics in Burma came about. Thus, this thesis addresses a major gap in the current historical literature, which has tended to underplay or ignore the role of the BSP. In so doing this work draws a wide range of interviews, archives and hitherto unused research sources, as well as the historical analyses in English and Burmese contribute. The thesis begins by examining the historical and cultural antecedents of the BSP. The party was formed as a major element of Burma&#8217;s independence movement, which developed from a core group of nationalist leaders. Among these leaders were founders and key members of the future BSP. The Peoples&#8217; Revolutionary Party (PRP), the prewar version of the BSP, emerged in the struggle for independence and played a key role in that struggle as a core group around which the future state was founded. After the War, the BSP came out as separate party to compete with the Communist Party of Burma (CPB). The Tatmadaw played a key role in this process, and thus the process itself was a crucial turning point in Burma&#8217;s history. The BSP was the main political party after Burma&#8217;s independence in 1948. This situation can be seen through looking at the way the Anti-Fascist Peoples&#8217; Freedom League (AFPFL) operated as the umbrella of the BSP. The BSP shaped domestic and foreign policies in the period 1948-58, and provided the basis of various forms of government, even at times of internal division. It was in these circumstances that the military aspect of Burmese politics became important. Careful examination of the sources dealing with the major political influences of the post-independence period shows that the Burmese military took their ideas from the BSP and launched their bid for power by taking over from the BSP.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of clinical indicators and social context for developing lifestyle modification programs after gestational diabetes mellitus: a case study of a cohort of women in the Illawarra region, Australia</field><field name="creator">Barnard, Janelle</field><field name="description">Women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a 30-50% future risk of developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a global public health problem.  Preventive approaches would target diet and physical activity behaviours yet little is known about these lifestyle parameters in this group. This thesis describes the diet, physical activity and risk factor profile of a sample of women with previous GDM from the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. A comprehensive ethnographic description is created profiling the sample using both quantitative (surveys, diet and physical activity measurements and clinical assessments) and qualitative techniques (in depth interviews). The central hypothesis is that, while the need for diet and physical intervention may be clearly demonstrated in this group of women, the complexities of their lives needs to be considered when developing how these interventions might be delivered.It is reasonable to assume that providing interventions for women with small children may pose practical and social challenges that warrant consideration in program design.The main aim of the research was therefore to assess the extent of the need for intervention for an identifiable cohort of women and qualify this with and an in-depth analysis of these practical and social issues. Subjects were recruited from the database of women referred to the Illawarra Diabetes Service who would be 10-25 months post-partum at the time of the study. Of a potential 150 subjects, 52 were accessible and completed a telephone interview, 19 completed a more in-depth cross-sectional survey, and 21 completed in-depth interviews with a further ten &#8220;support&#8221; people recruited through a snowballing technique. The health profile of the subjects confirmed the need for diet and activity intervention. Ten of 18 women completing a standard glucose tolerance test produced an abnormal result and were advised to seek further medical care. Dietary intake patterns were not in keeping with current recommendations for the prevention of T2DM  (total fat 34.9&#177;7.7%, SFA 13.2&#177;4.0%, PUFA 5.5&#177;1.7%  compared to targets of (less than)30%, (less than)10% and (greater than)10% respectively). While 16 of 19 women met physical activity guidelines, the research indicated that further work on the nature of physical activity in this group warrants consideration and that current, more general physical activity guidelines for the prevention of T2DM be adapted for this group. Most of the women (47 out of 51) initially expressed an interest in lifestyle programs but indicated that time and childcare barriers would prevail. In-depth interviews indicated that there were differences between women in relation to the potential accessibility of lifestyle intervention programs and that this may rest on feelings of empowerment within the limited capacity of family systems. Opportunities for lifestyle intervention in healthcare services are likely to lie within a model of family-centred therapy. This acknowledges that the lives of these women are embedded in an interdependent network of individuals forming the family system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/853</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The isotopic signature of nitrous oxide emitted from agricultural soils measured by FTIR spectroscopy</field><field name="creator">Parkes, Stephen</field><field name="description">Agriculture contributes 16% to Australia&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions, of which 23% are the result of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Global N2O emissions from agricultural activities have increased substantially since the beginning of the industrial revolution. This has been driven by the increase in the amount of nitrogen added to agricultural soils, stimulating the N2O-producing nitrification and denitrification processes. Currently there is a poor quantitative understanding of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification and their controlling parameters. This is difficult to quantify since N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification occur simultaneously. As N2O produced from these microbial processes have different stable isotopic signatures, stable isotope measurements have shown promise as a method to partition N2O emissions. Additionally, the intramolecular 15N site preference of N2O presents a further stable isotopic measurement which can be used for studies of N2O emissions from nitrification and denitrification. In this thesis, the absolute intramolecular 15N site preference of N2O measured using high resolution FTIR. The FTIR system was fully calibrated for site preference measurements of 15N enriched N2O sample. In addition, using the FTIR system the absolute site preference value for the N2O working standard used as a reference for isotopic measurements was determined. Using this absolute site preference value, it was possible to determine a value of 19.9 (&#177;2.1)&#8240; for the absolute site preference of tropospheric N2O. The absolute site preference value of the N2O working standard was used to report measurements of field collected N2O samples on the absolute scale. To determine the intramolecular site preference of N2O produced from nitrification and denitrification, a 2 week field campaign was completed at a dairy farm in south eastern Australia. Soil plots were treated with 15N-labelled NH4 + or NO3 -, either at application rates of 100 or 50 kg-N.ha-1, followed by irrigation. Following treatment, daily measurements were made of the N2O emissions, isotopic composition of N2O, soil mineral nitrogen concentrations and 15N composition, as well as soil moisture. From the interpretation of the collected data, intramolecular site preference signatures of -17 (&#177;5)&#8240; was determined for nitrification and a range of 0.5 to 12.3&#8240; was attributed to denitrification. Using the 15N measurements of N2O, it was possible to estimate the N2O emissions produced from nitrification and denitrification. For all treatments, emissions produced from denitrification far outweighed those from nitrification. These measurements indicated that the reduction of N2O to N2 was a key process controlling N2O emissions. Additionally, there was a clear relationship between the intramolecular site preference of N2O, and the amount of N2O reduced to N2. This relationship was used to estimate that for treatments receiving NH4 +, 5 &#8211; 22% of the applied nitrogen was emitted as N2.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/129</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monetary policy transmission mechanism and structural breaks in Indonesia|</field><field name="creator">Afandi, Akhsyim</field><field name="description">This research studies the monetary policy transmission mechanisms in Indonesia. It aims at achieving six objectives. First, it investigates not only the channels associated with monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets but also those associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the goods market. Second, it assesses and compares the relative strength of each channel of monetary policy transmission, which has not been attempted previously in the case of the Indonesia. This attempt is made possible by the use of a single model to investigate the multiple channels of monetary policy transmission. Third, it examines whether the 1998 financial crisis has changed the course of each channel of monetary policy transmission. Specifically, whether the role played by each channel in the monetary policy transmission weakened or strengthened is investigated. Fourth, to achieve these objectives a structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model of the Indonesian economy is constructed. However, before these objectives are addressed the issue of whether the monetary policy shocks have plausible macroeconomic effects is dealt with. To that end, a nonrecursive identifying strategy is applied. Likewise, the complexity of the actual monetary policy conduct in Indonesia that makes it hard to single out the monetary policy instruments actually in use in Indonesia is mitigated by devising eight SVAR specifications. Fifth, it addresses the issue of non-stationary data in VAR modelling by conducting unit root test that allows for one and two endogenouslydetermined breaks. Specifically, this study examines the robustness of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test to the presence of one and/or more structural breaks. Given the fact that most time series data have structural breaks, such an attempt has not been done in the case of Indonesia. Finally, it attempts to solve the identification problem associated with bank lending channel using cointegration procedures based on the autoregressive distributive lag (ARDL) model and the impulse response function analysis that have not been applied to an Indonesian case. (One advantage of the ARDL approach is that it is appropriate irrespective of whether the time series data used are integrated of degree one or zero). SVAR model specification that captures the most plausible effects of monetary policy shocks is selected out of eight specifications of the SVAR model of the Indonesian economy estimated using both monthly and quarterly data from 1984M12- 2003M12 (1984Q4-2003Q4). The eight different SVAR models are estimated out of the fact that in reality there are four potential measures of monetary aggregates: total reserves, base money, narrow money (M1) and broad money (M2) and two potential measures of short-term interest rates: interbank call-money rate (R1) and SBI rate (interest rate on Bank Indonesia bills) (R2) as monetary policy instruments.Based on the estimated impulse response analyses, the specification that best captures the effects of monetary policy shocks, as expected by theory, is selected. Overall, the monthly eight-variable SVAR specification that uses M2 as measure of monetary aggregate and R1 as short-term interest rate is superior to the other specifications. However, the quarterly version of the same specification is superior to all other specifications because it resolves the exchange rate puzzle (the initial depreciation of exchange rate following a monetary tightening). This model specification is used to empirically assess the relative strength of channels associated with the monetary-policyinduced changes in the financial and goods markets. In regards to the latter, it has shown empirically, relying on the concept of contribution derived from estimated SVAR models, that consumption spending plays a predominant role in the monetary transmission mechanisms. This result is more in line with the findings regarding the United States than with those regarding the Europe and Japan. For the latter countries investment spending is predominant in the monetary transmission mechanisms. As for the channels associated with the monetary-policy-induced changes in the financial markets, this study finds that bank loans are dominant. The accumulated response of output attributed to this channel is stronger than the exchange rate and asset price channels. A monetary tightening shock leads to a fall in bank credit, with a lag of about three quarters. However, the importance of bank loans has been exaggerated by the credit crunch during the financial crisis period. The role of bank loans is weaker during the period before the financial crisis, although stronger than the other two channels. The finding on the bank lending channel suffers an identification problem: do the monetary-policy-induced movements in bank loans originate from the supply or demand side? The &#8220;credit view&#8221; of monetary policy transmission requires that the former is the case. The estimation of error correction models where the cointegating vectors allow for one structural break and are based on the Johansen&#8217;s and Autoregressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) procedures find that the former is the case. Further, the impulse response analysis based on both vector error correction (VEC) models of the bank loans market and the eight-variable SVAR corroborates this result irrespective of the origin of shock, monetary policy or otherwise. Likewise, the first requirement of the credit view that a monetary tightening by the central bank is capable of constraining the supply of bank loans is satisfied. Similarly, this analysis also satisfies the second requirement of the credit view that the monetary-induced decline in the supply of bank loans depresses aggregate spending due to the significance of the bank-dependent borrowers. Thus, the bank lending channel is confirmed. The exchange rate channel is found to be the weakest. The reason is that during and after the financial crisis there are anomalies associated with this channel. The exchange rate channel operates against the conventional wisdom. A monetary tightening shock is accompanied by exchange rate depreciation and subsequently weakening the level of economic activity. These anomalies disappear when the estimation covers observations before the financial crisis only. These anomalies are due to the fact that during the crisis period the exchange rate depreciation was so enormous that monetary policy tightening had little or no effect in arresting the depreciation pressure. Further, since Indonesia is a highly indebted economy the enormous exchange rate depreciation has inflated the foreign-currency-denominated debts and hence greatly worsened firms&#8217; balance sheets, thereby depressing firms&#8217; investment and productive capacity and hence the level of economic activity.As for the asset price channel, the results reveal that the equity price channel is also weaker than the bank loans channel but slightly stronger than the exchange rate channel. Due to the collapse of stock market and sharp decrease in the use of equity financing during the financial crisis period, the equity price channel of monetary policy transmission had weakened during that period. Further, to the extent that this channel follows Monetarist view or Tobin&#8217;s view, the latter seems to play a dominant role. That is, the real effect of this channel is mainly due to investment spending increases spurred by higher Tobin&#8217;s q resulting from the increase in stock price following a monetary easing. Finally, this study also confirms the occurrence of credit crunch following the financial crisis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/640</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of interculturality in the context of foreign language education: a case study of Japanese language learning in Australian primary schools</field><field name="creator">Ramzan, Yuko</field><field name="description">This research investigated the construction of interculturality in the context of foreign language education in Australian primary schools.  The study explored the curriculum areas of citizenship education and foreign language education within the Human Society and Its Environment Key Learning Area in NSW primary schools, focusing on how the curricula contribute to the goals of intercultural understanding, and examined the potential of applying Japanese language learning education as one of the tools to serve the development of students&#8217; interculturality.The methodology used for this study is a qualitative paradigm.  The study is a case study with multiple contexts including two primary schools, a high school and a university. The methodology and analysis are framed by grounded theory. The researcher&#8217;s position in conducting this study is underpinned by cultural theory.  Literature on globalisation, citizenship, language education and interculturality were explored.  The participants were thirty primary school students from two different schools, five high school students and the teachers of their Japanese language classes, five university students who are studying the Japanese language as their major, and other stakeholders.  The researcher explored the participants&#8217; perceptions and beliefs regarding the multiple issues of identity, Japanese language teaching and learning and the development of interculturality. In addition, classroom observations were conducted and recorded over several months, curriculum documents were analysed, and teacher seminars and professional development courses were attended.  The data analyses, coding and classifying, were conducted in three phases, each building upon the results of the other, as revealed in the grounded theory approach. The results of this study are discussed around three key themes: self-identity construction through Japanese language learning experiences; schools as sites of cultural production and reproduction where the students&#8217; development of self-identity is crucially influenced; and language education for interculturality.  The students&#8217; school is a crucial location for the development of interculturality, where the curriculum can be planned to stimulate their subjective awareness of self, which is an important process in the development of this quality. The result indicates that Japanese language education can be a tool to promote and develop interculturality. Recommendations have been proposed in three major areas: the position of language education in the school curriculum; teachers&#8217; professional development to enhance their interculturality; and future research. Language education should be a compulsory subject within any primary school curriculum. It is revealed that the importance of developing interculturality has to be manifested, not as a by-product of schooling, but should be purposefully directed. The notion of intercultural competency while learning a foreign language opens up new dimensions for the language teaching arena. Professional development of teachers, and longitudinal research to follow the outcomes of new language teaching approaches are crucial for today&#8217;s society.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/810</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulating the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of shipping and other vessel based activities in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area</field><field name="creator">Aston, James Peter</field><field name="description">The Great Barrier Reef sustains a variety of commercial and recreational activities and livelihoods including fishing, tourism, recreation and shipping. Those activities pose a source of harm to the biodiversity, use and amenity values of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The threat of day-to-day shipping operations on the Reef&#8217;s ecosystem is largely unquantified but could represent a not inconsequential contribution to the overall levels of contaminants entering the Marine Park, potentially diminishing the amenity or water quality at sites which are already affected by other activities or susceptible to influxes of land sourced pollutants. There is also the potential for more serious impacts to the outstanding natural, social and economic values of the region following a major shipping accident. While the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is the principal custodian of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the administration of a suite of measures to regulate all ships and vessel activities in the region is shared with two other Commonwealth government authorities and one state government authority. The complexity of international and domestic shipping and environmental protection laws presents many challenges for the region&#8217;s responsible management. This thesis examines the environmental and socioeconomic impacts to the Reef from the operations of ships and other vessel based activities and the practical application and effect of regulatory measures that have been developed and implemented to remedy those impacts. It describes the origins, development and implementation of the key ship routeing initiatives in the form of compulsory pilotage, a vessel traffic service and provisions under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 to control use and access to high conservation zones. It also analyses recent developments at international and national law prescribing actions that can be taken to deal with operational vessel sourced waste discharges, the administrative arrangements for dealing with a maritime casualty as well the preparedness and response to oil and chemical spills. A significant part of the intellectual value of the thesis is derived from analysing the operation and interaction of international, Commonwealth and Queensland State marine pollution legislation and identifying issues which could affect the efficacy of those laws and related measures in protecting the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage Area. The findings of the research support the premise that shipping and other vessel based activities within the Great Barrier Reef are generally conducted to a high standard. Nonetheless, as shipping and other vessel based activities continue to expand within the region, so does the risk of an accident or marine pollution event. It is suggested that the ship regulatory authorities should judiciously apply the precautionary principle and keep under review the widest possible range of ship safety, marine pollution prevention and environmental standards and measures available under international law to ensure the Great Barrier Reef remains a national and international icon.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/64</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy analysis of workplace rehabilitation policy within workers' compensation arrangements in NSW coal mines from 1987 to 1997: towards improved occupational health outcomes for injured coal miners</field><field name="creator">Pelham, Natalie</field><field name="description">Workplace rehabilitation gained greater prominence as a means of both containing the costs of workers&#8217; compensation claims and improving return to work outcomes for injured workers following a period of policy debate and reform from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. As a result, rehabilitation was integrated into workers&#8217; compensation arrangements throughout Australia. However, coal mines in NSW took a different path, one which did not fully integrate rehabilitation into its workers&#8217; compensation arrangements (hybrid model). This thesis set out to examine why coal mines in NSW took a different path and the implications through the following research questions: 1) How did the hybrid model for workplace rehabilitation within workers&#8217; compensation arrangements in NSW coal mines (at 1996) differ from that in place in other NSW industries? 2) Why was workplace rehabilitation not fully implemented into workers&#8217; compensation arrangements for NSW coal mines? What factors influenced the decision-making process and led to the hybrid model (1987 &#8211; 1997)? 3) How did workplace rehabilitation programs in NSW coal mines (at 1996) compare to those recommended in the literature? 4) How did the hybrid model work in practice in NSW coal mines (at 1996)? What was its impact on the delivery of workplace rehabilitation?  Was it working effectively? Where and Where not? Why and why not? 5) How could effective workplace rehabilitation programs be delivered in NSW coal mines? 6) What conclusions may be drawn in relation to the public policy process and what recommendations may be made for workplace rehabilitation policy in NSW coal mines?Using a policy analysis framework described by Hill1, this thesis examined the various influences on policy formulation and  implementation in order to understand the public policy making process better. How the hybrid model differed from the recommended integrated model (research question 1) was determined through a comparison of the two models. This identified points of difference and therefore points of potential influence in policy development.An historical analysis and interviews were conducted to understand why the integrated model was not fully implemented in NSW coal mines (research question 2). This assisted the Researcher to identify individuals, groups and organised interests that were involved in the development of this policy, their roles and how they exerted influence over policy formulation.A literature review of previous research  findings in rehabilitation and return to work was undertaken (research question 3). It uncovered information to support workplace rehabilitation as a means of delivering improved return to work outcomes for injured workers, as well as to identify the elements of an effective workplace rehabilitation program. This provided a basis for comparison between literature on workplace rehabilitation and what was in practice in NSW coal mines. To assess the operation of workplace rehabilitation in NSW coal mines (research question 4), a survey by questionnaire and interviews of stakeholders participating in its operation was conducted. This provided an understanding of how the  hybrid model worked in practice and insight into the policy process, especially factors impacting on implementation.Next, a workplace rehabilitation audit was developed and trialed in six coal mines over a two year period to assess whether such a tool could improve the operation of workplace rehabilitation (research question 5). The trial provided additional information about workplace rehabilitation thereby adding to its knowledge base. It also provided  information about the implementation of policy into operational settings and how it might be made more successful.Finally, all results from the policy analysis were reviewed to determine what set of recommendations might be made for: the workplace rehabilitation policy framework for NSW coal mines; improving the management of workplace rehabilitation in NSW coal mines; and for the conduct of future research (research question 6). In short, why a hybrid model for workplace rehabilitation was implemented in NSW coal mines instead of the recommended policy framework occurred for a number of reasons. Firstly, key stakeholders, CMI, Employers and Unions, were not represented in high level government policy making mechanisms for workplace rehabilitation policy. This made it difficult for them to participate in the  development of policy principles which would later apply to them. As a result, they did not fully comprehend the new arrangements and how they might interact with workers&#8217; compensation arrangements in place for NSW coal mines. Secondly, key stakeholders, particularly the Unions, were able to influence parliamentary processes to exclude their constituency from legislated elements of the recommended policy framework. Thirdly, key stakeholders including CMI, the Unions and to some extent Employers continued to operate under the old paradigm for workers&#8217; compensation, that is, as a means of providing financial recompense in the event of an injury rather than as a means of providing workplace rehabilitation and return to work. This militated against acceptance of workplace rehabilitation as an integral component of workers&#8217; compensation arrangements. Fourthly, the differences between the hybrid model and the recommended policy framework for workplace rehabilitation were not recognised. Subsequently, implementation of the hybrid model was not altered to account for these differences and therefore achievement of original policy objectives was limited. These factors restricted the integration of workplace rehabilitation into workers&#8217; compensation arrangements in NSW coal mines.Through this research, an in-depth  understanding of the development and operation of workplace rehabilitation policy in NSW coal mines in the period under review was gained. Factors that influenced the  development of public policy were identified thereby contributing to the theoretical  understanding of the policy process. Factors relevant to the operation of workplace rehabilitation policy were also uncovered and a method of improving the delivery of workplace rehabilitation programs was tested which provided important insights into policy implementation. The trial of the workplace rehabilitation audit demonstrated that using such a tool, specifically designed for NSW coal mines, could facilitate policy implementation thereby aiding achievement of original policy objectives. This thesis therefore informed policy theory and practice in an attempt to contribute to the further understanding of workplace  rehabilitation and its ability to improve occupational health outcomes for injured coal miners.1 Hill Michael, The Policy Process in the Modern State, 3rd Edition, Prentice-Hall, Sydney, 1997</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/115</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of over reinforced HSC helically confined beams</field><field name="creator">Elbasha, Nuri Mohamed</field><field name="description">The technology of high strength concrete and high strength steel have improved over the last decade although high strength concrete is still more brittle than normal strength concrete. As this brittleness increases, particularly with the use of over reinforced sections, they may, suddenly fail without any warning.The research reported in this thesis deals with the installation of helical confinement in the compression zone of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams. This study is divided into three parts as follows:1) State of the Art &amp; Literature Review This part deals with state of the art and literature review. Helical confinement is more effective than rectangular ties, compression longitudinal reinforcement and steel fibres in increasing the strength and ductility of confined concrete. Helical reinforcement upon loading increases the ductility and compressive strength of axially loaded concrete due to resistance to lateral expansion caused by Poisson&#8217;s effect. Based on this concept helical reinforcement could be used in the compression zone of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams. The effectiveness of helical confinement depends on different important variables such as helical pitch and diameter. Thus there is a need for an experimental programme VI to prove that installing helical confinement in the compression zone of an overreinforced concrete beam enhances its strength and ductility and to study the behaviour of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams subjected to different variables.2) The Experimental Programme &amp; Test Analysis This part deals with an experimental programme and analysis of test results. Extensive experimental work was done because the beams should be full size in order to accurately represent real beams. Twenty reinforced concrete beams, 4 m long &#61655;&#61472;200 mm wide &#61655;&#61472;300 mm deep were helically confined in the compression zone and then tested in the civil engineering laboratory at the University of Wollongong. In this programme the following areas were studied: the effect of helical pitch, helical diameter, concrete compressive strength and longitudinal reinforcement ratio, on the behaviour of over-reinforced HSC helically confined beams.3) Analytical Models to Predict the Strength &amp; Ductility This part deals with the analytical models used to predict the strength and ductility of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams based on the findings of this study. A comparison between the experimental and predicted results shows an acceptable agreement. This study concludes that helical reinforcement is an effective method for increasing the strength and ductility of over-reinforced high strength concrete beams.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/137</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing reef fish assemblages in a temperate marine park using baited remote underwater video</field><field name="creator">Wraith, James A</field><field name="description">Baited remote underwater video (BRUV) is becoming an increasing popular tool for examining reef fish assemblages in depths less than 100m.  This sampling technique is relatively new in the literature and several gaps remain to be filled.  Scientists using this technique have selected bait based on results from trapping experiments.  Therefore the first objective of the study was to compare commonly used baits and test if different fish species and fish assemblages were recorded.  I planned to apply results from the first study towards further research using BRUV.  Management at Jervis Bay Marine Park, located in southeast Australia, have applied a strategy to protect a comprehensive and representative sample of local habitats and associated flora and fauna.  In doing so, sanctuary &#8220;no take&#8221; zones have been put in place.  Surprisingly, there are no patch reefs afforded this protection.  My second objective was to provide the Jervis Bay Marine Park management with baseline data on deep patch reef locations and to draw comparisons between deep patch, deep coastal, and shallow coastal reefs.  I compared three different baits (pilchard, abalone, and urchin) at three locations in two separate years.  A total of 63 &#8220;drops&#8221; (30 min recordings) were conducted in two years and a total of 47 species were recorded.  There were no differences in the diversity and abundance of fish recorded while baited with pilchard and abalone.  In contrast, in the second year of sampling I detected a greater species richness and abundance using pilchard, compared to urchin, at most locations (p&lt;0.05).  The two most speciose families recorded in the study were Labridae and Monacanthidae.  These families, as well as several individual fish species, were examined but there were no significant differences in their relative abundance among bait treatments.  Additionally, in the second year of sampling I detected differences in H&#8242; and time of first arrival among locations (p&lt;0.05).  Surprisingly, large differences between the baits were greatly reduced at one location - Plantation Point.  I interpret this finding as there being a high density of fish at Plantation Point that masks the differences in the attraction of these baits.  I concluded that as the behaviour and structure of the fish assemblage can vary in space, pilchard was the best choice of bait for consistently detecting species richness and abundance.  A total of 144 BRUV &#8220;drops&#8221; (30 min recordings) in 9 locations in 2005 and 2006 were completed in the second study.  The composition of fish assemblage at shallow and deep water habitats was different (p&lt;0.05).  Indeed, depth related differences for temperate reef fish are well documented and my findings emphasise the need for the Marine Park management to maintain protection of reef habitats across abroad range of depths.  I did not detect any differences in the composition of the fish assemblage or the relative abundance of fish between the two deep habitats (p&gt;0.05), although the presence of several rarely encountered species including Bodianus unimaculatus, Coris sandageri, Meuschenia scaber, Caesioperca lepidoptera, and Eubalichthys mosaicus were recorded in the deep patch reef habitat.  I concluded that the inclusion of the deep habitat in the sanctuary zoning plan is important for protecting fish biodiversity.  By generating permanent baseline data, this study aims to assist Marine Park management in making sound decisions on future zoning plans.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/12</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries</field><field name="creator">Yao, Yueping</field><field name="description">A systematic investigation of carbon based anode materials has been made in this Master&#8217;s thesis project. The physical, structural and electrochemical properties of these anode materials have been characterized by a variety of techniques. A literature review summarizes the principles of lithium-ion battery operation, cathode materials, anode materials and electrolytes. Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, using nanocrystalline iron powders as the catalyst. The diameter of the as-prepared MWNTs is about 20-50nm. Electrochemical testing shows that the MWNT electrodes had a reversible lithium storage capacity of 340-350mAh/g. The kinetics of Li-ion insertion in carbon nanotube electrodes were characterized by a.c. impedance measurements. The electrochemical properties of graphitized mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode materials were studied. SEM observation shows that MCMB agglomerates have a spherical shape with an average particle size of 13?m. Cyclic voltammetry measurements demonstrated a pair of redox peaks, corresponding to lithium insertion and extraction in the MCMB structure. MCMB anodes delivered a reversible capacity of ~325mAh/g with good cyclability. In order to improve the capacity of bare graphite, Sn-coated graphite composites were prepared by using electroless deposition. Cyclic voltammograms show additional redox reaction peaks, which are related to the reaction of Sn with lithium. Sn-graphite composites demonstrated a much higher lithium storage capacity than the bare graphite electrode. Since MCMB anode materials are very stable for lithium-ion insertion and extraction, Sn-coated MCMB composites were developed by combining the high lithium storage, elemental Sn and MCMB to obtain stable cyclability. The Sn-MCMB electrodes show improved capacity and good cyclability within a 15wt% loading of Sn.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/25</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Government-initiated community website schemes: what can we learn from the implementation of an Australian model?</field><field name="creator">Norris, Alison E</field><field name="description">As the Internet has become integral to our daily lives, many community websites have been developed in an attempt to create &#8216;community&#8217; online and to support traditional communities. These community websites were typically developed on an ad-hoc basis. In 2002, the Australian Domain Name Administrators responded to the lack of government-initiated, structured community website schemes by establishing the Community Geographic Domain Name (CGDN) Scheme. This Scheme created new domain names, solely for the use of community groups with the purpose of building community websites. Before gaining access to a CGDN, a community group must demonstrate their links to the community and meet numerous conditions. To date, there has been limited research into the issues that affect government-initiated, structured community website schemes, and no studies have compared the experiences of multiple community websites developed under such schemes to identify factors that affect the viability of these websites and the schemes as a whole. This thesis aims to develop a deeper understanding of the issues associated with government-initiated, structured community website schemes, using an instance of such schemes: the CGDN Scheme. Using a case study approach, an analysis of the CGDN Scheme, and its viability, is completed. Through case studies of the three communities participating in the trial of the CGDN Scheme (Wollongong, New South Wales; Bathurst, New South Wales; and Ballarat, Victoria), rich qualitative data is collected from a variety of data sources about the experiences of the case study participants. Qualitative data is also collected from and about the CGDN management bodies and the CGDN Policy. Based on this data, issues faced by these case studies and by the CGDN Scheme management bodies are identified and their implications discussed. To consolidate the findings of the case studies in a format that is easy for communities to manage and apply, the relationships between these issues are modelled, and the issues are grouped into eight categories: auDA and auCD, Policy, CGDN Project leadership, Publicity and advertising, Community involvement, Finance, Community Website Group and Infrastructure. These issues and factors are mapped using four models. A comparison of approaches chosen by the three test cases allows the implications of such decisions to be considered, and recommendations to improve the viability of the CGDN - iii - Scheme are provided. Finally, recommendations for the establishment of governmentinitiated, structured community website schemes are presented. These recommendations provide a summary of the contribution that this thesis makes to a deeper understanding of government-initiated, structured community website schemes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/32</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial literacy among university students: an Australian case study</field><field name="creator">Bird, Sonia</field><field name="description">Financial literacy has been defined by the National Foundation for Education Research as &#8216;the ability to make informed judgments and to take effective decisions regarding the use and management of money&#8217; (Noctor, Stoney and Stradling, 1992, p. 4). This study investigates the financial literacy levels of Australian university students, using students studying at the University of Wollongong (UOW) as a case study.An online financial literacy survey was distributed to all UOW students and was designed to collect extensive details regarding study characteristics, demographic characteristics, attitudes and perceptions, as well as testing knowledge and skills across a range of specific areas of financial literacy. In addition, the survey enabled a comparison between student&#8217;s own perceptions of their knowledge and/or skills and their actual demonstrated level of knowledge and/or skills.From the survey results, it is concluded that while Australian university students have a satisfactory level of general financial literacy, there are particular areas where they scored low which need to be addressed. It is also found that low financial literacy is associated with students with certain demographic characteristics.This research is extensive in both length and scope and attempted to fill in gaps in the current literature.

Protease trapping induces &#945;2M to adopt an activated conformation which exposes a binding site for the low density lipoprotein receptor (LRP), facilitating clearance of the complexes from the body. &#945;2M has been ascribed many biological roles which extend beyond simple protease inhibition including immune regulation, mediation of the inflammatory response via cytokine binding and more recently chaperone activity. &#945;2M has been shown to inhibit the heat-induced precipitation of proteins in vitro through the formation of stable complexes. The work outlined in this study further characterises the chaperone activity of &#945;2M under conditions of heat and oxidative stress and establishes the relationship between this and its role as a protease inhibitor. When present at physiological concentrations, &#945;2M was found to inhibit the oxidation-induced precipitation of lysozyme (lys). In a preliminary study, it was shown that &#945;2M forms stable, soluble complexes with heat-stressed proteins. In the current study, native agarose gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation analyses were used to demonstrate that &#945;2M also forms stable, soluble complexes with oxidised proteins. Removal of &#945;2M from human plasma was found to significantly increase the level of plasma protein precipitation under conditions of heat and oxidative stress. Proteins co-purifying with &#945;2M from human plasma (following incubation at either 43 &#176;C or room temperature for 72 h) were analysed by mass spectrometry; this identified fibrinogen as a putative endogenous chaperone client protein of &#945;2M. It was also shown that protease-mediated activation of &#61537;2M abolishes the chaperone activity, but that native &#61537;2M is able to form soluble complexes with heat stressed proteins and then subsequently become activated by protease trapping. Oxidation of (chaperone-inactive) protease bound &#945;2M was shown to restore chaperone activity but not the protease inhibitor function.  These behaviours provide an alternative means for generating &#61537;2M/stressed protein/protease complexes which could be cleared in vivo by LRP-mediated cellular uptake and degradation.The ability of &#945;2M/stressed protein complexes to bind to cell surface receptors was investigated using JEG-3, Hep-G2, and U937 cell lines and granulocytes derived from whole human blood. &#945;2M/CS complexes had limited ability to bind to LRP expressed on the surface of JEG-3 cells. However, preliminary results indicated that activation of &#945;2M (&#945;2M*) and &#945;2M/stressed protein complexes (&#945;2M*/CS) with trypsin resulted in subsequent binding to the surface of JEG-3 cells. Native &#945;2M/CS complexes were found to bind to granulocytes and Hep-G2 cells via unidentified, non-LRP receptors. Collectively, the results presented here further establish &#945;2M as a potent extracellular chaperone with the ability to protect proteins from heat and oxidation-induced stress. &#945;2M appears likely to have a dual role in vivo, as a protease inhibitor and as an extracellular chaperone, the first identified mammalian protein with both activities. The evidence suggests that it may function as part of an extracellular quality control system for protein folding important in the control of inflammation and protein conformational disorders (PCDs) such as Alzheimer's disease and type II diabetes. The pathology of PCDs has been linked to the development of extracellular deposits of misfolded proteins. This thesis provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that &#945;2M binds to misfolded extracellular proteins to keep them soluble and mediates their cellular uptake and subsequent degradation. Future advances in understanding of extracellular protein folding quality control are likely to provide novel insights into the mechanisms underpinning the development of serious human diseases and identify opportunities for the development of new therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/114</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming perceptions of Islamic culture in Australia through collaboration in contemporary art</field><field name="creator">Tzavaras, Annette</field><field name="description">My creative work investigates the negative space, the &#8216;in between space&#8217; that leads to new knowledge about other artists and other cultures.

The concept seeks to address both conservation and natural resource (eg. fisheries) management, and in Australia, the introduction of MPAs is guided by comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) principles. At a local scale however, we face the challenge of identifying areas that collectively fulfil the goals of MPAs when we don&#8217;t have enough ecological information. This is due to in part to limited knowledge, but is also a result of poor translation of knowledge into the applied realm of management. Consequently, effective MPAs are difficult to plan and balance against diverse stakeholder needs in a political climate. Therefore, it is recognised that ecological science must play an integral part in the development of effective MPAs. In this study, I used MPA zoning in NSW, Australia, as a large scale experiment, to test the effect of no-take zone protection in tidal flat habitat, and also to assess whether the conservation management decisions achieved the MPA goal of representativeness for tidal flat habitat. As bait-harvesting practices for the crustacean Trypaea australiensis (callinassidae) would cease following the zoning of a marine protected area, I sought to address four key aims. First, to describe relevant spatial patterns of tidal flat biodiversity, to assess the representativeness of the tidal flat in a bioregional context, to determine what the impact of bait harvesting was as a structuring process, and finally to determine the effectiveness of no-take zoning for tidal flat habitat and the potential for recovery of the assemblage. I used a hierarchy of spatially nested scales to sample and test the spatial patterns of tidal flat faunal assemblages, and to determine if the macrofaunal diversity of the protected tidal flat was representative of other tidal flats in the bioregion. This study documents the first recovery trajectory for tidal flat assemblages in a marine protected area. There was an increase in abundance and homogeneity of smaller, less mobile, suspension and deposit feeding species. In contrast, some of the more mobile, predatory and or scavenging species decreased in abundance. This assemblage shift has the potential for further trophic or functional effects beyond the boundaries of the tidal flat, which are discussed, and thus provides important guidance for future research. I also found that macrofaunal assemblages were patchily distributed, being most heterogeneous at the scale of 100s m within the tidal flat. For planning and management this implies that whole habitat is required in no-take zones, in order to encompass the full range of macrofaunal diversity in the habitat. In addition to the key findings, the methods used in this study extended asymmetrical ANOVA to incorporate temporally and spatially asymmetrical factors simultaneously. This extension increases the power and thereby the sensitivity of univariate analysis, to detect environmental change for MPA or impact studies. In addition, data manipulations (taxonomic resolution, assemblage sub-sets and data transformations) demonstrated some dramatic effects on the interpretation of biological pattern. This study demonstrate the opportunity of using MPA management decisions as a basis on which to test ecological predictions, as well as provide outcomes that can be applied to adaptive planning and management for MPA goals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/123</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Busy doing nothing: researching the phenomenon of "quiet time" in a challenge-based wilderness therapy program</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, Valerie E</field><field name="description">Wilderness therapy programs are increasingly regarded as an effective alternative to more traditional forms of therapy for people identified as  &#8216;at risk&#8217; or &#8216;vulnerable&#8217; (Gass, 1993). Despite substantial evidence to support the use of wilderness and adventure experiences to promote attitudinal and behavioural change, much remains unknown about the process of change and the experiences of participants. The purpose of the research was to generate a grounded theory about participants&#8217; experiences of Quiet Time within a challenge-based wilderness therapy program. The central question to be addressed was: What is the phenomenon of Quiet Time from the participants&#8217; point of view and how do they use this phenomenon in a challenge-based wilderness therapy program?  A grounded theory design (Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998) was chosen as a methodology to guide the collection, analysis and interpretation of data. Sixteen male and two female participants from four Mountain Challenge wilderness therapy programs scheduled between February 2002 and February 2005 participated in the study. All but one of the participants came to the Mountain Challenge as part of ongoing therapy for drug and/or alcohol addiction. This triggered significant and particular ethical concerns that impacted on the design of the study. The exception was a female trainee facilitator who participated as all other participants and had no facilitative responsibilities.  Data were collected in the form of interviews, photographs, journals, field notes and standard program documentation. An analytical framework using inductive and deductive categories was selected to analyse the data.Based on the findings a theoretical model of the phenomenon of Quiet Time was deduced and a number of propositions for practice and research advanced. The research findings identify Quiet Time as a &#8216;sense&#8217; of solitude that, contrary to understandings of solitude as an objective and external condition, is defined by the four co-occurring subjective and internal conditions: a sense of being alone; a positive mind frame; a personal time perspective and focussed attention. Further analysis led to an understanding that Quiet Time was typically brief, participant initiated, and inclusive of experiences of &#8220;being alone together.&#8221; Participants utilised Quiet Time as an opportunity to focus on nature, reflect, and to engage in authentic and heartfelt conversation. The outcomes of Quiet Time were found to impact positively on participants&#8217; immediate experience and processing of the wilderness therapy program. The study also indicates that the incidence and use of Quiet Time may be facilitated or constrained by a number of conditions including environmental factors, leadership styles, levels of group development and the individual needs, strengths and limitations of the participant. Among a number of outcomes found to extend beyond the duration of the program was, for some, the taking up of a habit of Quiet Time as a deliberate self-help and life enhancing strategy. Unexpected findings included the potential for Quiet Time to arouse feelings that may overwhelm and confuse participants.One of the major contributions of the study is that it identifies Quiet Time as a commonly occurring, and predominately participant initiated phenomenon that has, despite its capacity to impact positively on participants&#8217; attitudes and behaviours, been largely over looked by the wilderness therapy literature. Quiet Time was found to differ from traditional concepts of solitude in wilderness programs in terms of its duration, how it is defined and how it is initiated. Despite its brevity the outcomes of Quiet Time parallel positive outcomes documented elsewhere. The main implication from this research is that the therapeutic potential of challenge-based wilderness therapy programs can be enhanced by promoting the opportunity for participant initiated Quiet Time through the adoption of an unhurried and process oriented approach to the wilderness adventure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/132</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface reactions of zinc vapour with steel relevant to the Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si hot dip metal coating process</field><field name="creator">Williams, Joseph James</field><field name="description">Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coated steel strip is manufactured by the continuous hot dipping process. An important difference in the processing of Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coated steel when compared with galvanised steel is the higher temperature of the molten alloy bath &#8211;600&#186;C for Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si coatings versus 450&#186;C for galvanised. This increase in temperature leads to an accelerated rate of evaporation of zinc into the pretreatment furnace, leading in turn to various processing difficulties. Zinc vapour in the pre-treatment furnace has long been implicated with defects known within the industry as pinholes and bare patches - uncoated areas where wetting does not occur between the strip and the molten alloy. Despite the association with zinc vapour, the exact mechanisms of pinhole and bare patch formation have not been clearly established. One possible mechanism of pinhole and bare patch formation is the direct reaction of zinc vapour with the strip surface. It has been suggested by industry experts that zinc vapour could condense on the strip, leaving a deposit that prevents wetting by molten Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si alloy. It remains that little is understood of the fundamental nature of the interaction between zinc vapour and a steel substrate. The purpose of this research was to examine the rates and mechanisms of zinc vapour condensation on clean and oxidised steel substrates. Such information is essential for understanding the reactions that occur in the metal coating line furnace. It is intended that this research will strengthen the fundamental knowledge base upon which a solution to the problem can be developed. The experimental work conducted in this study was centred on condensing zinc vapour onto substrates under specific gaseous atmospheres at atmospheric pressure. A major part of the work involved the development of a technique for depositing zinc vapour onto a steel substrate and the design and construction of an experimental apparatus. Preliminary studies were undertaken to define the design criteria for an apparatus in which the rate of condensation of zinc vapour could be measured accurately and the interaction between zinc vapour and clean and oxidised steel substrates could be examined. In this probing exercise, modifications were made to a proven design of an apparatus designed to measure evaporation rates of metals in inert gas atmospheres was used. The preliminary experiments provided a wealth of essential knowledge required to design an experimental facility in which it was possible to accurately measure the rate of condensation of zinc vapour and to study the interaction between zinc vapour and the steel substrate, as well as their potential chemical reactions. This new apparatus was specifically developed for a quantitative assessment of zinc vapour deposition, and allowed the substrate and zinc vapour to be heated in independent, but interconnecting chambers. The exposure of the substrate to the zinc vapour could be controlled with precision, and it was possible to not only measure the zinc vapour condensation rates, but also to assess the effect of using oxidising and reducing gasses during preheating of the substrate. Under conditions of high undercooling, zinc vapour deposited by the island plus continuous thin film mode, while at higher substrate temperatures, close to that expected in the industrial process, the zinc deposited more slowly, and zinc islands did not form on the substrate within the first 60 seconds of exposure. Deposition of zinc vapour on an oxidised substrate occurred at a much higher rate than on a clean steel substrate. This increase in deposition rate has been attributed to a direct reaction occurring between the zinc vapour and the iron oxide without the formation of any liquid condensate. The reaction is: Fe3O4(s) + 4Zn(v) &#8596; 4ZnO(s) + 3Fe(s) This reaction will proceed to the right under sufficiently high partial pressures of zinc vapour, and at substrate temperatures both above and below the saturation temperature of the zinc vapour. It was observed that under sufficiently low partial pressures of zinc vapour, the above reaction is driven to the left. Zinc oxide has a determining influence on the wetting of the strip by the molten alloy. Immersion tests, wherein substrates deposited with zinc vapour were dipped into molten Zn-55%Al-1.5%Si alloy, were carried out to examine the effect of various zinc vapour reactions on the quality of the coatings. Deposition of zinc vapour on both clean and oxidised steel surfaces had a detrimental effect on the coating quality. In cases where zinc was deposited onto a clean steel substrate prior to immersion in the coating alloy, pinholes resulted, while zinc vapour deposition on an oxidised surface prior to immersion led to large scale uncoated areas.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/395</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital film dosimetry in radiotherapy and the development of analytical applications software</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yang</field><field name="description">This study is focused on the analysis, evaluation and calibration of low cost computer desktop scanners for possible use in film dosimetry.

It is a member of the small heat shock protein family (sHsp) and acts as a molecular chaperone by stabilizing proteins under stress conditions through the formation of a soluble sHsp target protein complex to prevent their aggregation.Macromolecular crowding is ubiquitous in all types of cells and describes the normal conditions inside a cell. The concentration of macromolecules inside a cell is very high (up to 300 mg/mL) arising from species such as polysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids and therefore it greatly promotes the self-assembly of proteins. Thus, there is a major difference between in vivo and in vitro conditions such as those used in most studies of protein behaviour and properties.Appropriate destabilizing conditions (i.e. heating or reduction) cause damage and misfolding of proteins, which as a result expose previously buried hydrophobic regions. Hydrophobic interactions of nearby molecules cause selfassociation and aggregate formation. Aggregation of intermediately folded peptide or protein molecules also leads to the formation of amyloid fibrils, highly-ordered &#946;-sheet structures associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#8217;s, Parkinson&#8217;s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases.In vitro, much work has been published on the interactions of &#945;-crystallin with target proteins in dilute solutions. In order to better understand the chaperone activity of &#945;-crystallin under conditions more closely resembling the intracellular environment, its interaction with a range of destabilized proteins (ovotransferrin, &#946;L-crystallin, insulin, &#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;s- and &#954;-casein) in the presence of dextran (68 kDa) have been examined using visible absorption spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, ANS binding, TEM, HPLC and NMR spectroscopy studies.In the presence of dextran, the rate and extent of aggregation of reduced ovotransferrin, insulin, &#945;-lactalbumin and &#946;L-crystallin was accelerated. Under these conditions, &#945;-crystallin was less effective in preventing aggregation and precipitation of target proteins. It is proposed that a kinetic competition exists between aggregation of target proteins and the chaperone action of &#945;-crystallin which supports the hypothesis that &#945;-crystallin interacts more effectively with slowly aggregating rather than rapidly aggregating target proteins.Amyloid fibril formation by &#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;s- and &#954;-casein was verified by a sigmoidal increase in Thioflavin T fluorescence over time. &#945;-Crystallin prevented amyloid formation in &#945;s- and &#954;-casein. In the presence of dextran, the rate of amyloid formation by &#945;-lactalbumin, &#945;s- and &#954;-casein was enhanced. Under these conditions, &#945;-crystallin was less effective in preventing amyloid formation of &#954;-casein and this was supported by TEM, CD, NMR spectroscopy and HPLC studies.Subunit exchange is an important feature of sHsp chaperone action. This study found that subunit exchange of &#945;A-crystallin increased with increasing temperature and decreased as a result of interaction with reduced ovotransferrin. It was further demonstrated that the presence of the dextran markedly reduced the rate of subunit exchange of &#945;A-crystallin and with increasing temperature, this effect was exacerbated. Moreover, in the presence of reduced ovotransferrin, dextran further slowed the subunit exchange of &#945;Acrystallin.Aggregation of &#946;-lactoglobulin occurs mainly via intermolecular disulphide bond exchange. Upon heating, &#946;-lactoglobulin aggregated which increased with increasing pH. The presence of dextran or DTT led to more rapid aggregation and precipitation of &#946;-lactoglobulin. &#945;-Crystallin prevented the aggregation of heat-stressed &#946;-lactoglobulin and was a more efficient chaperone at higher pH values. In the presence of DTT, however, &#945;-crystallin was a less efficient chaperone due to faster aggregation of heated and reduced &#946;-lactoglobulin.In order to obtain further structural and functional information on the C-terminal extension, &#945;-crystallin from dogfish (Squalus acanthias) was studied to allow comparisons with bovine &#945;-crystallin to be made. Chaperone assays under heat and reduction stresses as well as NMR spectroscopy showed that the Cterminal extension of dogfish &#945;-crystallin was very flexible and had a similar structure and function to that of bovine &#945;-crystallin. Its chaperone action under heat stress was found to be comparable to bovine &#945;-crystallin but it was a better chaperone under reduction stress.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/525</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An appropriate manufacturing strategy model for the Thai food processing industry</field><field name="creator">Pongpattanasili, Chaitamlong</field><field name="description">Thailand is well recognised for its high potential as an agricultural country and major food supplier. It provides a major source of agricultural product and agricultural manufacturing based industries. The most important sector is the food processing industry. This area is the most important sub-sector in Thai industry. The value in exports in the year 2002 was approximately 14.4% of the country&#8217;s total GDP. However, a high potential for growth still exists.Food production in Thailand is based on local agricultural raw materials, comprising of fruit and vegetables, cereal and oils, fish and livestock and provides employment to 20 million people within the agricultural and food processing sector. This thesis discusses the characteristics of the Thai food processing industry and suggests an appropriate manufacturing strategy model is needed in order for it to achieve manufacturing excellence.This study presents a classification of the Thai agricultural industry and compares one of its sectors, the agricultural manufacturing industry with another industrial sector viz. the electrical/electronic industry. The thesis investigates both industries contribution and reveals why the food processing industry is important for Thailand. After an overall analysis of the industry and its importance, the results of a survey of 350 food processing companies are compared, including characteristics of the Thai food processing industry, the focus of manufacturing strategies and the implementation of manufacturing practices.Based on this, and in order to assist the Thai food processing industry to achieve manufacturing excellence, the thesis then develops an integrated model combining GMP, HACCP, TPM and TQM, and provides guideline for their implementation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/576</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a spatial technical writing technique: the application of concept mapping and sentence diagramming</field><field name="creator">Ha, Hung Manh</field><field name="description">In today&#8217;s era of dynamic information technology, technical documents are becoming bigger and are updated more frequently than ever before. As a result, people have to spend a huge amount of time and efforts to digest these technical documents. At present, traditional technical writing uses word-after-word narrative writing to produce technical documents. The resulting narrative document often has language ambiguity and an inefficient concept manipulation problem which can cause a lot of difficulty for readers. In this thesis, it is proposed that concept mapping and sentence diagramming are two techniques that have the potential to effectively solve the inefficient concept manipulation and the structural language ambiguity problems of natural language narrative. The purpose of this research is therefore to offer a solution to the language ambiguity and inefficient concept manipulation problem existing in the traditional narrative technical documents. Specifically, it seeks to answer the question: is it possible to create a new technical writing technique that has its structure similar to the sentence diagramming technique, but is simpler for readers to understand, and can help readers to efficiently manipulate concepts in a text in a manner similar to that of a concept map? A developmental research method approach was adopted. The research was conducted in two phrases. The first phrase was to develop a new and more effective technical writing technique called &#8216;spatial technical writing&#8217; (STW) based on concept mapping and sentence diagramming techniques. The second phrase was to conduct a small exploratory study using students to compare the STW technique with traditional x narrative. The exploratory study used a small pilot experiment with basic quantitative and qualitative measurements. The quantitative result showed that students achieved a slightly higher mark on comprehension of the narrative text test than the spatial text test. The probability analysis showed that the pilot experiment was not significant. The qualitative result revealed that the main reason that students did not do as well on the spatial text test was because they did not thoroughly understand the STW symbols used in the pilot experiment. Due to the lack of an experimental budget; the pilot experiment couldn&#8217;t test all STW symbols, and the students didn&#8217;t receive enough training to understand STW sufficiently. These two confounding variables distorted the pilot experiment and made the results of pilot experiment inconclusive. However there was enough encouragement to continue the research. The result of this pilot experiment will be used to refine the STW technique, and to plan a full-scale experiment in the future. Finally, the implication of this research is that; if the Internet based STW software is developed, it can help people to digest technical knowledge in ashorter time and with less effort than traditional narrative.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/577</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protection of women's rights in Bangladesh : a legal study in an international and comparative perspective</field><field name="creator">Begum, Afroza</field><field name="description">Women&#8217;s legal rights are one of the most significant determinants of their status. In Bangladesh, a series of laws ensuring women&#8217;s rights have proven largely ineffective in promoting their positions. The prime reasons for this are: the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of laws, women&#8217;s inability to access legal proceedings, the traditional and cultural negative views about women&#8217;s rights, the absence of an accountable and transparent government, the expensive and time consuming judicial process, the lack of an efficient judiciary, and other socio-ecomic reasons. The core theme of the thesis concentrates on the shortcomings and ineffectiveness of laws, although viewing them within the context of those other factors. To signify the &#8216;ineffectiveness of laws&#8217;, emphasis is basically placed on the administrative and judicial approaches in the country to achieve the underlying objectives of law concerning women&#8217;s rights in pertinent areas. This study aims to promote protection of women&#8217;s rights by recommending remedies to flaws in prevailing laws in Bangladesh in four areas. Recommendations are made by reference to comparative and international practices. The primary arguments developed and maintained throughout the thesis are: (i) the protection of women&#8217;s rights is imperative to improve their status and law is an essential instrument to ensure these rights; (ii) the legislative, administrative and judicial efforts in Bangladesh are not appropriate and conducive to dealing with women&#8217;s rights; and (iii improvements in those efforts can better protect women&#8217;s rights. This study critically examines laws regarding women&#8217;s employment and political participation and the laws on dowry and rape. It also explores the ways laws have been structured and enforced in Bangladesh, and how law can be an effective means of women&#8217;s pursuit of rights. In so doing, this thesis analyses and compares a range of legislation and judicial decisions of a number of selected common law jurisdictions. Findings of the research demonstrate that the legal efforts of those countries resulted in significant improvements in traditional laws and enforcement procedures regarding employment, dowry as a form of domestic violence, and rape.Conversely, in Bangladesh, the age-old common-law grown formalities continue to dominate the legal and judicial proceedings and therefore fail to provide remedies to the contemporary needs of women. The present legal regime also suffers from an important flaw with regard to the scope and extent of liabilities for the violation of laws designed to protect women&#8217;s equal and special rights. The absence of any independent administrative body to monitor the compliance of laws presents another serious flaw in the current legal regime of the country. Such shortcomings eventually encourage and favour the wrongdoer, worsening the vulnerability of already disadvantaged women in the traditional culture of Bangladesh. In responding to such a situation, the present study recommends the reconceptualisation of laws to accommodate women&#8217;s unique experiences in Bangladesh. The study ends with a number of specific recommendations for ensuring women&#8217;s rights through strengthening the legal and enforcement mechanisms in Bangladesh.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/595</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When there is no speech : a case study of the nonverbal multimodal communication of a child with an intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Dreyfus, Shoshana Judith</field><field name="description">This case study uses Systemic Functional theory to describe and analyse the multimodal communication of an eight year-old boy, Bodhi, with both a severe intellectual disability and a severe communication impairment. The study specifically explores the meanings Bodhi makes and the resources he uses instead of speech to make those meanings. The study also examines the underlying system of language Bodhi draws on to make his meanings.The theoretical resources of the Systemic Functional model of language are used to capture both what occurs within Bodhi&#8217;s communicative turns and also what occurs across the turns at the level of discourse semantics. Within the turn, the study uses the theoretical resources of the interpersonal, ideational and textual metafunctions; above the turn, the study uses the resources of Exchange Structure Analysis.The corpus consists of data collected via tape recorder and observation notes. In order to capture the effects of different communication partners on the interactions with Bodhi, data collected via tape recorder consists of two transcripts of Bodhi communicating with different communication partners, his father and his grandmother. Each transcript was segmented into exchanges and moves. These were quantified to expose patterns of communication. Each move was examined for the presence of metafunctional meanings, which were also quantified. The study demonstrates that Bodhi makes meaning in ways that are different to speakers (of English). The findings also show that while he occupies a restricted semiotic space, having what could be construed as a form of protolanguage, Bodhi&#8217;s communication also has features of transition and adult language. The study also shows that while Bodhi is a persistent communicator, intent on getting his meanings across, contributions of the communication partner are crucial for the success of Bodhi&#8217;s meaning making. This success relies on a willingness on the part of the communication partner to work together with Bodhi in the joint negotiation and joint construction of meaning.This study also identifies a lack of research within the field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication that describes the meaning making of ambulant nonverbal multimodal communicators with severe intellectual disabilities.

ICPs can be used in a range of unique applications, and also to replace many metal conductors or inorganic semiconductors. Commercialisation of ICPs has, however, been limited. Ion and solvent transport in ICPs during redox cycling almost universally leads to breakdown of redox activity and desired properties of the material. ILs comprise of neat ions in the form of a room temperature melt. ILs show great promise as novel electrolytes to enhance the stability of ICPs beyond that observed in CEs and paves the way to commercialisation of ICP devices. Chapter 3 describes fundamental investigations of ICP / IL systems on Pt disk electrodes. The redox cycling stability of polypyrrole was increased over those of CE systems in the IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (BMIPF6). The electroactivity in this system showed no degradation over 900 redox cycles. The use of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium (bis) trifluoromethanesulfonimide (EMITFSI) also improved the redox stability of polypyrrole in comparison to the CE systems. The stable potential windows of polypyrrole were significantly improved in both IL systems compared to CEs. The transitional behaviour between ILs and CEs was investigated by diluting ILs in a common neutral solvent electrolyte, propylenecarbonate (PC). In such IL / CE mixtures,differences were noted in the electrolyte conductivity profile and ICP electroactivity with respect to concentration of IL. BMIPF6 exhibited a significantly higher degree of ion pairing than EMITFSI, and the strong ion pairing property of BMIPF6 is thought to be responsible for unique electrochemical observations absent from the ICP in EMITFSI systems. N-doping is an attractive feature of some ICPs and has promise in charge storage applications, providing significant driving potential differences of two or more volts against p-doped electrodes. As ILs were found to enhance redox stability of common pdoping processes in ICPs, investigations were conducted in Chapter 4 to see if the same was true for inherently unstable n-doping processes. Poly-3-p-flourophenylthiophene (P3PFTh) was chosen as a model n-doping system, due to its well published n-doping behaviour in classical electrolytes. Surprisingly, n-doping responses of P3PFTh in EMITFSI were very poor. The reasons behind this were explored by testing other n-dopable polymers in EMITFSI to isolate whether EMITFSI was inherently preventing n-doping, and P3PFTh was tested with different ILs to investigate P3PFTh / EMITFSI incompatibility. EMITFSI used as an electrolyte was found to decrease electroactivity of the n-doping processes in most polythiophenes, with the exception of polybithiophene (PBiTh). The stability of n-doping PBiTh in EMITFSI did not, however, improve to an extent that would allow derivative devices to be practical. Spectroelectrochemical Raman studies of the n-doping processes of polythiophenes in EMITFSI were conducted in-situ to reveal behaviour that may be responsible for poor electrochemical responses. Raman studies showed that both the p-doping and n-doping process in polythiophenes occurred with a &#8216;reverse&#8217; mechanism of ion expulsion upon doping (whereas doping processes of ICPs in CEs usually occur by ion insertion). The Raman studies also indicated that the physical structure of polythiophene had a large effect on the resulting electrochemistry, to an extent that impeded doping processes. The structure-activity relationships of P3PFTh were investigated by CV using a range of growth and cycling electrolytes. Observations were analysed chemometrically to identify the effects on electrochemical parameters of electrolyte component (anion or cation), whether the dominating effect was from growth or cycling electrolyte, and which particular doping / dedoping process was affected by these parameters. Chapter 5 describes electrochemical charge storage devices based on IL electrolytes using various substrates, polymers and configurations. The highest capacity device was based on polyaniline doped with ferrocene sulphonic acid on carbon fibre textile for both anode and cathode, with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) separator and EMITFSI electrolyte. The flexible charge storage device produced in this way had a maximum charge capacity of 58 mAh/g, but degraded quickly on cycling. The most stable device was constructed similarly to the highest capacity device, but used polypyrrole and poly- 3-methylthiophene electrodes, with maximum charge capacity of 17 mAh/g, remaining unchanged for 60 cycles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/766</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolving role of the environmental health officer: maintaining public health in the context of a changing food regulatory environment</field><field name="creator">Grigonis-Deane, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This qualitative study aimed to describe how environmental health officers prioritized different components of food regulation enforcement within the context of their overall workload, to gather information about how to better prepare environmental health officers for the demands of their role.  A significant change in the role of environmental health officers is occurring due to new legislative requirements related to food labelling. In 2003, the Australia and New Zealand Food Regulation Ministerial Council (the Ministerial Council) developed a Policy Guideline on Nutrition, Health and Related Claims (the Policy Guideline), providing a framework for the regulation of nutrition, health and related claims.   Environmental health officers are likely to be responsible for the enforcement of these proposed new regulations.  The proposed monitoring role is as yet untested and the factors influencing the environmental health officers&#8217; decisions about prioritization of work load are unknown.  The priority given to the enforcement of such regulations may impact on how effectively environmental health officers perform this aspect of their work load.   The data used in this study were obtained through semi-structured interviews with 37 environmental health officers from three states, NSW, QLD and ACT.  The sample included male and female officers at both field and senior level across local and state sites.  The interview transcripts were analyzed by thematic coding with the aid of a qualitative software analysis package.   The work and control scales survey data were analyzed using SPSS 15. Results showed that field officers considered themselves to be protectors of the community&#8217;s health, closely interacting with the community and responding to their demands and complaints.  Field officers&#8217; routine inspections and investigation of food poisoning and hygiene complaints were given highest priority, while monitoring health claims on food labels was given low priority.  Conversely, senior officers reported being more involved with management, interacting with outside organizations and politics, and assigned higher priority to the monitoring of health claims on food labels.The analysis of environmental health officers&#8217; work practices and attitudes using the framework of Lipsky&#8217;s (1980) theory of street-level-bureaucracy was used to enhance present understanding of the implications for policy implementation at the interface between the public and government. This study extends existing knowledge about the motivations behind the work practice of environmental health officers, a poorly researched group, and explores their roles within Lipsky&#8217;s framework of street-level bureaucrats.  The study thus extends Lipsky&#8217;s model into a new area of work practice.  Contrary to previous studies indicating street-level bureaucrats use coping mechanisms to decrease frustration caused by work conditions, this study&#8217;s results revealed that the desire to create positive outcomes for the community drove the behaviour of environmental health officers.   Further results from this study indicate that environmental health officers, through their work practices and especially in their enforcement role, have the capacity to optimize or lessen the benefits to consumers of food regulations such as nutrition and health related claims on food labels.   Three major recommendations arise out of this study to ensure that consumers benefit from the new legislation regarding nutrition and health related claims on food labels.  There should be provision of sufficient resources and timely training in new responsibilities for environmental health officers.  Communication between State and local government authorities must continue to be improved and maintained, so that adequate support and appropriate guidance from team leaders is consistently available.  Lastly, increased public education regarding the importance of nutrition, health and related claims as a tool to make healthier food purchases is needed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/817</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sample design and estimation for household surveys</field><field name="creator">Clark, Robert Graham</field><field name="description">Household surveys are a widely-used tool for obtaining information about a population of people.  A sample of households is selected followed by a sample of people within selected households.  Households exhibit structure with variables measured on people in the same household often being dependent.  Household sizes vary significantly and the strength of dependencies within a household may depend on its size.  Traditional sample design and estimation methods ignore these dependencies.Methodologies which explicitly allow for the dependencies which may arise within households are developed in four areas: &#8226;	Estimating the design effects of standard estimators, for survey design; &#8226;	Constructing new estimators to exploit dependencies within households; &#8226;	Selecting a set of auxiliary variables to use in regression estimation; &#8226;	Allocating the sample sizes of households and of people within households.In each case, new methods will be developed which allow for the population structure of people within households.  The new methods will be compared theoretically and numerically to existing methods to show whether, and under what conditions, it is worthwhile explicitly allowing for this population structure.This thesis is concerned with the sampling error of estimators of population totals; that is, the error due to selecting only a sample and not the whole population of people.  The model-assisted framework will be used.The thesis finds that the population structure of people within households can be exploited to give several useful innovations.  It is shown that, in estimating the variance at the sample design stage, the variation of household size must be considered.  This variation is ignored in existing methods for estimating the design effect, and a more accurate method is developed.  It is found that minor improvements can be made to standard estimators of total by considering within-household dependencies.  An &#8220;integrated weighting&#8221; method, based on a linear contextual model, which has important practical advantages is found to often have slightly lower variance than non-integrated methods, contrary to common belief.  Existing criteria for selecting which auxiliary variables to use in regression estimation are extended to the case of two-stage sampling, and applied to household surveys.  In most household surveys, either one person or all people are selected from each selected household.  More general designs, in which the number of people selected is a function of the number of people in the household, are developed.  The fact that the number of people in a household is small leads to some novel and efficient sample designs and estimators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2055</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient behaviour modelling of underground high voltage cable systems</field><field name="creator">Daud, Muhamad Zalani</field><field name="description">The behaviour of voltage and current transients when a high voltage (HV) cable is first energised is a problem of practical significance to utilities. Modelling of this behaviour on a suitable simulation platform is an attractive approach, in many cases, provided that the results closely match real-world behaviour. This thesis presents modelling and analysis of transients resulting from energisation of an unloaded cable using PSCAD&#174;/EMTDC&#8482; simulation software. An assessment of the applicability of existing frequency-dependent (FD) cable models is given. The impact of transients on a simulated cable system is also presented and discussed.In cable system modelling, system components must be accurately modelled, primarily the underground cable. Two common frequency-dependent cable models are based on the travelling wave method, namely the FD-Mode and FD-Phase models. These models are investigated by comparing their ability to predict energisation current transients resulting from the switching of an unloaded 132 kV underground cable. The simulated results are validated by comparison with the measurement data. It was found that, the FD-Phase model provides more accurate results compared to the FD-Mode model. This model is widely applicable and suitable for use in modelling a wide range of frequencies.The FD-Phase model was used in this study to analyse the distribution of overvoltages at sending and receiving ends of the cable system. Specifically, statistical analysis has been carried out correlating the overvoltage magnitudes induced and the closing behaviour of the circuit breaker (CB). Two statistical switching techniques have been applied, namely the deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Based on the approaches studied, results from probabilistic techniques are recommended owing to the fact that it is closer to reality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2032</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location of injury site in chronic low back pain patients: an electromyographic and mechanomyographic analysis</field><field name="creator">Gorelick, Mark</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this thesis was to determine if anatomical injury site in chronic low back (CLBP) patients can be identified by two complementary non-invasive diagnostic techniques, surface electromyography (sEMG) and mechanomyography (MMG). The application of these techniques to injury site identification is based upon the hypothesis that muscle tissues surrounding an injured joint are physiologically distinct from those surrounding &#8220;healthy&#8221; joints. Such changes in muscle physiology, associated with underlying joint pathology, may include alterations in muscle fibre type composition and number with a corresponding change in the muscle&#8217;s speed of contraction and its pattern of neuromotor control. These injury-induced changes in muscle function should be readily detected, at least in superficial muscles, by simple kinesiological techniques such as sEMG and/or MMG. Six experimental studies were conducted to validate the diagnostic tools (sEMG and MMG) and to locate injury site in a total of 73 normal and CLBP subjects and a group of 12 Wistar rats. The results of these studies validated the combined sEMG and MMG techniques and concluded that injury site in diagnosed CLBP patients could be accurately identified to within one vertebral segment of the injured zygapophyseal joint through application of the MMG technique. Importantly, the MMG technique appeared to be more sensitive than the sEMG technique to identify the injury site in CLBP patients. Although the sEMG technique could significantly (p&lt;0.05) differentiate between the CLBP and healthy control groups, it was unable detect specific changes in muscle contractile properties associated with underlying joint pathology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/541</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A heuristic framework for the determination of the critical elements in authentic assessment</field><field name="creator">Ashford-Rowe, Kevin Hugh</field><field name="description">Higher Education is currently undergoing a period of significant challenge and transformation. It is likely that these challenges will, in a comparatively short period of time, lead to changes in the ways in which the higher education experience is both mediated and accessed. These changes have arisen as a result of a number of factors, including the information revolution, and the consequent pace of technological innovation, the increased demand from both employers and government for a more highly skilled workforce and the desire to increase and make more accessible the higher education experience to an increasing proportion of the overall population. All of this has impacted upon the ways in which the higher education experience is represented, and in turn, by which students gain access to the knowledge and skills that will underpin their ability to both learn and perform. Higher education is increasingly being challenged to demonstrate its continued value to the broader community, especially employers, by ensuring that it provides capable, competent and informed citizens adequate to the challenges of a twenty-first century lifetime. If these principles are considered drivers for change, then it is important that the higher education sector can continue to demonstrate its ongoing value to the students who undertake it. It is against this background that this study was developed with the purpose of identifying from the literature, and then to codify into an applicable framework, the critical elements that would determine an assessment as being authentic. The study took as its starting point the importance, in the current educational context, of being able to determine the elements that define an educational experience as being an authentic one. The research commenced with a review of the literature to identify and collate those elements that had been identified by previous researchers in the field. Next these elements, once refined iteratively in practice, were developed into a framework that could be applied by the designer of instruction and assessment, in order to ascertain whether such a framework could be used to support the design of a more authentic assessment experience. This framework was then applied in practice and the student&#8217;s response to the learning and assessment designed according to these elements was evaluated, and the elements were further reviewed and revised upon the basis of this data. Thus the study was conducted in four phases, in the first of which the researcher explored the problem, in the second the researcher sought the development of a solution, and in the third phase this solution was implemented and evaluated, the findings were presented in the final phase. The findings of this study suggest that not only is it possible to codify those elements critical to the determination of authenticity into such a framework, but moreover, it is possible to systematically apply them in the design of assessment activity. Thus the implication of this research for educators and educational designers who seek to meet a requirement for workplace relevance in the design of their education and assessment activities is that they will have a better opportunity to both identify and then apply specific design principles that will assist them in the better development of assessment outcomes with a clearer workplace applicability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/966</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of subjective risk tolerance categorisation methods used by financial advisors: evidence from a psychometric financial risk tolerance questionnaire</field><field name="creator">Subedar, Zaffar</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerance assessment methods. Research in this field is scarce and unequivocal, with little guidance on best practice for professionals in the industry. This research provides empirical evidence on an increasingly important issue, given recent regulatory changes in Australia and abroad. Data used in this thesis is drawn from two sections of a psychometrically validated risk tolerance assessment tool. Prior studies examining issues regarding financial risk tolerance use relatively small samples, students, hypothetical investors or respondents of large-scale surveys that cover several financial and lifestyle aspects of individuals. The data set used in this thesis is advantageous as it overcomes these undesirable characteristics, with the majority of respondents being real investors seeking financial advice. The first issue examined is the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; use of subjective risk tolerance categorisation (heuristic) methods in statistically differentiating categories of risk tolerance. Heuristics are rules of thumb or short cuts used when making complex decisions. The existing literature examining the directional relationships of demographic characteristics to predict an investor&#8217;s risk tolerance provides the basis for selecting Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics. Results, while similar to previous studies, indicate investors can be classified into four and five categories of risk tolerance, as opposed to three in previous research. This finding illustrates that Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics are approximations that are not statistically effective as the level of categorisation increases. The second issue examined compares Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective (heuristic) categorised risk tolerances to an investor&#8217;s actual categorised risk tolerances. Limited prior research demonstrates substantial variation in Financial Advisor&#8217;s interpretation of hypothetical investor statements. Thus, if Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics are effective in categorising an investor&#8217;s risk tolerance, no difference between an investor&#8217;s responses to direct questions and Financial Advisors&#8217; categorised heuristic risk tolerances should exist. To determine if there are differences, various forms of categorisation are used for comparison. Using two sections of a psychometrically validated risk tolerance assessment instrument, Financial Advisors&#8217; categorised heuristic risk tolerances are constructed and compared to investors&#8217; actual responses to direct questions. A statistically significant difference is found between Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective (heuristic) categorised risk tolerances and investors&#8217; actual categorised risk tolerances, consistent under the various forms of categorisation. The third issue examined is the likelihood of an investor having the same categorised subjective risk tolerance as their response to direct risk tolerance questions. Investors&#8217; responses are compared to two measures of subjective categorised risk tolerances using multivariate analysis established in the literature. The two measures are (i) Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerance (as established in chapter four) and, (ii) investors&#8217; self-assessed categorised risk tolerances (as established in chapter three). Results suggest that the type of direct question is an influencing factor in the misclassification of investors&#8217; risk tolerance categorisation. Quantitative direct-type questions result in investors being more risk-tolerant when facing choices that are quantitative, as opposed to qualitative, in nature. Also, as the level of categorisation increases, the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective risk tolerance assessments is reduced. This thesis empirically illustrates three important results regarding the effectiveness of Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerance assessment methods. First, Financial Advisors&#8217; heuristics are not effective as the level of risk tolerance categorisation increases. Second, in comparison to direct objective measures, there is a significant difference between Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective categorised risk tolerances and investors&#8217; responses to direct questions. Third, using different direct question types, Financial Advisors&#8217; subjective methods become ineffective as the level of categorisation increases. Results of this thesis provide Financial Advisors, investors and regulators with an understanding of the complex nature of risk tolerance categorisation. Further, these findings support a move towards formal risk tolerance categorisation procedures that are effective under several levels of categorisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/39</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The status of the greater glider "Petauroides volans" in the Illawarra region</field><field name="creator">Maloney, Kevin S</field><field name="description">Anecdotal evidence suggested that the Greater glider Petauroides volans Kerr 1792 had been eliminated from Royal National Park by wildfires in 1994. This thesis is concerned with the distribution of the Greater glider in the Illawarra region, the reasons why it appears unable to recolonise an area in which it was formerly found, and the potential for re-establishing the former population. The specific aims of this study were to (1) clarify the taxonomy of this species; (2) review the distribution and abundance of Greater gliders in the Illawarra area and the current threats to populations; (3) conduct a detailed field study in the region; and (4) develop a translocation proposal for reintroduction of Greater gliders to Royal National Park.Early accounts of the Greater glider Petauroides volans (Marsupialia: Pseudocheiridae), started with Arthur Phillips&#8217; 1789 account in The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay, but, since then, the species has had a quite peripatetic and confusing taxonomic history. It has been listed as a member of 10 genera, with about 23 different binomial names. The taxonomy and early descriptions of the species&#8217; morphology, dentition, behaviour, distribution and abundance are complex, and P. volans has frequently been confused with a number of other gliding possums, particularly the Yellow-bellied glider, Petaurus australis. Early descriptions of the morphology of P. volans were given only in broad general terms. More value can be placed on the early behavioural observations, and on the earliest records of their occurrence. Recent distribution records of the Greater glider in the study area show that its range and numbers have declined over a 35 year period. Many factors may have contributed to this decline including; removal of habitat and den trees, predators, and the timing and frequency of fire events. The population of Greater gliders that was present at Royal National Park prior to 1994 was depleted by the shooting of 21 individuals between 1978 to 1980. A number of barriers in the landscape will limit the ability of the Greater glider to disperse from adjacent areas back to Royal National Park.My detailed field study, using spotlighting, at 19 sites confirmed that it is no longer present in many areas in which it was once observed. It is present in areas that are conserved as part of Sydney catchment Authority, and is indeed absent from Royal National Park. This information suggests that a reintroduction of the Greater glider to Royal National Park would be worthwhile, particularly as the Greater glider was formerly abundant at Royal National Park.The biological and ecological factors required by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service policy document for the translocation of fauna are considered for the translocation proposal of the Greater glider to Royal National Park. These factors include; the reintroduction of 18 individuals using a sex ratio of 1:2 (6 males and 12 females), at two sites (Jersey Springs and Bola Creek) with three lots of F-M-F at each site (3 males and 6 females). Monitoring of the translocated individuals would use radio collars, reflective tags and spotlighting to determine initial success of the reintroduction. The low population numbers of the Greater glider in the Illawarra region call for sourcing the individuals from other areas. The taxonomy and the current and former range of the Greater glider are reviewed.The Greater glider lives for 10 &#8211; 15 years with adult females having one young per year, with greater success in forests with higher nutrient levels. The species is solitary and virtually silent, with populations ranging from 0.01 to 5 individuals per hectare. It is a hollow dependent, nocturnal folivorous marsupial which feeds high in the canopy and consumes some 33 eucalypt and ten non eucalypt species across its distribution. The home range size for the Greater glider is 1.4 to 2.6 ha for males and 0.8 to 2.5 ha for females. Threats to this species include habitat clearing, logging, fire and predation with ten predators reported. The only disease reported is Chlamydia which appears not to have any effect, while three ectoparasites and eight endoparasites were also recorded for this species. There have been no previous translocation programs undertaken for the Greater glider; other analogous species which have been translocated include the Sugar glider, Koala and Common Brushtail possum.The source population for the translocation of the Greater glider to Royal National Park, should come from an area other than the Illawarra as these populations are in low numbers and are of local conservation priority.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/59</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeoenvironments of the Gulf of Carpentaria from the last glacial maximum to the present, as determined by foraminiferal assemblages</field><field name="creator">Holt, Sabine</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a palaeoenvironmental study of the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, from around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to the present. Foraminifers, microscopic unicellular aquatic organisms, occur throughout the sediment in the time frame studied. Data on the species composition and preservation of the microfossils found in the Gulf of Carpentaria cores are utilised to reconstruct past environments by comparison to the known assemblages of living foraminifers in various modern environments. The Gulf of Carpentaria is a shallow epicontinental sea, situated between Australia and Papua New Guinea, and is a maximum of 70m deep. It is separated from the Pacific Ocean to the east by Torres Strait, which is 12m deep at its shallowest, and from the Indian Ocean and Arafura Sea to the west by the Arafura Sill, which is 53m below sea-level (bpsl) at its shallowest. For at least ten thousand years in the lead up to the LGM (which reached its peak about twenty thousand years ago), and for about ten thousand years after, sea levels were lower than the 53m-deep Arafura Sill. The continental shelf in the Gulf of Carpentaria area between Australia and Papua New Guinea was exposed, creating a land bridge between the two islands, and a lake developed in the Carpentaria Basin. This palaeolake is termed Lake Carpentaria (named by Torgersen et al., 1983). Documentation of the timing in fluctuations in the extent and salinity of Lake Carpentaria provides information on local and regional climatic systems, such as the Australian summer monsoon. Constraining the nature and timing of the postglacial rise in sea-level which flooded the lake provides evidence for global eustatic sea-level reconstructions. Analysis of sediment cores from the Gulf of Carpentaria, beginning around 40ka cal BP (forty thousand calendar years before present), shows the existence of Lake Carpentaria (a large, non-marine water body of fluctuating extent) until sealevel rose over the Arafura Sill and inundated the palaeolake around 10.5ka cal BP. The earliest studied phase dates to around 40ka cal BP which is a marineinfluenced brackish water lacustrine facies where Lake Carpentaria is briefly at its maximum extent: 12m deep in its deepest section. The existence of such a large body of water (around 150,000km2) supports the existence of a strong Walker Circulation in the region enhancing precipitation. Between 40ka and 18.8ka cal BP the non-marine, increasingly saline, Lake Carpentaria decreased to 7m maximum water depth, adding to the evidence of aridity around the LGM in northern Australia. At 18.8ka cal BP the lake freshened and monospecific bivalve, foraminiferal and ostracod populations dominated the still shallow (around 8m deep) lake. The lake was expanding, and from around 15&#177;2ka cal BP, fluctuations are noted in the general trend of increasing precipitation. The recorded variations in precipitation intensity may result from stronger seasonality (i.e. monsoons) and/or interdecadal variability (e.g. El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation). At 12.7ka cal BP Lake Carpentaria was at around 12m maximum water depth &#8211; the maximum documented extent in the studied period. At this stage there was some exchange of waters with the Arafura Sea via tidal outlet channels in the Arafura Sill (indicating sea-level around 60m below present), seen as a marine influence beginning in the western margins at 12.7ka cal BP. At 12.4ka cal BP the sealevel had risen to the same height as water levels within the lake (58m bpsl). By 12.2.ka cal BP sea-level was up to 2m higher than the previous lake level, and flowed into the lagoonal Lake Carpentaria via channels in the Arafura Sill. By 10.5ka cal BP the sea-level had overtopped the highest surface of the 53m-deep Arafura Sill and the transition to marine conditions began in the Gulf of Carpentaria, confirming the accepted models of sea-level rise.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/409</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new defence of poetry : and new possibilities from hypertext to ecopoetry</field><field name="creator">Bennett, John</field><field name="description">This thesis is, in part, a response to the loss of poetry as an epistemic discourse, a process that began with the development of writing. However, it is also energised by new opportunities of using the powerful tool of language, and techniques of poetry.The thesis aims to update previous defences of poetry, rebutting Plato&#8217;s initial attack in Ion, claiming poetry is non-cognitive. While building on a famous tradition, this thesis expands the repertoire of argumentation,  ncorporating findings from the cognitive sciences, and insights from pragmatist, phenomenological, and ecological perspectives on the emergent/embodied nature of cognition. An emphasis on a speech-based poetics and embodied skilled practice, with no claims to transcend the ordinary and everyday, undermines formalist approaches. This approach is developed through an investigation of two new forms of the poem &#8211; ecopoetry and hypertext poetry; fresh forms to reinvigorate, not only poetry discourse, but ways of dwelling in the world.Throughout this thesis, the processes by which language comes to mean, and be used, are explored, with a view to explaining the power of poetry. Poems provide cognitive opportunities for making use of the amazing cognitive techniques that we have co-evolved with; techniques, which put us in touch with our environments. This thesis is subject to adventure, and its arc of 16 short chapters closes with poems in Part 3.The thesis is presented in three parts:Part 1. Background Poetics - Poet as Language AnimalThis part explores a naturalistic and empirical account of the language animal, revealing how language is a powerful cognitive technique, used both internally and externally. Identified are:&#8226; Research findings from the cognitive sciences, which support emergent and interactionist models of the mind-brain-body, and suggest humans are embodied ecological beings;  &#8226; the key concepts of cognitive fluidity (mapping across domains); extelligence (externalising memory workloads); and scaffolding (extending the mind into the material world), all of which maximise cognitive abilities. Nature, mind-body, culture, tools and techne (embodied skill) are intertwined, processural and emergent; and &#8226; the fundamental poetic character of language (metaphoric, affective, musical etc.), which empowers and energises cognitive abilities. Poetry is a key tool of the multi-faceted techniques, which we name language. Poems are complex cognitive tools, which expand our ability to understand, and move through the world.Part 2. The Nature and Possibilities of PoemsPart 2 explores the nature and possibilities of poems, and:&#8226; proposes an explanatory tripartite model of the poem (Speech-Act; Practice/Discourse; Art(e)fact), and develops the notion that poems are cognitive scaffolds; &#8226; argues that ecopoetry is not simply a sophisticated development of nature/landscape genres, but requires a revolution in understanding the world, and how it works (including, importantly, homo sapiens). Attentiveness to environments and ecological cycles, and a prescriptive perspective to human interrelations, requires poems to be porous to the world, including other discourses, and varieties of experience. This, in turn, requires innovative and open forms. &#8226; critiques current trends in digital generative poetries, which frequently re-engage 20th C avant-garde techniques.

The complex multiple-segment nature of an IMRT plan makes it difficult to verify using traditional look-up tables and hand calculations.The purpose of this project was to develop an effective and time-efficient plan checking procedure using a combination of ionisation chambers and film. The dosimeters available were 0.03 cc volume and 0.6 cc volume thimble ionisation chambers, Kodak X-Omat V (XV) film and Kodak Extende Dose Range (EDR2) film. First the dosimeters were tested for accuracy in terms of their dose response in the clinical range required (up to about 200 cGy). All were found to be suitable for further investigation for use in IMRT plan checking.One non-IMRT and six IMRT plans were validated. The plans were transferred from the patient geometry to a 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm cubic phantom made up of slabs of solid water. The ionisation chambers and films were calibrated and used to measure the dose delivered to the phantom at the isocentre for each beam and for an entire IMRT treatment. The film was also used to provide axial and planar dose distribution maps for comparison with the predicted distributions. Time restraints meant that not every type of dosimeter was used for every beam and treatment plan.It was found that the isocentric 0.6 cc volume ionisation chamber provided a suitably accurate dose check, with an average difference between predicted and measured full treatment doses of 2.0 cGy with a standard deviation of 2.7 cGy and 1.5% with a standard deviation of 2.1%. The film was less successful, with the EDR2 film (digitised and analysed using ImageJ software) giving an average difference between predicted and asured full treatment doses of 5.4 cGy with a standard deviation of 4.0 cGy and 4.0% with a standard deviation of 3.1%. The film was very useful for obtaining qualitative dose distribution maps, which could be used as surrogates to verify that the radiotherapy treatment planning system&#8217;s co-ordinate information was being transferred correctly.Following the results of the test cases a procedure was established for all future IMRT plans. The procedure can easily be varied to include further measurements if necessary, and consists of measuring the dose at isocentre from each beam and the whole treatment using the 0.6 cc ionisation chamber. EDR2 film is to be used to visually verify the axial dose distribution, and XV film to verify planar dose distributions for each beam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/551</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biotechnology bingo modularity, knowledge processes, and the collaborative experience</field><field name="creator">Monty, Desiree A</field><field name="description">This thesis examines collaborative relationships between university scientists and private biotechnology firms. Using the concepts of modularity, boundary objects, and articulation, I demonstrate that these relationships are structured in a modular fashion. How knowledge is used, reused, and valued in an alliance is dependent upon the structure of that alliance. Knowledge is seen to exist in two forms &#8211; migratory, being mobile and combinable, and ingrained, being personally idiosyncratic and intertwined with specialization. In examining these forms of knowledge and the way that they are used by members of a collaboration, I use an interpretive methodology to analyze the data derived from four case studies of university-industry collaboration. One case study is based on an alliance in the United States and the other three cases present evidence from collaborations in Australia. I explore the appropriateness of applying the concepts of modular design to interorganizational collaborations, the production and use of knowledge within the boundaries of these structural arrangements, and the role of the university and firm scientists in the endeavour to develop therapeutics through the application of biotechnology. I argue that the movement of knowledge is dependent upon the structure through which knowledge processes are operationalized. In addition, I submit that knowledge based collaborations in biotechnology must be analyzed with respect to the larger contextual framework of the biopharmaceutical industry, with consideration of both the competitors of an alliance and the ill patients who stand to benefit from the work within an alliance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/556</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of novel nanostructured conducting polypyrrole fibres</field><field name="creator">Foroughi, Javad</field><field name="description">Polypyrrole (PPy) as a conducting polymer has potential applications in electrical and electronic devices because of its high electrical conductivity, environmental stability and redox activity. There have been many attempts to endow electrically PPy with processibility. Although some success has been achieved via synthesising soluble PPy, there have remained difficulties to fabricate this material through fibre spinning due to its low molecular weight and poor mechanical properties. Prior to this thesis, there was no report of the production of PPy fibres. This project therefore aimed to produce novel &#8220;polypyrrole fibres via the development of nanostructured conducting polypyrrole&#8221; by fibre spinning of PPy and to investigate the formed fibres for applications such as actuators, e-textiles, batteries, sensors and biomedical areas. As a result of the research conducted for this thesis, polypyrrole fibres have been produced for the first time. The initial wet-spinning process was enabled by the use of highly soluble non-functionalised PPy using di-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (DEHS) dopant, and the generation of a spinning solution of the PPy-DEHS in dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) solvent. Subsequent work sought to improve the properties of these first generation PPy-DEHS fibres by increasing the molecular weight, addition of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and addition of a supporting polymer (alginate). The use of the host polymer also enabled a new fibre spinning method to be developed that included an in situ polymerization process. Carbon nanotubes additions were achieved in two ways: firstly by adding small amounts of CNTs to the spinning dope; and secondly, a completely novel approach was developed whereby PPy was polymerized onto and into a CNT yarn. viii Each of the methods used to generate PPy fibres gave different performances in terms of mechanical strength / stiffness; electrical conductivity and electroactivity. Generally, it was found that adding of carbon nanotubes to the PPy improved the strength, stiffness and conductivity. The highest conductivity and Young&#8217;s modulus of any conducting polymer based fibre reported to date was obtained by incorporating PPy into a CNT yarn. The more robust fibres were assessed as mechanical actuators and a maximum strain of 2.5% was produced from the high molecular weight PPy-DEHS fibre. In summary, a range of novel fibrous PPy materials have been developed for possible use in applications such as actuators, sensors, artificial muscles, batteries and biomedical applications. The main aim of the thesis was to develop methods for continuous production of doped PPy fibres. This aim was successfully completed with a variety of different fibre compositions and properties demonstrated using a range of different fibre processing methods. ix</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3073</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainable socio-economic development in Tonga: challenges and responses</field><field name="creator">Fisi'iahi, Fotukaehiko Valeli</field><field name="description">Achieving good progress towards sustainable socio-economic development is a major issue for all developing countries, but it presents special challenges for small island economies. Tonga, a small island kingdom in the Pacific, is no exception. While Tonga is blessed with many human and physical resources, its remoteness, small size, and uneven progress have hampered sustainable socio-economic development.There are also internal attributes, which, while manageable, constrain the country&#8217;s socio-economic development. The thesis sought to provide answers to two important questions. Firstly, what has hindered or limited the sustainable socio-economic development of Tonga? Secondly, how can these challenges be addressed? These questions were identified in this thesis to be important, especially in light of the sluggish socioeconomic performance of the Tongan economy in recent years.In order to identify the most important factors, a comprehensive study of the barriers to entrepreneurship development in Tonga (published by Deacon Ritterbush in 1986) was reviewed, and compared with the barriers and problems that are still evident or recently identified in the 21st century.Three important issues were found to have considerable impact on the process of sustainable socio-economic development in Tonga. Drawing on qualitative research methods, the prime issues investigated were &#8216;weak governance&#8217; in family-run businesses and public enterprises, &#8216;market deficiencies&#8217;, and thirdly, the lack of an employment relations framework, and concomitant lack of &#8216;decent work&#8217;.If Tonga is to reach its potential, commitment is needed from the Tongan government, as well as from Tongan citizens, to give priority to good governance, to reduce marketing problems, and to ensure wide availability of &#8216;decent work&#8217; and effective employment relations legislation. This is not to undermine the policies already put in place by the government. Rather the findings of this thesis emphasise the importance of adopting appropriate and affordable policies and strategies in a coherent and timely manner for the benefit of the current and future generations of the people of Tonga.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/171</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensors and actuators for the cochlear implant using inherently conducting polymers</field><field name="creator">Wu, Yanzhe</field><field name="description">This study considered the use of various inherently conducting polymer (ICP)-based devices for utilisation with the cochlear implant. Investigations centred on the use of polypyrrole (PPy) to produce a mechanical sensor, actuators and controlled release devices. The development of a novel force sensor using the electrodes that are an integrated part of the cochlear implant itself was also investigated.Investigation into mechanically induce electrical signals using PPybased mechanical sensors showed that the polarity of the voltage output was dependent on the dopant ion in the conducting polymer. In addition, it was found that the signal amplitude was related to the redox state of the PPy and the concentration of mobile dopant ions within the PPy. This led to the &#8220;stress induced ion flux&#8221; mechanism being proposed for the first time to explain such observations.Actuator systems developed in this study included a PPy trilayer bending actuator, a PPy microfluidic pump and a PPy-coated hollow fibre. The study of PPy trilayer actuators led to several findings including a high amplitude harmonic vibration using a PPy/TFSI trilayer actuator, the first time that such behaviour has been observed for ICP-based mechanical actuators. A study of the blocking forces generated using such actuators in ionic liquid electrolytes suggested that switching from cathodic contraction to cathodic expansion occurs under the application of reducing potentials. This switching behaviour was found to depend on the amplitude and time of the electrochemical stimulation employed. It was shown that the expulsion of the dopant anion (PF6-) from the reduced polymer (- 0.8 V vs. Ag/Ag+) did not support the previously claimed cathodic expansion model. An ion diffusion controlled mechanism was proposed to explain the results obtained.Investigations into the novel &#8220;tube in tube actuator nodule&#8221; (TITAN) microfluidic pump based on PPy had led to the significant finding that, for the first time, the intrinsic resistance of PPy can be utilised to carry out peristaltic actuation for the purpose of fluid transport.The electrochemically controlled release of a model anion from the internal volume of a PPy-coated platinised PVDF hollow fibre was successfully demonstrated. Such controlled release was ascribed to the electrochemically activated incorporation / expulsion of small anions upon redox switching of polypyrrole resulting in enhanced ion transport across the concentration gradient from the internal volume of the hollow fibre to the receiving solution. The experimental findings suggested that electrochemically controlled release of anionic drugs is a real possibility using a device configuration consisting of a reservoir coated with an ICP membrane.By studying the electrochemical impedance changes in response to impact forces on the tip of a cochlear implant in artificial perilymph solution, it was found that the cochlear implant electrode itself can be used to detect impact forces. The findings were significant because such an approach provides a simple and safe method for the detection of possible dangers during surgical implantation of the cochlear implant. Factors influencing the response were investigated and these included solution composition and the orientation of the impact forces encountered.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/172</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade union joining: perceptions from call centre employees</field><field name="creator">Cantrick-Brooks, Bernadine Y</field><field name="description">Declining trade union density in Australia and overseas has been an issue of concern to the trade union movement and some industrial relations researchers. Many reasons have been proposed for this decline at both the macro and micro level, including changes in the structure of the economic base in Australia from manufacturing to services, and an increasingly hostile environment for unions. These issues are explored in a broad survey of the literature on declining union density.Drawing on the author&#8217;s experience in the call centre industry, the thesis uses a marketing research technique to investigate perceptions about unions held by call centre employees. Recruiting members in call centres has proved challenging due to factors such as geographical location of some call centres, anti-union management and a high level of non standard employment in call centres and an increasing tendency to individualism.Viewing the problem from a consumer behaviour perspective, the first issue was to find out what perceptions are held about unions by call centre staff and the second, how do these perceptions influence the union joining decision?Primary research using marketing research tools, Laddering and Means End Chain Analysis, provide a qualitative perspective on the decision making process and the perceptions of unions which underlie the union joining decision. Laddering is the interview technique associated with Means End Chain Analysis. It was developed to elicit the data needed to be analysed using Means End Chain and develop the Hierarchical Value Map.The Hierarchical Value Map indicated the links between the perceived attributes of unions: Powerful, Resources, Troublemaker, Costly and Outmoded and how these were linked to perceived consequences through to the goals or values held by the respondents of: Security, Social Value/Self Esteem, Achievement and Belonging.Factors which were found to affect perceptions were first, whether the respondent was viewing the union joining decision from a collective or individualist perspective, and second, whether they were taking an instrumental, ideological or normative approach to union joining.The use of cross discipline research methods offers further potential for research into trade union density.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/555</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career commitment in film production in the Australian film industry: a study using grounded theory</field><field name="creator">Jones, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a grounded theory study of the Australian Film Industry. The study set out to examine the performance effectiveness of production workers in the Australian Film Industry. Following the guidelines of grounded theory it became evident that there was an issue existing within the Australian Film Industry regarding career commitment. This issue arose because, while film workers felt they work very hard putting up with harsh work conditions, they perceived their rewards to be inadequate and not commensurate with their work efforts. This study looks at a case of career commitment in the Australian Film Industry. It examines what factors exist in the Australian Film Industry to commit workers to the industry despite the existence of inhibiting factors. This study finds eight career commitment factors which work to maintain worker commitment to the industry. These factors &#8211; job satisfaction, self-esteem, Hollywood factor, collegiality, autonomy, cost of leaving, volition and roles states &#8211; work individually and in combination to provide worker equity and thus facilitate career commitment in the Australian Film Industry. This research makes a contribution to knowledge in several ways. Firstly, the research fills a large gap in the research literature, as very few organisational researchers have studied the film industry in general, and the Australian industry in particular. Fewer still have examined career commitment. Secondly, the research provides valuable insight into the role of career commitment for film workers. Together these provide practitioners and academics with a clear and focused understanding of the role of career commitment, and its effect on workers in the Australian Film Industry. Thirdly, this research provides some practical guidance for managers in the Australian Film Industry that may assist them to develop better working relations with their crew in improving performance on the film set. Finally, this research demonstrates the strengths of using grounded theory for qualitative analysis in a organisational area of study. Through the application of this research method the study found a basic social process which was an area of concern to the participants and which led to the development of a substantive theory &#8211; that is Career Commitment in Film Production in the Australian Film Industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/37</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deliberate self-harm: a search for self or a cry for help?</field><field name="creator">Padoa, Carryn Tertia</field><field name="description">Objective: The aim of this study was to advance current research on the functions and expressions of self-injury and in particular to examine two motives of self-harm: (a) self-harm in response to threats to self (termed: search for self) and (b) self-harm as an act of communication to others (termed: a cry for help). Method: Study 1 investigated 45 participants attending accident and emergency departments following an episode of self-harm. All completed a structured interview and a repertory grid task. Interviews transcripts were classified: &#8216;cry for help&#8217; (anaclitic) or &#8216;search for self&#8217; (introjective). Self-harm characteristics were obtained using The Parasuicide History Interview which assesses for the number, method, intent, and medical severity of the self-harm event. Study 2 aimed to replicate study 1 using a clinical sample of 42 patients with Borderline Personality Disorder and comorbid Major Depressive Disorder. Results: Anaclitic typography represented significantly greater risk when compared to introjective psychopathology, despite the latter group exhibiting greater psychological constriction and more frequent episodes of self-harm. In addition, there appeared to be some important differences in the methods of self-harm chosen by the two groups, with anaclitic individuals utilising non-violent but potentially lethal methods compared to introjective individuals who utilised more violent and invasive methods of self-harm. Conclusion: Suicidal individuals who self-harm may be differentiated in terms of their motive, namely as a cry for help (anaclitic) or as a search for self (introjective). In this study, particular precautions and interventions are suggested following suicidal communications or behaviours by those individuals with anaclitic vulnerabilities, given their cry for help may be associated with more impulsive gestures that are unplanned and thus higher in medical lethality than introjective self-harmers, who engage in more frequent low-level attempts involving carefully planned actions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/146</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of newly discovered two dimensional cobalt based perovskite compounds doped with various rare earth elements</field><field name="creator">Yao, Qi Wen</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the study of a newly discovered two-dimensional CoO2 layer structured peroskite compound, Sr2CoO4. To explore doping effects on the physical properties of the new compound, a systematic and detailed experimental study has been carried out, relating to the aspects of synthesis, structure, transport and magneto-transport behaviour, magnetism, and dielectricity. Theoretical investigations have also been carried out for both crystal and electronic band structures, using Rietveld refinement and first-principles band structure calculations. Various rare earth element doped Sr2CoO4 polycrystalline compounds (Sr2-xRExCoO4, where x = 0.25 &#8211; 1.5 and RE = Pr, La, Gd, Eu, and Nd) were studied systematically. It has been found that the size and valence, as well as the doping level of the rare elements, control the physical properties of the Sr2CoO4. Ferromagnetic behaviour is found to exist in some of the doped compounds and to have interesting properties. It was observed that the lattice parameter a reminds relatively stable, with values around 3.7 to 3.8 &#197; for x = 1 for various RE doped compounds of Sr2-xRExCoO4. The Co-O(2) in-plane bond lengths were also not sensitive to different RE dopants for the x = 1 doping level. In contrast, lattice parameter c, as well as the out-of-plane bond length Co-O(1), varies with different RE dopants in the compound for the doping level of x = 1, and consequently, the unit cell volume also changes, depending on the RE dopant. It was found that Sr2CoO4 is the most tolerant to Pr as a dopant. For x values from 0.5 to 1.5, single phase Sr2CoO4 structured samples were achieved. La doping was compatible with single phase compounds for x = 1 &#8211; 1.25, and for Eu doping, single phase compounds were formed for x = 0.75 &#8211; 1. For both Gd and Nd doping, near single phases are formed for all the tested x values (x = 0.5 &#8211; 1.25).Our results show that some of the Pr-doped and La-doped single phase samples have large coercive fields, and hence, they have good potential industrial applications (permanent magnets in electric motors, magnetic recording media, etc.), while Eu-doped samples can have high magnetoresistance (MR) values, making the Eu-doped compound a good candidate for application as a colossal magnetic resistance (CMR) material. For the Pr-doped Sr2-xPrxCoO4, the lattice parameter c decreased with the Pr doping level x. The Curie temperature (TC) was found to be 200 K for Sr1.5Pr0.5CoO4. The resistivities were found to increase with doping level x. A large coercive field of about 1 Tesla (T) was found for the sample with x = 0.75. The values of the dielectric constant (&#949;) were over 2000 at low frequencies of less than 1 kHz (not shown here) and gradually decreased with increasing frequencies. The &#949; of the x = 1 sample is greater than that of the x = 0.75 sample, indicating that the charge induced capacitance in the x = 1 sample is greater than that of the x = 0.75 sample. This is in agreement with the trend of their resistivity measurements.   For the Eu-doped compounds of Sr2CoO4, single 214 phase was achieved for x = 0.75 - 1. The lattice parameter c decreased with the Eu doping level. The Curie temperatures were found to be around 160-200 K for samples with x = 0.75 and 1. An antiferromagnetic transition is observed at 35 K for the x = 0.75 sample. Magnetic semiconductor characteristics were observed for all the Eu-doped samples. The existence of unusually high magnetoresistance in these compounds makes them stands out from the rest of the RE doped compounds in this regard. For example, the sample with x = 1.25 showed a MR value of about 46% at 8 Tesla at 100 K. For the La-doped Sr2CoO4 compounds, the temperature dependence of the resistivity shows a semiconductor-like behavior over a wide range of temperatures, a metal-insulator transition at 240 K, and an upturn at 160 K for the x =1 , 1.25, and 0.75 samples. The coercive field was about 1 T for the sample with x = 0.75, while it is about 0.05 T for the x = 0.75 and 0.1 T for the x = 1.25 sample. A negative field hysteresis in the magnetoresistance in close correlation with the coercive field has been observed and can be explained by the grain boundary tunneling effect. First-principles band structure calculations were carried out for Sr1.5La0.5CoO4, and the results indicate that the system is metallic, with a high spin polarization which is responsible for the observed large magnetoresistance. The phonon density of states (PDOS) reveals that the Co 3d electrons and planar oxygen electrons are responsible for the high spin polarization at the Fermi surface in the compound. The Gd-doped Sr2CoO4 compounds were found to be paramagnetic semiconductors with MR values of only around 3 to 5%. Their transport properties can be described by the hopping model for semiconductors. Band structure calculations indicate that the spin polarization is high in the Gd-doped Sr2CoO4. Nd-doped compounds were found to be ferromagnetic semiconductors at temperatures of about 250 and 170 K for the x = 1 and 0.75 samples, respectively. Their MR valves were about 5 %, similar to those of the Gd-doped samples. The Nd doping raised the Curie temperature of Sr2CoO4, so that it reached 210 K for doping with Nd at levels up to x = 0.5.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/857</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strip detector for high spatial resolution dosimetry in radiation therapy</field><field name="creator">Cullen, Ashley James</field><field name="description">Radiation therapy is an established modality in the treatment of tumours. With treatments ever evolving and increasing in terms of their complexities, the need arises to ensure the best quality treatment is delivered; the survival of the patient relies upon it. A modern treatment such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy employs steep dose gradients varying dynamically to deliver complex dose profiles, whilst the experimental Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) involves the delivery of an array of intense beams tens-of-microns wide separated by several hundred microns. In both cases, conventional dosimetry is inadequate in providing both spatial and temporal information about complex dose profiles.The silicon strip detector was created to fill this void in current dosimetry techniques. Designed to withstand the intense beam of a synchrotron wriggler x-rays whilst not significantly perturbing the beam, the detector provides linear sensitive volume elements two hundred microns in pitch. This enables the ability to perform high spatial resolution dosimetry in real time.This thesis investigates the use of the silicon strip detector as an on-line dosimetry system for MRT with applications to clinical radiotherapy. Of particular interest is the distribution and magnitude of energy deposition within the detector and the perturbative effect the strip detector has on a synchrotron wriggler x-ray beam.Monte Carlo simulations are performed to investigate the properties of radiation incident upon the detector. These seek to understand how a beam traversing the detector interacts with it, as well as the effects the detector has on the transmitted beam and its properties.The energy deposition spectrum within the detector was found to be predominant at low energies of below 100 keV. The deposition of dose through the detector was found to be largely constant with depth through the central axis of a beam, dropping to ~10-3 of the central value at 50 &#181;m off the central beam axis for an infinitesimally thin pencil beam and ~10-4 at 100 &#181;m off-axis. Energy deposition laterally through water was determined as dominated by secondary electrons from the beam-edge to 150 &#181;m, and Compton photons thereafter.The depth dose of a MRT pencil beam was found to have an average decrease in dose of (1.44 &#177; 0.15) % (95% C.I.) when the strip detector was introduced into the beam. The probability of interaction of incident photons with the detector for the MRT spectrum was determined with GEANT4 and theoretically with a comparison made. The overall interaction probability of an MRT photon is (1.97 &#177; 4.43&#215;10-4) % (95% C.I.).A simulation to determine the PVDR (peak-to-valley dose ratio) in a MRT field was created, however only the peak dose could be determined due to an inadequate primary photon count. The peak dose was found to decrease by 1.41 &#177; 0.03 % (95% C.I.). Qualitative film measurements (deliberate overexposure of peak regions) displayed an increase of valley dose to film at 10 mm in water with the strip detector in the beam, but no such phenomenon at a depth of 1 mm. A simplified GEANT4 simulation was created to replicate such results with only five beamlets. Peak-to-valley dose ratio calculations from the simulation show no discernible effect at 1 mm depth, but a discernible increase in the PVDR at 10 mm depth; replicating experimental results.Since charge collection across a semiconductor device is often complex and dynamically varies with the bias conditions. Ion beam induced charge collection (IBICC) studies seek to investigate the charge collection properties of the detector in various voltage-biasing conditions. It was found that the application of reverse bias to strips adjacent to that being read out reduced the effective sensitive volume of the read-out strip. This provides evidence for a proposal to incorporate biased guard-ring structures to prevent charge sharing, and improve the confinement of the sensitive volume.Finally, clinical irradiations are performed with a highly collimated orthovoltage x-ray beam down to beam sizes of hundreds of microns. The spatial resolution of the detector in this configuration was found to be 500 &#181;m. The efficacy of the detector in contemporary radiotherapy is also investigated through the use of a 6 MV linear accelerator&#8217;s photon beam. Excellent agreement was found between strip detector read-outs and reference data for the linear accelerator. A quadratic relation was found between dose rate and charge per strip.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/848</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) community of practice responding to curriculum change</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Deborah K</field><field name="description">In 1999, the New South Wales Board of Studies (NSW BOS) released a revised Stage 6 Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) syllabus1. This syllabus signalled a significant discursive shift with subject knowledge altering to reflect a sociocultural perspective of health and physical activity. This shift challenged the identity of many Physical and Health Education teachers who have historically created their professional self around the scientific discourses of human movement.Physical and Health Education teachers have been criticised for their lack of engagement with and insensitivity to the socio-cultural aspects of the revised syllabus (Gard &amp; Wright, 2001; MacDonald et al. 2002), and been described as &#8220;elitist, sexist, 'pragmatic sceptics' and anti-intellectual&#8221; (Tinning, 2004). Given this professional identity, the question arose as to how professional development could assist NSW PDHPE teachers to engage with and commit to the socio-cultural perspective of the revised syllabus?Therefore the aims of the study were to identify the professional identity of the members of the community of practice (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991) of PDHPE HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers and establish how this identity influenced their preferences for particular aspects of the Stage 6 PDHPE syllabus. As a further educational outcome of this research, suggestions for professional development were proposed to assist PDHPE teachers to engage with curriculum change.As a mixed-method study, data gathering involved surveying PDHPE HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers, and undertaking semi-structured interviews with 25 PDHPE teachers. A range of NSW BOS and educational systems&#8217; professional development documents were used as artefacts. Survey data were analysed using Chi Square and Chi Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID). Interview data were analysed for themes relating to the value of participating in communities of practice to assist in responding to curriculum change. The results from the examination of both the survey and interview data sources indicated that a range of factors influenced the HSC option selections of NSW PDHPE HSC markers. These factors included the academic ability, sex and interest of their students. The profile of HSC markers also influenced their HSC option selection, with sources of professional development, years of teaching experience and sex of the marker being the most influential factors. The representative sample of HSC markers indicated that they were practical doers, seekers of certainty, gendered interpreters of the syllabus, and conservative participants in the broader PDHPE community of practice who maintain the status quo.The results of the survey data further revealed that the pre-service PDHPE teachers in the research sample were influenced in their selection of HSC options by their students&#8217; interest, their own expertise and interests, the pedagogy they believed could be used to teach a particular option, and the application of the option beyond school.Both HSC markers and pre-service PDHPE teachers indicated the benefits of engaging with colleagues as a resource for learning about a socio-cultural perspective of health and physical activity.By cultivating particular conditions within the PDHPE community of practice, members could engage with the socio-cultural perspective of the 1999 syllabus through their participation in situated and reflective learning experiences. The results of the thesis clearly indicate that by participating in overlapping communities of practice, acting as brokers, and creating time for reflection and shared dialogue that NSW PDHPE teachers can make meaning of and commit to the socio-cultural perspective of the 1999 Stage 6 syllabus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/42</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managers' stereotypes and their relation to employment decision-making in the workplace</field><field name="creator">Partridge, Barry R</field><field name="description">This study set out to establish the type and nature of decision-making that managers displayed at work, and ways in which those decisions may be related to managers&#8217; stereotyping of their colleagues. Ninety nine managers, drawn from six age-gender categories, made 594 employment decisions on six different age-gender categories of workplace colleagues. Managers&#8217; employment decisions were found to vary according to differences in the managers&#8217; own age-gender category with younger female managers more negative in their decision-making and younger male, older male and older female managers more positive in their decisions.The study made innovative use of a Personal Construct Theory-based (PCT) methodology (Kelly, 1955), to gain insights into managers&#8217; decision-making. A process of measuring manager-colleague social proximity determined managers&#8217; perceived differences from colleagues, and provided a means of comparing social distance measures with managers&#8217; employment decisions. Research aimed to establish whether managers&#8217; perceived social proximity with colleagues could vary according to differences in managers&#8217; or colleagues&#8217; age-gender categories, and if colleagues perceived more socially proximate would be assigned positive decisions by managers and those colleagues more distant, negative decisions. Study results confirmed managers&#8217; perceived social proximity with colleagues varied according to differences in managers&#8217; and colleagues&#8217; age-gender categories and managers were positive in their decisions on socially proximate, younger colleagues and negative in their decision-making, on more socially distant older ones.Stereotype research in the study sought to determine levels of abstraction with which managers held information in their stereotypes, and uses to which managers put that information in making employment choices between colleagues. A PCT-based methodology helped identify managers&#8217; workplace stereotypes and established relations between managers&#8217; stereotypes and their employment decisions. The managers&#8217; more meaningful interpretation of colleagues, expressed through superordinacy of constructs and commonality of usage of salient constructs, helped describe managers&#8217; stereotyping processes and identified those stereotypes managers were most likely to act on in their decision-making. The managers&#8217; stereotypes were found to hold both positive and negative prejudicial perceptions of the same person and to vary according to colleagues&#8217; age-gender category. Stereotype research results showed positive superordinate constructs associated with managers&#8217; stereotypes on younger age-gender categories as significantly related to managers&#8217; positive decisions on younger male and female colleagues. On the other hand, negative superordinate constructs associated with stereotypes on older female colleagues were significantly related to managers&#8217; negative decisions on the older female category. Positive stereotypes on younger colleagues, describing them as helpful and hardworking, were related to more positive employment decisions on younger males and females while negative stereotypes describing older females as traditional in approach and not being a good training investment were related to more negative decisions made on their category.Stereotype and decision research carried out in the study established the nature of managers&#8217; discriminatory decision-making and relation to managers&#8217; stereotyping of colleagues. Research results proved particularly useful in describing the nexus between managers&#8217; decision-making and stereotyping processes. Such results make an important contribution to current stereotype and decision research and practice. The methodology employed in this study is capable of being readily applied and can provide improved transparency of stereotypes thus facilitating changes to stereotyping and discriminatory employment practices operating in managers&#8217; workplaces.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/45</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficiency and productivity in Botswana's financial institutions</field><field name="creator">Moffat, Boitumelo D</field><field name="description">The productivity and efficiency of the financial sector is pivotal to the attainment of economic growth and development in developed and developing economies alike, and is of particular interest in the wake of financial sector reform and restructuring. The financial system in Botswana has undergone major structural and institutional changes in recent years. Throughout the 1980s a series of financial reforms were introduced to boost the efficiency and productivity of financial institutions by enhancing the crucial role of market forces (BoB, 1999). New entrants to the system and new products such as Automated Teller Machines (ATM), credit and debit card services were permitted as a result. To date, no study has been carried out to assess the impact of these reforms on the efficiency of financial institutions in Botswana.The main aim of this study is to conduct an empirical investigation of financial institutions in Botswana with a view to assessing their technical efficiency and productivity. By investigating technical efficiency and productivity among financial institutions in Botswana, this study addresses the following three questions: a) What is the mean efficiency score of financial institutions in Botswana? b) What is the total factor productivity change for Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions? c) What are the major determinants of efficiency in the context of Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions? Data envelopment analysis, which is a non-parametric approach, is employed in this study to analyse empirically the technical efficiency and productivity of financial institutions in Botswana. In order to assess the robustness and sensitivity of the results, three approaches namely, value-added approach, intermediation approach and operating approach are employed in defining the inputs and outputs of the institutions. The results suggest an asymmetry between institutions regarding their technical efficiency under different approaches over the years. Similar to Dos and Ghosh (2006), the yearly technical efficiency estimates under the value-added approach are mostly higher than those of the other two approaches. This is because DEA is a flexible technique and produces efficiency scores that are different when alternative sets of inputs and outputs are employed.Most of the inefficiency identified stem from the under utilisation of resources, as well as from the current scale of operation. This is consistent with other studies, for example, Rangan et al. (1988); Favero and Papi (1995); Taylor et al. (1997); Sathye (2001); Drake (2001) and Neal (2004).  The overall average efficiency score under the three approaches during the sample period for Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions is 0.62. This figure lies below other efficiency indices reported in other studies (for example see, Sathye (2003)), and this suggests that the banks in Botswana are performing relatively poorly. In terms of productivity analysis, the results indicate that there has been a loss or little productivity growth at the frontier during the period in question, although there has been some improvement in the relative efficiency of most of the financial institutions in Botswana. The loss in total factor productivity has, therefore, been mostly due to technological regress. The empirical results demonstrate that foreign institutions are, overall, relatively more efficient than their public counterparts under the three approaches. It is unlikely that public institutions, by virtue of undertaking most of the government borrowing programs, can generate a significant fee-based income from this source.The poor overall productivity performance of Botswana&#8217;s financial sector is cause for concern, as it is likely to constrain the growth and development of the overall economy. As a consequence, the authorities will need to rethink their reform measures to date with the objective of stimulating more competition in the marketplace.This thesis has made three significant contributions to the analysis efficiency in financial institutions. First, this is the first study to address the issue of efficiency and productivity in Botswana&#8217;s financial institutions using DEA and Malmquist indices. Second, this study has employed a larger category of financial institutions than that of other studies. Finally, no previous study has assessed efficiency, productivity and their determinants in one study. This study, therefore, extends the existing literature by assessing the efficiency, productivity and the determinants as one study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/728</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating university teaching and learning in an outcome-based model: replanting Bloom</field><field name="creator">Morris, Maureen Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis was inspired by an experienced teacher&#8217;s desire to enhance student learning through implementation of a teaching/learning framework focused on promotion of higher order cognition. Two case studies document the construction, implementation and evaluation of learning frameworks for two disparate undergraduate university subjects.Structurally, the thesis falls into three component parts. In the first, the researcher has reviewed the literature for an appropriate methodology, grounded her understanding of student learning through examination of relevant learning theories, canvassed suitable pedagogical strategies before construction of the teaching/learning frameworks, and devised an evaluation framework. In the second part, the two case studies have been described and in the final part, the threads of evidence have been drawn into the conclusion.Action research afforded an appropriate methodology for the study. It offered facility for a spiral of implementation, review and re-implementation. Bound as a practitioner by the pragmatic perspective of what works, the researcher engaged multiple methodologies (grounded research encompassing elements of phenomenology and ethnography) in both case studies. She adopted a mixed method approach, with evidence derived from assessment data, survey responses, her annotated journal and comments from collaborating teachers and students.The researcher&#8217;s primary intent was to construct aligned teaching/learning frameworks that promoted contextualised thinking for students in the two disciplines. Judgment of the effectiveness of the resulting frameworks in enhancing student learning required a strict evaluative regimen.Key issues percolated through the thinking of the researcher/teacher:&#8226; life-long learning;&#8226; meta-cognition and deeper learning; and&#8226; marking of assessment that recognises achievement of learning objectives, offers students task related feedback and does not merely represent an aggregation of marks for ranking of students along a curve.Therefore, strategies were included that fostered independent learning and promoted productive collaboration, while marking criteria formed the focus for aligning marking with the objectives.The primary case study examined teaching and learning in a foundation course in statistics at the University of Wollongong in Australia. The intent was to foster statistical thinking in students. Experienced in the field, the teacher assumed an active role as a participant researcher. In consultation with discipline experts and innovative teachers, the researcher/teacher observed the existing environment for a single session (N=159). Learning objectives were then rigorously scrutinised and behaviourally reframed; objectives were specified for learning and assessment tasks; and marking criteria devised to scaffold student responses, check assessment for objective achievement and provide detailed and task related feedback. Thus the objectives formed the agents of constructive alignment.Implementation of the selected strategies was tracked over the subsequent four sessions (cohorts ranging in size from 152 to 192 students). Evidence of student learning and the effectiveness of the framework was derived from:&#8226; assessment marks and grades;&#8226; deconstruction of assessment tasks and responses using the revised Bloom&#8217;s Taxonomy (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001);&#8226; student survey responses;&#8226; teacher and marker survey responses;&#8226; the researcher&#8217;s journal, annotated by collaborative teachers; and&#8226; peer discussions.Results have highlighted increases in mean marks in summative assessment accompanied by shifts to higher order cognitive demand in assessment tasks across the implementations. Furthermore, strong correlations between proportions of students reporting confidence in topic learning and exam performance have lent credence to the teacher&#8217;s claim that students know what they know and know what they do not know.The aim of the second case study was the design and implementation of an aligned curriculum for a subject focused on promoting critical and evaluative thinking in undergraduate accounting students. Although not the teacher/researcher&#8217;s field of expertise, intense consultations with the subject designers produced behaviourally framed objectives and a teaching/learning framework that targeted the desired skills. This case study consisted of a single implementation (N=223). Results were not conclusive, but examination of the detail has provided fresh insight into the potential value of peer evaluation and student portfolios to address the desired thinking.Comparison of the two case studies has highlighted the marked similarity between the teacher&#8217;s expectations of statistical thinking, which underpins the University of Wollongong subject, and critical and evaluative thinking, which underpins the University of Western Sydney subject. &#8216;Structure&#8217; has been identified as essential to successful implementation of the frameworks targeting discipline thinking. The structure of the desired thinking needs not only to be modelled but also to be recognised by students before it is effectively assimilated.The researcher&#8217;s journey has required reflective practice that includes both telescopic and microscopic review of her thinking, her habits and the action and reaction occurring within her classroom. The evaluation of student learning undertaken in this thesis has formalised the teacher&#8217;s informal and intuitive response to the ostensibly absurd behaviours that take place as her students learn. Her deconstruction and interpretation of the apparent incongruities has at once affirmed past practice and inspired its renewal.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/784</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Curating inscription: the legacy of textual exhibitions of tattooing in colonial literature</field><field name="creator">Werner, Anne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the colonial context of the tattoo&#8216;s reintroduction to the west, and the exhibitionary nature of its cultural presence in the Euro-American public&#8216;s consciousness, has been mediated and to a degree determined by cultural understandings of processes of exhibition and display. The tattoo&#8216;s role in performances of Otherness has allowed it to be manipulated and utilized by authors who, I argue, &#8215;curate&#8216; their textual artifacts in accordance with the conventions offered by other exhibitionary mediums. The complicated nature of the tattoo&#8216;s relationship with popular cultural representations of colonialism has meant that the reclamation of traditional tattooing, for many cultures, demands an engagement with the colonial histories of representation illuminated in this thesis. Selected texts, including Herman Melville&#8216;s Typee and Omoo, a number of beachcomber narratives, the narratives surrounding the captivity of Olive Oatman, and contemporary representations of Maori in tourist imagery, are examined in order to expose the colonial history of representations of tattooing and the irreversible impact this history has had upon the west&#8216;s conception of &#8215;tattoo&#8216;. The literary analysis focuses upon the concept of the text as exhibition, and the author as curator, and uses theoretical approaches from museum, performance and tourism studies, including work by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Anne Maxwell, Jane Desmond, Tony Bennett and Dean MacCannell to strengthen and nuance the textual readings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/785</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a grounded theory of critical viewing</field><field name="creator">Hadfield, Colin</field><field name="description">This thesis is a report on a study in viewing which details the construction of a grounded theory about &#8216;a pedagogy for critical viewing&#8217;.

It looks into the role of the Philippines in establishing the first growth quadrangle in South East Asia or the Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines - East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA or simply EAGA). There was no EAGA without Philippine enthusiastic in proposing the idea. EAGA became the first sub-regional economic cooperation to back up Philippine national development program; that is the Philippines 2000 and the NIC-hood vision. The establishment of EAGA represented Philippine foreign relations with regional countries, and the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN) as the longest running regional association. The relevance of EAGA was in controversy. The affirmative perspective ensured that EAGA was built in economic term to promote trade, investment and tourism for the regional countries, which experienced similar historical of colonialism, and cultural and religious backgrounds. Some achievements have been made through many numbers of working groups&#8217; meetings, expositions and conferences since the EAGA formation in 1994 until now. On the other hand, the pessimistic perspective highlighted the negative impacts of the EAGA growth quadrangle. The failure of poverty eradication was one of the social impacts. EAGA seems to be more hopeless when indicated to problems, which exist at the national, regional and global levels and related each other. Crony capitalism, inter-religious conflicts and process of democracy are major domestic issues that have affected the EAGA business activities, besides the Asian Crisis in 1997. The practice of crony capitalism is related to domestic political culture and the influence of market orientation or economic liberalism. Global war against terrorism is another international factor, which affected regional political development. The future of EAGA is clearly dependent on to what extents member countries can cope with their domestic problems. Similar phenomenon happened with ASEAN in which its function as regional economic integration has been subordinated by the dominance of political disputes bilaterally and multilaterally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/52</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender and nation formation in late nineteenth century</field><field name="creator">Rowley, Susan Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In the late nineteenth century, literary narratives and visual representations of the Australian bush played a major role in the historical process through which Australia was becoming conceptualised as a nation. This thesis examines features of these representations&#8212;the role of the journey, the portrayal of women's labour, the role of the swagman and of madness, the representation of motherhood, mateship and marriage, the scope and role of the imagination, and narratives of community&#8212;in there historical context. Using this analysis the thesis shows how the process of national cultural imagination was in part shaped by the experience at the time of both modernisation in public and domestic life, and change and contestation in the gender order.Bush mythology frequently employed the notion of the masculine journey as an image of nation formation. The journey was used to represent a quest for nationhood which was to be achieved through the domestication of the land in the name of 'Australia'. The end of the journey&#8212;frequently figured as the return to the interior space of the home&#8212;was associated with the achievement of maturity on the part of both the traveler and the nation. Whilst men might embark on such journeys, female maturity was usually represented as a move into the home. This move, which appeared to take women out of the nation-space, testifies to the difficulty at the time of bringing men and women together into an imagined Australian national community.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1928</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Key biological parameters and commercial fishery for ocean leatherjackets 'Nelusetta ayraudi' (Monacanthidae) off the coast of New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Miller, Marcus E</field><field name="description">Ocean leatherjackets (Nelusetta ayraudi) are distributed along the entire coast of New South Wales (NSW) contributing significantly to the total catch of fish taken from the NSW Ocean Trap and Line Fishery (~340 tonnes in 2005/2006), in addition to other NSW fisheries, such as the Ocean Fish, Ocean Prawn and Haul-net Fisheries.    In spite of their significance in commercial fisheries world-wide, only few studies have aged monacanthids.  Of those, researchers have mainly used bony structures, such as vertebrae and anterior dorsal spines.  In this study, commercially captured ocean leatherjackets were aged by counting growth increments in thin-sectioned otoliths. The periodicity of increment formation was validated using a vital stain oxy-tetracycline (OTC) injected into young of the year fish (0+).  The von Bertalanffy growth function parameters provided good estimates of growth, k = 0.163 yr-1, t0 = -0.565 yrs and L&#8734; = 886 mm.  The fishery was found to be dominated by two and three year old fish making up 83% of the ocean leatherjackets captured.  The oldest fish (5+) and largest fish from both sexes (male &#8211; 605 mm, female &#8211; 656 mm) were found in northern NSW.  All fish displayed a rapid rate of growth especially as juveniles, with no significant differences in growth between sexes and locations (southern and northern NSW). Ocean leatherjackets showed a geographical and temporal &#8216;preference&#8217; for spawning.  Gonado-somatic indices (GSI) revealed a peak in spawning during August in northern NSW.  During this period adult fish were observed, via depth soundings, in large aggregations in depths ranging from 45 to 80 fathoms.  Ocean leatherjackets are pelagic egg broadcasters with no parental egg care.  Oocytes from ovulated ocean leatherjackets had a mean diameter of 0.66 mm (&#177; S.E. 0.002).  The estimated size and age at maturity (L50) for each sex was 352 mm and 2.5+ years old.  Mature fish of each sex displayed clear differences in dimorphic and dichromatic features. This research has provided the biological information necessary for future stock assessments of ocean leatherjackets in NSW.  In addition, it has contributed to management strategies designed to enhance the sustainability of the ocean leatherjackets fishery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/26</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appropriating culture to recuperate history/prisoner</field><field name="creator">Keeley, Terence J</field><field name="description">The following thesis consists of three parts: a research paper comparing two other texts, In Country by Bobbie Ann Mason and The Book of Laughter and Forgetting by Milan Kundera, that incorporate the same or similar strategies as those adopted in the creative component of the thesis, a synopsis of two related texts preceding the creative component, and finally, the creative component itself, Prisoner.  	The essay, requiring research into critiques of the Mason and Kundera texts, found a number of parallels between them and my own creative practices relating to Prisoner. All three texts can be seen to appropriate icons of popular culture, and high culture on the part of Kundera, as part of their strategy to tell a story. Additionally, all three can be seen to develop similar, and occasionally oppositional, philosophical discourse on the recuperation of history, at both a personal and political level.	The inclusion of a synopsis of two creative texts written prior to Prisoner, was deemed necessary as they set the stage for the third and final text in completing an extended narrative. 	The creative text itself completes the story begun in the previous texts, The Visitation and The Interview, and resolves the ambiguities inherent in the previous texts. Additionally, it incorporates a strategy, much like Mason and Kundera, of appropriating a popular cultural icon in Prisoner &#8211; the television series of the early eighties, as part of its discourse into the recycling and re-interpretation of history conducted by the story&#8217;s characters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/23</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of Australian journalism in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Tapsell, Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the changing professional practice of Australian journalists since they began reporting in Indonesia from 1945. Existing literature on the Australian media in Indonesia has emphasised the problem of biased and troublesome Australian journalists who have deliberately caused bilateral relations disturbances between Australia and Indonesia. It is argued that the existing literature overstates the agency of Australian journalists, and downplays the attitudes and roles of governments and news forces in the shaping of journalists&#8217; professional practice. This thesis will show how Australian journalists and their Indonesian staff have attempted to report what they saw as the &#8216;truth&#8217; from the archipelago, yet have been subjected to numerous pressures and vii constraints that hinders their professional practice and limits their autonomy. In particular, Indonesian staff working for Australian news agencies have been subjected to numerous pressures from a hierarchical system of newsgathering and from their own government. The Indonesian Government and military have attempted to control the flow of news through often crude and violent tactics to hinder journalists&#8217; professional practice. The Australian Government, which supports the notion of a free press, has also limited Australian journalists&#8217; professional practice in Indonesia. The news system requirement for journalists to seek elite sources and the improvements in communications technology have also hindered the freedoms for Australian journalists as they operate from Indonesia. Thus, it is argued that Australian journalists in Indonesia and their local staff have worked under a range of constraints and have been pressured to serve a variety of competing masters in reporting from the archipelago. Their work has to be understood as a complex artefact crafted in response to this range of insistent and intrusive pressures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3028</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Looking through the twin lens of race and gender: a new politics of surveillance in Asian Australian and Asian Canadian women's writing"</field><field name="creator">Morris, Robyn</field><field name="description">&#8220;Looking Through the Twin Lens&#8221; examines how an emergent body of fiction by contemporary Asian Australian and Asian Canadian women writers engages in revisionist tactics, complicating the hierarchical nature of the politics of looking. Recent feminist theories explore the link between the male gaze, images of the female body in mass media representations and the tradition of the high art nude, but they have neglected to contextualise other forms of embodiment such as race. This study extends the theory of a gendered gaze into the area of race. Texts by Australian-based writers Simone Lazaroo, Lillian Ng and Hsu-Ming Teo and Canadian-based Hiromi Goto, Larissa Lai and Evelyn Lau, have been selected for their intercession and intervention with established ways of seeing, gazing and looking. These texts are connected not only by each writer&#8217;s Asian ancestry and their female authorship, but also by their scopic thematics and by their literary entry into contemporary individual and national identity politics. While contemporary feminist theory has prompted a re-reading of well-known texts of the West through the lens of gender, the recurring reference to well-recognised filmic or literary narratives in many of these writer&#8217;s works, allows for an interrogative return to the original through the twin lens of gender and race. In this sense, contesting the dominance of white hegemony involves both a return of the gaze and a return to issues of misrepresentation that are central to a past and contemporary cultural politics of difference.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/783</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive predictive vibration control in vehicular rear view mirrors</field><field name="creator">Larchez, Antoine</field><field name="description">Reduction in rear view mirror vibration has been identified as a research and development priority by large automotive mirror manufacturers, such as Schefenacker Vision Systems Australia Pty Ltd (SVS), the industrial partner of this project. Mirror vibration, particularly in luxury and heavy vehicles, has proved to be a major source of complaints received from the customers. Such vibration may result in image blurring and the loss of rear vision. This can adversely affect the driver, the control of the car, and the safety of the driver and the passengers. The vehicle mirror vibration is also generally perceived to indicate the poor quality of a vehicle. Mirror glass vibration is primarily caused by wind as the result of the motion of the vehicle. The structure-borne vibrations also contribute to vibration by affecting the mirror&#8217;s housing. The vibration intensity will depend on parameters, such as the roughness of the road, the engine speed, and wind intensity. Under some circumstances, the image provided by the mirror is not indicative of the true conditions behind the car, which can lead to incorrect perception and to driver misjudgement, resulting in the increased risk of an accident. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of developing an intelligent active vibration controller capable of maintaining a sharp reflected image under all driving conditions. An adaptive predictive controller is proposed. As an adaptive method, the proposed system can generate a control signal, according to the driving conditions, to cancel the vibration. The predictive characteristics of the approach can minimise the effect of delay between the measurement of the vibration signal and the generated control signal. An extensive review of the literature relevant to rear view mirrors, measurement techniques and active control of noise and vibration is carried out. The nature of the mirror vibration based on the road data is obtained empirically and statistically characterised. In order to develop and validate the vibration compensator, a number of experimental rigs are designed and developed. In a rigorous and systematic approach, a number of active vibration techniques are developed and validated through computer simulation and experimental work. The structure of nearly all of these algorithms is based on internal model control, where the actual disturbance signal is reconstructed analytically. The control structures include at least one variant of the FxLMS adaptive filter in different configurations. The results of modelling and validation are systematically recorded in the thesis. The results obtained show that the methodologies proposed in this study, outperform the conventional controllers in reducing vibration levels in rear view mirror.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1939</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework of an effective online help system to support nurses using a nursing information system</field><field name="creator">Qiu, Yiyu</field><field name="description">Research Aim and Questions: This research aims to develop a quality framework of an effective Online Help System (OHS) for a Nursing Information System (NIS). This involves the identification of the criteria for an effective OHS. The research questions are what content, structure, functions and aesthetics this OHS should have. The research will also provide guidelines about how to evaluate the usability of an OHS. To learn unfamiliar features or functions of a Nursing Information System (NIS), nurses need effective and efficient assistances. An OHS, which aims to bridge the gap between the complexity of a NIS and nurse-users&#8217; need for simplicity, is one effective solution. However, systematic research on the design and evaluation of an OHS is not common. There is a lack of a comprehensive quality framework that could provide guidance on the design and evaluation of an OHS for a NIS. As nurses are important healthcare workers, their acceptance and usage of a NIS is important for the improvement of quality of healthcare data, it is imperative to conduct this research with strong potential to impact on the adoption of NIS by nurses. Research Methodology: Two phases of investigation were carried out. Guided by a grounded theory approach, we first proposed a quality framework of an effective OHS for a NIS. In order to prove the validity of this framework, an experiment was carried out in which an OHS for an authentic NIS (the Care Planning and Assessment Tool) was developed and evaluated. Various research methods were employed in collecting data, i.e. laboratory-based usability testing, focus group discussion and questionnaire survey. Results: The proposed framework was consisted of the five criteria (i.e. content, structure, functionality, aesthetics, and usability. The CPAT Online Help was designed according to the results of the needs assessment and the forty-three guidelines that reflect the quality indicators in the framework. The results of the heuristic evaluation of the CPAT Online Help shows that the help system highly reflect on the proposed framework. The results of the usability testing suggest that the usability of both online help and hard-copy help manual is similar (i.e. no significant group difference was found for the results of both laboratory testing and the answers to the user satisfactory survey between online help and hard-copy help manual). However, in the laboratory experiment, the overall performances of the participants who used the CPAT Online Help were obviously better than those of the participants who used the hardcopy user manual. In addition, the survey responses from the former were more positive than those from the latter. Discussion and Conclusion: The proposed quality framework and their indicators were validated and supported by our research results and findings. Our research suggested that 1) nurse users&#8217; basic computer skills, knowledge about an NIS, knowledge about procedures of nursing documentation should be covered in an OHS; 2) function-oriented and task-oriented structure are the effective structures of an OHS; 3) table of contents, frequently ask questions, search engine and video demonstration are effective functions; 4) visual-effectiveness can facilitate a nurse-user&#8217;s problem solving 5) the indicators of the usability of an OHS is the 5Es: effectiveness, efficiency, error-tolerance, engaging and ease of learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/9</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between parental divorce and the psychological well-being of children with AD/HD: differences in subtypes, age, gender and comorbidity</field><field name="creator">Heckel, Leila</field><field name="description">It is generally accepted that Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) results from a dysfunction of the central nervous system, which has led to a commonly-held belief that environmental factors play little role in the behavioural problems of these children. However, this perspective has been poorly investigated. This thesis examined the relationship between parental divorce and the psychological well-being of children with AD/HD. Subjects were aged 6 to 18 years and were diagnosed with either the inattentive or combined subtype of the disorder. Firstly, the relationship between parental divorce and the symptom profile of children with AD/HD was investigated. Differences in children&#8217;s behaviour between (a) divorced and non-divorced families, (b) single-parent households and step-families, and (c) single-divorced and multiple-divorced parents, were examined. A possible relationship between the quality of family relationships and children&#8217;s symptom profile was investigated. Subtype, age, and gender differences were evaluated in terms of symptom severity and comorbid conditions. Secondly, parents&#8217; perceptions of the impact of their children&#8217;s behaviour on marital status and family/parental functioning were examined. The major results were that (a) parental divorce was associated with greater symptom severity, more externalizing/internalizing behaviours, and poorer social functioning, but less with academic underachievement, (b) children living in step-families presented with greater impairment than those in single-parent households, (c) differences in psychological well-being between children with AD/HD of single- and multiple-divorced parents were minor, (d) poor relationships with family members correlated with children&#8217;s overall behaviour, (e) parental divorce was related to adjustment differences in AD/HD subtypes, age, and gender, and (f) the correlation between behaviour problems of children with AD/HD and marital/family dysfunction was weak. It may be concluded that parental divorce was associated with the psychological well being in children with AD/HD, and there is some suggestion to view AD/HD as a bio-psychosocial disorder.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/10</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular identification and thermal attributes of forensically important blowflies (Diptera: Calliphoridae: Chrysomya)</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Leigh Alden</field><field name="description">Forensic entomology applies the study of arthropods associated with carrion, in terms of species succession and development rates, to determine the minimum time since death, or postmortem interval (PMI). Correct species identification is crucial, as the rate of larval development can vary substantially between species. The identification of forensically important blowflies of the genus Chrysomya (Diptera: Calliphoridae) may be hampered by their close morphological similarities, especially as immatures. DNA-based approaches, such as those investigated here, have the capacity to be useful for the identification of forensic entomological evidence in cases where morphological characters are unreliable. In this study, two DNA regions were investigated as potential candidates for the identification of the nine Chrysomya species in Australia: (1) the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and (2) the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) DNA &#8216;barcode&#8217; region. The ITS2 region was assessed by sequence comparison, which identified five restriction enzymes (DraI, BsaXI, BciVI, AseI and HinfI) that were able to differentiate most members of the genus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The closely related species pairs Chrysomya latifrons + Chrysomya semimetallica and Chrysomya incisuralis + Chrysomya rufifacies could not be separated by restriction profile analysis, but the latter could be separated using the size differences resulting from amplification of the entire ITS region. Identical restriction profiles were generated from eight Ch. incisuralis specimens, suggesting low intraspecific ITS2 variation within this species. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS2 sequence, which is a possible means by which species could be identified, proved successful for the identification of the majority of Chrysomya species. The COI &#8216;barcode&#8217; region resolved all nine Chrysomya species as reciprocally monophyletic, following a neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis of the Kimura twoparameter distances. Mean intraspecific and interspecific sequence divergences were 0.097% and 6.499%, respectively. The hybrid status of one specimen was confirmed Abstract viii following subsequent ITS2 sequence analysis. In another instance, this nuclear region was used to verify four cases of specimen misidentification that had been highlighted by the COI analysis. The COI DNA barcode was successful in identifying Chrysomya species from the east coast of Australia. The ability of the barcode to identify two Chrysomya nigripes specimens from Thailand shows potential for this method to be expanded to other blowfly genera and continents. This result confirmed previous successes with COI as a genetic barcode for species identification and comparisons at the intra- and interspecies levels. Together with correct species identification, thermodevelopment data of blowfly species are vital for the estimation of the PMI. The close morphological and molecular similarities among Chrysomya species led to speculation as to whether members of this genus shared similar developmental profiles. The aim was to establish whether genetically closely related species would share similar developmental profiles. This would permit the application of developmental data to a number of closely related species, including those for which thermodevelopmental studies are lacking. If Australian Chrysomya were found to share developmental profiles, identification of the blowfly specimen to a level beyond genus may not be necessary, or at least it may not be necessary to distinguish morphologically similar sister species. The experimental design employed in this study sets it apart, to date, from other published larval development studies. Nowhere else have the developments of such closely related blowfly species been compared. As the species were collected from the same geographical location, the effects of acclimation and population-level genetic variation were not variables in this study. The experimental conditions in this study were virtually identical, which enabled direct comparisons to be made among the species. This study established that the sister species Ch. megacephala and Ch. saffranea differed significantly in their developmental profiles, as well as compared with the more distantly related Ch. rufifacies. Because of this, genetic distance was not considered to be a useful factor for predicting thermodevelopment profiles of closely related species within a genus, and highlighted the necessity for correct species identification.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/529</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public sector deficits and macroeconomic performance in Lebanon</field><field name="creator">Saleh, Ali Salman</field><field name="description">The major aims of this study are as follows. First, to macro model prospective developments in the Lebanese economy for policy analysis and evaluation. The main purpose of this study is to develop a dynamic macroeconomic model for Lebanon including the budget deficit and the funding of it, as well as the composition of government expenditures (capital or current). Hence this study develops behavioural equations not used before for Lebanon. The model developed emphasises the effects of exogenous shocks arising from budget deficits and the funding of it (e.g. monetary accommodation or bond financing). This macroeconomic model is utilised as well to analyse the effects of exogenous shocks arising from increased government expenditures (capital expenditure or consumption expenditure) upon key macroeconomic variables. The current government&#8217;s policy approach as well as the separate government policies in response to the Lebanese fiscal crisis is analysed as well through the use of this macroeconomic model. The second aim of this study is the application of estimation techniques to Lebanese data. This study generates parameter values of key macroeconomic behavioural relationships in the context of Lebanon by using efficient estimation techniques and appropriate data definitions for Lebanon. This represents a new contribution to the literature, since there have not been any empirical studies on such relationships in the case of Lebanon. The third aim of this study is the application of a simulation analysis to the Lebanese economy. This study conducts a numerical simulation analysis of the macroeconomic model developed, in order to analyse a number of economic policies in the context of the Lebanese fiscal crisis with the aim of improving the country&#8217;s macroeconomic performance. Since there has been no research in the area of simulation and policy analysis for the case of Lebanon, this research makes a major contribution to the literature and to an understanding of the Lebanese economy. The model developed in this study is based on the contributions of the Dornbusch model (DB) (1976), the portfolio balance model (PBM) (Branson (1977, 1984) including the work of Dornbusch and Fisher (1980). The model also  ncorporates the work of Harvie and Kearney (HKM) (1996). The DB and PBM models have a number of deficiencies, especially the neglect of the supply side of the economy; no wealth effects; no funding implications from fiscal deficits; and a lack of stock-flow interactions, among others. The model developed attempted to remedy these deficiencies by incorporating the supply side of the economy, wealth effects, capital stock accumulation, alternative ways of funding the budget deficit and the composition of  government expenditures (capital or current). Hence, many amendments have made to these existing models in order to make the model developed more applicable to the case of Lebanon, especially to analyse the impact of the composition of budget funding and the composition of government expenditures shocks on macroeconomic variables. Because of a lack, or unavailability, of parameter values for key macroeconomic behavioural relationships in the context of Lebanon, and the need for these parameters values in the conduct of a simulation analysis, this study empirically estimated the behavioural equations of the macroeconomic model developed by using efficient testimation techniques (FIML, ECM) and appropriate data definitions for Lebanon. The results from the FIML approach indicated the existence of long run relationships, or cointegration, for all the equations employed. The findings of cointegration allow us to investigate the dynamics of the system with the information of the cointegration relationship, and an error-correction model (ECM) is estimated. Hence these estimates (the long run and short run estimated coefficients from cointegration and the error correction model) provide a range of possible parameters values, which are used to conduct a simulation and policy analysis in chapter 7. The parameter values estimated make a unique contribution to the literature, since there are no other empirical studies analysing such behavioural relationships in the case of Lebanon. In addition, this study examined the time series data to find out whether the series are stationary or non-stationary, by using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. The results showed that only real private consumption expenditure ( c p ), real government investment spending ( i g ), rate of change of real bonds stock (b&amp;&#8722; p&amp;) , real government expenditure (g) and real private investment spending ( i p ) seem to be stationary I(0). The rest of the variables included in the model are found to be non-stationary of different orders, either I(1) or I(2). The major findings from the simulation results presented in this study are that, implementing the policy of expansion in government capital expenditure, for two presumed cases (unanticipated/gradual), produces larger favourable impacts upon Lebanese economic development in terms of private sector investment, and in terms of the supply side of the economy (crowding in effects) during the whole adjustment process towards long run steady state. This policy produces, as well, favourable impacts in terms of external developments. Implementing the policy of an expansion in government consumption expenditure produces unfavourable effects in terms of external developments during the djustment process. The trade balance deteriorates in line with a deterioration in foreign asset stocks as a result of current account deficits, and hence results in an increase in foreign debt. This policy produces, as well, unfavourable effect in terms of private investment and aggregate supply (crowding out effect). Implementing the two policies (expansion in capital expenditure/government consumption expenditure) produces similar outcomes in terms of the interest rate and the rate of inflation. However, both policies produce higher inflation during the short run period. The interest rate is higher as well during the first year of the short run period due to the increase in public spending arising from the funding component through bond sales. However, the simulation results for the two policies show that money deficit financing is inflationary and shows large sensitivity in terms of the interest rate. Bond financing is non inflationary and shows little sensitivity in terms of interest rates. The main finding is that if the government considers a fiscal expansion policy in order to improve macroeconomic performance, the simulation results suggest that the government should adopt the policy of an expansion in capital expenditure because it produces the most desirable outcomes. In addition, it should adopt a gradual approach because this produces considerably less volatility in terms of major macro variables. The main findings from our simulation results dealing with the government approach to the fiscal crisis, does not support the government policy in dealing with the crisis. The results presented suggest that it produces the most undesirable economic outcomes, and hence will only exacerbate Lebanon&#8217;s economic difficulties. However, if the Lebanese government is willing to go ahead with this approach, it is advised that, based upon the results presented and in order to minimise the adverse effects of this policy, the government should adopt a gradual approach because it leads to much less macroeconomic volatility. Another important conclusion is that the government in Lebanon should be aware that the reduction in government expenditures, in order to reduce the budget deficit, is not the best strategy and especially the policy of reduction in government capital expenditure. If the government in Lebanon decides to implement the policy of expansionary monetary policy in order to reduce the budget deficit, our results show that this policy will have some positive effect on Lebanon&#8217;s economy, but the government has to be aware that this policy has an inflationary effect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/364</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On information hiding techniques for digital images</field><field name="creator">Brisbane, Gareth Charles</field><field name="description">In the era before digital devices, information was in part protected by the cost of duplication. However, as information is more commonly stored to and recovered from digital devices, its duplication becomes trivial. In recent years there has been an increasing amount of research into methods for embedding hidden information into items stored in digital formats. This information can then be used for a range of purposes, including content protection, traitor tracing, authentication and covert communications. In this thesis we exclusively consider the case of information hiding techniques for digital images. We address four problems in this research area: &#183; We consider the question, How much data can be imperceptibly embedded into an image, assuming that the sender and receiver have access to a shared image and that there is no modification of the communication during its transmission? Firstly, the maximum amount of information that can be sent for both monochrome and colour images using this model is derived. We then present coding strategies which nearly achieve the theoretical capacity, operating under the restrictions imposed by image formats, namely that the range of possible pixel values is limited. Results are provided demonstrating that the scheme can be used in practice to achieve the claimed throughput. &#183; We seek discover the set of N codevectors which best represent an n-dimensional, uniformly distributed space. This result could then be considered for the specific case of identifying the general colour palatte in Red/Green/Blue space which is best able to quantize a uniformly distributed colour image. The problem is addressed initially from a theoretical perspective, followed by an empirical analysis. The results are then compared, in terms of distorttion caused by quantization, against lattices, which are known to be an optimal selection of codevectors for large N. &#183; Seppanen, Makela and Kreskinarkaus propose a high capacity steganographic technique to conceal information within a colour image[72], using a shared colour palette. The technique is significant because of the high volume of data that is embedded into pixels but results in a high level of noise and so the quality of the resulting image is not acceptable. We propose: - Technique to improve the tradeoff between capacity and imperceptibility; - New &#8220;coding structures&#8221; which maintain a high capacity but lower the level of noise; - A strategy for increasing robustness; and - An analysis of the tradeoff by using an alternative algorithm for identifying the colour palette. Results are provided for the evaluation of each proposed modification. The resultant scheme, without robustness, is able to embed an average of over 6 bits per pixel at an imperceptible level of pixel modification. &#183; A robust watermarking technique is proposed which modifies the statistics of extracted segments. By using a region-based approach, resistance is provided to a range of attacks, including rotation, scaling and translation based modifications. The advantage of this algorithm is that no manual pre-processing is required: the detection algorithm is able to confirm the presence of the watermark with only the attacked image. The algorithm is shown to be moderately resistant to a large number of attacks including compression, cropping and rotation</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/370</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of new benzo[b]thiophene amide-based antimicrobial agents</field><field name="creator">Mbere, Johana M</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this project was to investigate the synthesis and activity of a range of compounds based on the benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxamide structural motif as potential new antimalarial agents, and to a lesser extent as antibacterial agents.In order to subsequently explore any structure-biological activity relationships, the first part of the project involved the systematic synthesis of some 39 non-fused substituted benzo[b]thiophene amide derivatives including tetrahydroisoquinolines, tetrahydro-&#946;-carbolines, dihydropyrroles, piperazines, piperidines and other bridged ring systems as part of the amide-nitrogen component. Methods for the synthesis of the new amide derivatives were developed based on benzo[b]thiophene acid chloride and amine reactions, or on dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-mediated carboxylic acid amine coupling reactions.Further substitution reactions were also undertaken on tetrahydro-&#946;-carboline amides (55, 56, and 57) with the introduction of an N-benzyl group and an N-onitrobenzyl group in the case of 55. The N-boc protected piperazine amide 63 also served as a precursor for other N-substituted piperazine amide derivatives. A single crystal X-ray structure on amides 63 and 73 confirmed the amide rotamer geometry in the solid state with these compounds.The second part of the project incorporated the synthesis of fused analogues which were more conformationally restricted while still retaining the benzo[b]thiophene amide structural motif. A new free radical cyclisation approach to the benzo[b]thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-1-one system in compound 92 was developed, together with the corresponding model isoquinolinone analogue 95. The reaction was based on the use of tributyltin hydride and AIBN to produce the required free radical intermediate from an arylbromide precursor.The free radical cyclisation reaction was extended to synthesise N-benzyl and substituted N-benzyl analogues of 92. The dihydroxylation of the N-allyl substituent in 92 was achieved using potassium osmate and N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO). A further free radical cyclisation route to the N-benzo[b]thien-2-oyl derivatives 112 was also achieved.The synthesis of the novel 9-membered ring containing fused derivatives 120 and 121 was also achieved. This synthesis involved ring closing metathesis methodology using the bis-allyl amides 118 and 119 and Grubbs&#8217; I ruthenium catalyst. The polymer supported version of this catalyst gave better yields of the cyclisation products. A single crystal X-ray structure of 120 confirmed the cis geometry of the double bond in the 9-membered ring. In the course of preparing the required precursor 119 for the 9-membered ring synthesis, a new imine allylation reagent combination was discovered involving zinc, allyltributyltin and boron trifluoride etherate. This reaction is worthy of further investigation to determine its wider synthetic utility.Ring closing metathesis reactions also afforded the dihydropyrrole amides 113 and 114 in good yields.A palladium-mediated cyclisation approach to the new benzo[b]thieno[2,3- c]pyrrolo[2,3-a]indol-11-one system in 126 was also accomplished based on the Nacylindoles 124 and 125.A number of the compounds were tested for their possible in vitro antimalarial activity against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum (K1 CB1 and TM4/ 8.2) and two active leads, the benzo[b]thienoquinolinone derivatives 95 and 102, were discovered. Some potential structure-activity trends for the tested benzo[b]thiophene derivatives were observed (Chapter 4).Antibacterial testing of a few benzo[b]thiophene compounds against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium strains was also done, and the benzo[b]thienoquinolinone derivative 92 exhibited promising activity against Staphylococcus aureus.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/396</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining quality services in Thai accredited hospitals in a climate of economic uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Sitakalin, Panee</field><field name="description">In 1997, Thailand suffered a severe economic downturn. The government was obliged to control health spending whilst also attempting to maintain the quality of hospital services. In the same year, the Thailand Hospital Accreditation Program (HA-Thai) was established. This built on earlier accreditation schemes, and an initial group of thirty-five public and private hospitals joined the program. This study explores the strategies the managers of these 35 hospitals used to maintain the quality of their services since the economic downturn. It also investigated the managers&#8217; perception and understanding of the Hospital Accreditation Program. Little is currently known about the use of quality management within Thai hospitals. The aim of this study was to provide evidence of how hospital quality management was being implemented and how its practices were affected by the economic crisis.The study used a mixed method approach. This was felt to be appropriate given the little that was known about quality management in Thai hospitals. Baseline data were collected by a survey questionnaire. This collected data on which components of Total Quality Management (TQM) were used by the thirty-five hospitals. The hospitals were also requested to provide their strategic plans (or other planning documentation) and their financial reports or annual budgets between 1996-1999. Finally, interviews were conducted with thirty-two top and middle managers from four public hospitals in different provinces and of different size. Public hospitals were selected because they had less access to alternative means of funding than private hospitals and, therefore, their quality programs may have been affected more by the economic downturn.The survey questionnaire was returned by 28 hospitals (80%) in the HA Thai program. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess whether quality management activity was related to public/private status, hospital size, location and whether the hospital was fully or partially accredited. The small sample size lacked sufficient power to identify any statistically significant relationships. Nonetheless, various features were noticeable in the responses of the hospitals. Many had adopted core aspects of TQM, including the communication of the quality management principles, extensive training for various categories of staff, a customer focus, and a broad involvement of staff in hospital decision making. Fewer had strategic plans that included quality, and over half of those hospitals responding thought TQM was an adjunct to management practices rather than being fully integrated. Few hospitals used quality costing, or appeared to understand the concept.All respondents reported collecting data on quality performance from either patient and staff surveys (or both), as well as using customer complaints. These data were primarily used to improve performance in specific areas, but none seemed to use widespread statistical monitoring. Eight hospitals reported benchmarking their services. Nursing and administrative tasks were most involved in implementing quality programs. But despite this, the perceived success of the TQM initiatives was limited. No hospital reported a decline in costs, average length of stay, customer complaints, or number of re-admissions. This may have been linked to barriers that the hospitals reported to TQM implementation. Some hospitals reported that it was too expensive, did not have support of key personnel, or had found that information was either not available or too difficult to obtain. These were consistent with problems reported in other studies but may also reflect the difficult financial circumstances that the hospitals were operating under.The 32 interviewed managers provided greater insight into their approach to quality management. They revealed that each of the four hospitals implemented quality strategies, including joining the HA-Thai program as a way to maintain quality during the economic downturn. The strategies increased the public recognition of the hospitals and were regarded as helping the hospitals cut costs while maintaining quality. The CEOs were regarded as being the main quality instigator. Nonetheless, there were many uncertainties for hospital staff, notably job security. Increased workloads from new quality related administration and increased patient demand, fewer resources and decreased training opportunities were common experiences. The clinical managers had some concerns about the appropriateness of the HA-Thai program for clinical services, and doctors were reported to be apprehensive, feeling they had not been consulted. Doctors also believed they were already providing a quality service. Overall, the managers thought the benefits outweighed the difficulties involved in setting up the program.The analysis of strategic plans was fairly limited. The survey responses suggested that 16 hospitals had strategic plans, and nine hospitals submitted planning documents. Not all documents were complete and many did not contain an internal/external analysis of the hospital&#8217;s operating environment. Yet, all plans were produced in 1997 or after, demonstrating their importance to senior management. Moreover, several contained objectives that directly related to the economic crisis.All hospitals made some mention of quality in their plans, but it is quite limited for several hospitals. All but two hospitals mentioned training, although it is unclear whether there was more or less than before the crisis. This seems to show a commitment to quality improvement as the direct effect of training is difficult to quantify. Another common quality initiative was to apply for ISO9002 accreditation. This also indicated a strong quality focus because the ISO9002 scheme involves extensive documentation and its implementation is likely to increase costs.What the plans did not contain was also interesting. None of the plans reflected a complete &#8220;customer focus&#8221;. This was demonstrated by a lack of commitment to consulting with the local community and only a few plans contained strategies to involve customers or staff. Other aspects of TQM that were not mentioned included quality costing, and benchmarking.Unfortunately, the final aspect of the analysis provided little insight. Few hospitals supplied financial reports, possibly for commercial/privacy reasons. Moreover, the information in the supplied documents was not sufficiently consistent nor detailed to determine how the economic crisis affected individual hospitals.In conclusion, the study findings suggest that these 35 Thai hospitals maintained a commitment to quality management during the economic crisis. Managers appear to be convinced of the long term benefits, and are prepared to work through the difficulties of implementation, including some staff dissatisfaction and an apparent lack of measurable benefits. Despite the economic downturn, the hospitals continued to adopt various quality initiatives, involving mainly nursing and administrative staff. They also continued to provide quality training. In other areas, the use of TQM principles seemed less developed. The study did not identify examples of statistical monitoring, or the use of quality costing. In relation to the HA-Thai accreditation program, the managers were convinced that external accreditation was required to ensure the reputation of their organisation in the community. The managers did not view it uncritically, however, and suggested that it needed to increase transparency and clarity of instructions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/426</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing online learning environments for local contexts, as exemplified in the Sultanate of Oman</field><field name="creator">Hall, Andrea</field><field name="description">Online learning has a significant role in teaching and learning as it can be used to address the issues of quality and access to learning in higher education. However, for online learning to provide an effective solution, it needs to be designed to meet the learning needs of the students. This includes the consideration of their cultural preferences, as it is generally presumed that these significantly affect how people learn, and consequently affect learning success if courses are not designed appropriately.This is particularly important for the Sultanate of Oman, the focus of this study. Since Oman's renaissance in 1970, it has made impressive steps in the development of its education system from a mere three schools in 1970 to over a thousand in 2006 including over 20 higher education colleges and universities; but still faces the challenges of providing sufficient higher education and of sufficient quality for its rapidly expanding student population. If online learning is to be used to respond to these challenges, then the effect of cultural values and preferences must be considered in the way that learning is designed. However, there is little in the literature on how people in this culture learn, how they learn online, and how learning may be designed in a culturally-suitable manner. This is the problem investigated in the research: if culture does impact learning, how can learning be designed in a way that considers cultural values, and enables a successful learning experience? This thesis describes the development and refinement of design principles as an effective means to design culturally appropriate learning environments for higher education in the Sultanate of Oman.A Design-based Research approach was selected to for this study, as it can be used to develop a design solution that has been tested and refined in a genuine learning context, thus making the solution more useable and robust. This approach begins with the identification of the teaching and learning problem, then the proposal of a draft design solution from a literature review. This is followed with iterative testing in a genuine context, so that the theory is informed and modified in the learning environment. The final stage is the production of refined design guidelines and a modified learning environment that is specific for the context where it was tested.In this investigation, existing design models and principles were identified in the literature. These were used to develop design criteria to guide in the development of a design solution. From the literature review, concepts from Vygotsky&#8217;s sociocultural theory were extracted for the design solution as they were found to meet the design criteria more effectively than any other theories that were examined. The five online learning themes of social presence, interaction, collaboration, cognitive strategies, and student-centred learning were identified as a means to apply these theories to the learning design, and it was also found that these theories could be used to explain and verify cultural aspects of the learning design.From this theoretical basis, design guidelines were proposed for a specific context. The five online themes were used as a framework to develop guidelines that were developed from a literature review of learners&#8217; responses to the online environment. Cultural theories were also used to identify worldview and values of the Arabic society so that learning preferences and guidelines could be created for learners with this background. The guidelines were then used to develop an online course, and these became the prototype design solution. This solution was tested iteratively in a context in the Sultanate of Oman, using a case study strategy, during two three month online professional development courses for university faculty. During each research cycle, data analysis was used to modify the design guidelines which then were used to modify the learning environment. This resulted in the development of design guidelines modified by practice and a learning environment modified by theory. Iterative research ensured that the design guidelines continued to shape the learning environment and that this practical context continued to modify and adapt the theory so that with each cycle of research, both the guidelines and the learning environment became more culturally suitable for these particular learners.It was found that the refined guidelines developed in this research were consistent with, and extended, the existing models they built on. They were also able to apply cultural preferences to the design of the learning environment which became increasingly suitable for learners from an Oman cultural background. This provides convincing evidence that this research has provided an effective design solution for culturally appropriate learning design, and for the Sultanate of Oman, where the teaching and learning challenge was identified. It was also found that culture does impact learning significantly, and this emphasises the necessity of using design principles that account for culture and enable the challenges of quality and access to be met more effectively.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/272</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlation with the hermite series using artificial neural network technology</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the correlation of Hermite functions in the form of a Hermite neural network. The terminology &#8220;Hermite neural network&#8221; describes the Hermite series of orthonormal functions, which have been generalized to include numerical algorithms that are often associated with artificial neural networks. The aim of the investigation was to determine whether there are any benefits over the traditional correlation method using Fourier functions. The relative performance of the Hermite neural network correlator was compared to a Fourier neural network correlator. The main result is that the correlation of a Hermite neural network is a summation of NxN associated Laguerre functions whereas a Fourier neural network correlation is a summation of N Fourier functions. In this regard the Fourier neural network will be more efficient for the general correlation of functions. An exception occurs for the correlation of the Hermite neural network with a Gaussian function, or with the CHIRP radar signal. For these signals the correlation is also a summation of N terms. In these applications the Hermite correlator proved to be superior to the Fourier correlator for the following reasons. &#8226; It does not suffer from a circular correlation error, which is a characteristic of the Fourier correlator. &#8226; It allows the Gaussian inverse correlation to be computed without the numerical instability that occurs with a Fourier correlator. &#8226; It achieves a more compact signal interpolation for the CHIRP radar signal correlator than is possible with a Fourier correlator. The relatively good performance of the Hermite correlation, particularly the numerical stability of the inverse correlation, can be expected to be a useful asset for image processing, where the Gaussian function is especially important. As a digression from the main topic of Hermite neural network correlation, during the investigation a new method of fast training the sigmoid neural network was discovered. The principle of the new training method is that it trains the sigmoid neural network to the rate of change of the unknown non-linear function rather than to the function itself. This allows the sigmoid neural network to be trained with an associated radial basis neural network with the speed that is inherent with this type of network. In tests the associated training method was 100 times faster than the conventional training method for the sigmoid neural network. The new training method can be expected to widen the application of the sigmoid neural network to include applications that have previously not been possible on account of the slow training.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/360</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a new silicon based detector module for PET</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Peter R</field><field name="description">In the quest to develop high spatial resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET), the goal of this work is to characterise the innovative silicon detector array that forms the foundation of a new PET detector module design. The new detector module circumvents the current requirement for photomultiplier tubes by the implementation of its solidstate detector analogues. The detector module is based upon pixelated scintillation crystals optically coupled to custom designed silicon 8x8 photodiode arrays and read out by a 128 channel low noise charge sensitive preamp. Each element pad of the array has an active area of 3x3 mm2 and, for the work described in this thesis, is coupled via a fan-out connection system to the testing instrumentation. The testing instrumentation included I(V), optical excitation and nuclear spectroscopy (alpha particle and gamma ray spectroscopy). This work fits in as part of a larger project to provide proof of principle of this new PET detector module design. The dark current of individual pixel elements of an unbonded array was found to be 460 pA at an operating bias voltage of 40 V. To investigate uniformity of response across the array, three different methods have been used. Spectroscopy response on the photopeak of 137Cs in the case of optical coupling of each pixel with 3x3x3 mm3 CsI(Tl) showed uniformity of collected charge of &#177;28%. Investigation of direct response of pixels across the array with 59.9 keV X-rays from 241Am source demonstrated excellent response. To investigate the variation in uniformity of the detector pixel, the optical response of the array was measured using a laser diode (spot size of ~50 &#956;m) and was found to be &#177;12%. The uniformity of a single pixel element response using scanning optical beam was measured to be &#177;1%. Initial characterisation of 3x3 mm2 diode taken from the same wafer used to create the array was optically coupled to a 4x4x10 mm3 LSO scintillator and then to a 3x3x3 mm3 CsI(Tl) scintillator and irradiated by 511 keV and 1.2 MeV gammas from 22Na and 662 keV gammas from 137Cs sources. The energy resolution for the LSO was shown to be 28.8% FWHM for 511 keV and 16.5% for the 662 keV gammas. And the energy resolution for the CsI(Tl) scintillator crystal was 9.5% FWHM for the 511 keV gammas and 7.7% FWHM for the 662 keV gammas. The time properties of this array were tested with coincidence techniques using current pulses from the front and back &#8211; side of the array. For modelling of charge induced in a pixel from LSO photons, in the case of 511 keV photopeak, we used low energy alpha particles generating the same amount of charge. The FWHM of the time spectra was found to be about 700 ps resulting mostly from noise and statistics of charge collection. This specially developed Si pixel array photodiode was demonstrated to satisfy the critical technical parameters required for high resolution PET scanners. Further work has been recommended for stabilisation the sensitive area of pixel to avoid increasing reverse current due to optical coupling. A special optical adhesive has been proposed to avoid this affect.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/362</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of clusterin (CLU) in extracellular protein folding quality control</field><field name="creator">Wyatt, Amy Ruth</field><field name="description">Processes to attain and maintain the correct three-dimensional shape, known as the native conformation, of proteins are vital. However, certain conditions including thermal and oxidative stress may cause proteins to partially unfold and aggregate.  Intracellular and/or extracellular protein aggregates have been identified in a large number of diseases, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, arthritis and type II diabetes. While intracellular quality control for the folding state of proteins is well characterized, corresponding mechanisms for extracellular protein folding quality control have yet to be described.Clusterin (CLU) is an abundant extracellular chaperone that can stabilize proteins and prevent their precipitation during exposure to elevated temperatures or oxidative stress in vitro. The work described here demonstrates that CLU stabilizes stressed client proteins by forming soluble, high molecular weight (HMW) complexes with them. The maximum loading of CLU appears to be at a mass ratio of CLU:stressed client protein of approximately 1:2 (irrespective of the identity of the client protein or the temperature used to induce heat stress). It was demonstrated that various human plasma proteins show increased association with CLU after plasma is subjected to mild shear stress or oxidative stress at 37&#176;C - the most abundant of these was fibrinogen (FGN) which co-purified with CLU from stressed plasma. In vitro, using purified proteins, heat stress of 45&#176;C for 12 h was required to induce FGN precipitation and the formation of HMW CLU-FGN complexes. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of the stressed plasma suggested that a portion of the complexes formed in plasma between CLU and FGN may be similar in mass to those formed in vitro.Using surface plasmon resonance, although CLU was found to bind to megalin, only minimal (or no) binding of HMW complexes formed between CLU and glutathione-S-transferase, citrate synthase or lysozyme was detected. Similarly, negligible binding of these complexes to low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily members expressed on the surface of the rat yolk sac cell line BN was detected. However, the complexes were shown to preferentially bind to the surface of BN cells, peripheral human monocytes and rat hepatocytes (more so than uncomplexed CLU or client proteins). In all cases, this binding was inhibited by fucoidin (a scavenger receptor inhibitor). Confocal microscopy suggested that binding of HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes to the surface of BN cells or rat hepatocytes was followed by their internalization into lysosomes. Furthermore, Western blotting showed that hepatocytes were able to degrade the HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes and that the degradation was almost completely abolished by inhibiting lysosomal proteases with chloroquine. The results of in vivo biodistribution studies in Sprague Dawley rats were highly consistent for several different HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes. Intravenous 123I-labelled HMW CLU-stressed protein complexes were cleared more efficiently from circulation compared to free CLU and the uncomplexed client proteins. The liver and to a lesser degree the spleen appeared to be the key organs responsible for the uptake of complexes and this uptake was inhibited by pre-injection of the animals with fucoidin.The findings of this study suggest an important role for CLU in global quality control of extracellular protein folding. It appears likely that stressed (partially unfolded) extracellular proteins are stabilized and held in solution by CLU and that CLU-stressed protein complexes are subsequently taken up by fucoidin-inhibitable cell surface receptors for subsequent degradation within lysosomes. The precise physical characteristic or binding site that targets CLU-stressed protein complexes for receptor mediated uptake remains to be identified and further work is needed to determine the particular receptor(s) involved. The findings of this study support a model in which complexation with CLU is an important first step in the targeted disposal of stressed proteins via scavenger-like endocytic receptors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/860</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's regulation of commercial use of wildlife: an absence of eco-logic</field><field name="creator">Tucker, Linda L</field><field name="description">Environmental law responds to a vast array of stakeholders at both the domestic and international level. Where it relates to the often controversial area of the regulation of commercial trade in wildlife, the law is subject to the push and pull of different views about what is &#8216;acceptable&#8217; use. Given that these views can be diametrically opposed, depending on the stakeholder or society, the regulation of wildlife trade provides a compelling example of the way philosophical, cultural, political and economic, as well as ecological, concerns find their way into the hearts and minds of legal decision makers. This thesis draws on the international experience concerning commercial use of wildlife but its focus is the approach of Australia&#8217;s federal legislature to regulation of the trade. The purpose of my research is to show that significant developments in international environmental law, leading to more widespread acknowledgement of the potential conservation benefits of commercial use of wildlife, have not infiltrated the Australian wildlife regime. I demonstrate this by a focus on what I consider are illogical constraints on Australia&#8217;s commercial use of wildlife. Initially environmental law met commercial use of wildlife head on with strict prohibitions on trade. This approach has evolved significantly to the extent that it is now widely accepted that commercial consumptive use of wildlife is a potential conservation tool. The bulk of the world&#8217;s remaining wildlife exists in developing countries and a prohibitionist approach, often imposed from afar, does not necessarily engage with the cultural, economic and ecological interests of those rural and remote communities in closest proximity to wildlife. Protection has therefore been recharacterised as simply another tool alongside conservation via sustainable use (&#8216;CSU&#8217;). This acknowledges that environmental management occurs within a world of use and where the greatest threat to wildlife is the loss of habitat such that conservation must compete with financially lucrative but highly destructive uses of the environment. In this context, sustainable use may provide an incentive that competes with more destructive alternative uses. iv To illustrate that environmental law may be a social, cultural and political construct as much as it is a response to conservation imperatives, my analysis required examination of a range of influences on the design and implementation of the Australian regime. The thesis begins by working through contributions from conservation biology, philosophy, cultural and political critiques, empirical studies and international and domestic policy documents. These chapters then provide the groundwork for the legal critique which comprises an examination of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (&#8216;CITES&#8217;) and the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)(&#8216;EPBC Act&#8217;). The evolution in the international debate is reflected in the implementation of CITES which has moved from a protectionist regime, concerned with &#8216;threats&#8217; from trade, towards greater accommodation of the CSU approach. The Australian regime has not responded to these developments, however, and the EPBC Act&#8217;s wildlife trade provisions &#8211; which came into force in 2001 &#8211; have hardly deviated from the legislation they replaced, the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 (Cth). I then demonstrate both the protectionist focus and the selectivity of the Australian regime by way of an examination of the Commonwealth&#8217;s approach to live commercial exports of native animals and the international movement of hunting trophies. For decades there has been a prohibition on the commercial export of live terrestrial vertebrates, in the face of ongoing calls to allow, at least on a trial basis, the export of native birds and reptiles for the international pet trade. Successive federal governments have refused to budge on this issue, despite the fact that: i. native Australian animals, particularly birds, have already made their way into the international trade, as bred and exported by other countries; ii. Australia at the same time allows the live commercial export of other native fauna, particularly lobsters but also insect and aquatic pets; and iii. there is a thriving domestic trade in live birds and reptiles between Australia&#8217;s states and territories. The second case study, on the federal prohibitionist approach to international movement of hunting trophies, is even more at odds with international conservation thinking. Sport v or safari hunting may present as an unacceptable use of wildlife to many in Australian society yet it is highly lucrative and has been embraced in many countries by those marginal rural communities which manage species attractive to sports hunters. It is also proposed as a viable industry for remote indigenous communities in Australia. The case studies show that the prohibitionist approach is clearly favoured in Australia as the most politically acceptable as no effort has been made to explain or justify the legislative and policy inconsistencies. Proponents of greater use of wildlife, however, have significant hurdles to overcome, not least an application of the precautionary principle that does not sit easily with the concept of relative threats to biodiversity, which is the basis of CSU. The thesis concludes that the influence of non-ecological imperatives have held sway, given the arbitrary divide in protective measures for wildlife that conflicts with not only significant international policy and commentary but the findings of every Australian parliamentary inquiry into the issue. A potential conservation tool for Australia, particularly its more marginal landscapes, is being sidelined by the reluctance of decision makers to engage with commercial use of wildlife in a robust manner. I wish to emphasise, however, that whether CSU could be a positive player in Australian environmental management is not the primary concern of the thesis; my focus is on how environmental legislation can be subject to forces that have no apparent grounding in conservation concerns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/789</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The changing context of tertiary English teaching in China and teachers' responses to the challenges</field><field name="creator">Gao, Lianli Clara</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine changes in tertiary English teaching in China and the perceptions and reactions of university English teachers, administrators and policy-makers to these changes. In particular, the study focused on the tension between policy and reality in the areas of curriculum, pedagogy and assessment in Chinese university English teaching. The key research question, therefore, related to how tertiary English teachers are meeting the challenges of the changing expectations of their profession, taking into account the complex context of tertiary English teaching in China with its characteristic historical, cultural, economic and political issues.  Different from most other research in this field in China, the study adopted a sociocultural perspective, using Bourdieu&#8217;s (1971b; 1984) notion of &#8216;field&#8217; and Bernstein&#8217;s (1990; 2000) &#8216;three message systems&#8217; to diagnose the expectations placed on English instructors as a result of changes in what to teach (curriculum), how to teach (pedagogy), and how to assess (assessment and evaluation). The study, finally, was organized around the principles of temporality, autonomy, and specialisation (Maton, 2004a, 2005) to identify teachers&#8217; and administrators&#8217; orientation to change, the degree of autonomy conferred by the changes and the specialist knowledge needed to respond to the changes.  A qualitative inquiry approach was adopted to explore thick and authentic data from a variety of sources, including policy documents, university syllabi, course designs, textbooks, assessment instruments, surveys, and interviews with teachers, administrators and policy-makers.  It was found that, although there is a great recognition of the need for reform, attempts have so far been ineffective because: - policy appears to be inconsistent and unclear in its theoretical basis; - the universities tend not to play a mediating role in interpreting national policy at   the local level, leaving teachers to fall back on what is familiar; - there is a lack of adequate pre-service training for English language instructors in   the areas of ELT curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment, and a lack of sufficient in   service professional development for further understanding and implementing policy   in their teaching; - textbooks and external examinations dominate tertiary English teaching, inhibiting   change; - as a result, university English language instruction is in a state of inertia and English   language instructors are feeling confused and uncertain.  The study argues that power over university English language education remains centralised despite the apparent policy mandate to devolve autonomy in curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment to the universities and university English language instructors do not have the necessary background and experience in language education to assume autonomy or implement reform.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/981</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of fluidised dense-phase pneumatic conveying of powders</field><field name="creator">Mallick, Soumya Suddha</field><field name="description">Dense-phase pneumatic conveying of powders is becoming increasingly popular in various industries such as power, pharmaceutical, cement, alumina, chemical, limestone, refinery, and so on. Some of the reasons include: minimum gas flows and power consumption; improved product quality; increased workplace safety. However, due to the highly concentrated and turbulent mode of the solids-gas flow, only limited progress has been be achieved so far in understanding the fundamental transport mechanisms and accurately predicting pipeline pressure drop, which is a key system design parameter. This thesis aims to overcome the present limitations and provide the industry with a new validated modelling procedure for the accurate prediction and scale-up of pressure drop and optimal operating conditions for fluidised dense-phase pneumatic conveying systems.Various popular/existing models (and model formats) for solids friction (for straight horizontal pipes) have been evaluated for scale-up accuracy and stability. It has been found that the models (and their use of parameter groupings) are generally not capable of accurately predicting pressure drop under scale-up conditions of pipeline diameter and/or length. Two new approaches and another method based on the parameters used by other researcher have been employed in this study as improved design techniques. One approach, derived by modifying an existing reliable dilute-phase model to make it suitable for dense-phase, has resulted in a substantial relative improvement in the overall accuracy of  predictions under scale-up conditions for two types of fly ash, ESP dust, pulverised coal and fly ash/cement mixture. Another method has been derived using the concept of &#8220;two-layer&#8221; slurry flow modelling (i.e. suspension flow occurring on top of a non-suspension moving layer), and this has also resulted in similar improvements. The third method, using parameters that were mentioned by another researcher as providing better representation of the flow phenomenon, has also resulted in similar reliable predictions.  Three different popular/existing bend models have been evaluated to select an optimal (bend loss) model for dense-phase powder conveying. It has been found that the estimation of bend pressure drop can have a considerable impact towards correctly predicting the total pressure loss in a pneumatic conveying system.An existing method of representing &#8220;minimum transport criteria&#8221; (based on superficial air velocity and solids loading ratio) has been found inadequate for predicting the unstable boundary, especially under diameter scale-up conditions. Based on the experimental data of various powders conveyed over a wide range of pipe lengths and diameters, it is found that with increase in pipe diameter, the requirement of minimum conveying air velocity increases. To capture the pipe diameter effect, a Froude number based approach has been introduced to reliably represent the minimum transport boundary.The thesis also investigates the suitability of using a direct differential pressure (DP) measurement technique across a straight length of pipe for fine powder conveying in dense-phase. Standard Deviations (SD) of the DP, as well as the static pressure signals are presented. The trend shows the SD values are increasing with increase in pipe length from pipe inlet to exit (i.e. a dependence on tapping location).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3077</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shadows of another dimension: a bridge between mathematician and artist</field><field name="creator">Humphreys, Janelle Robyn</field><field name="description">The fundamental idea that provides a pathway through this exegesis is the M&#246;bius strip.  It is examined in relation to the mathematical influences on my art practice and consequently identified in the work of the Australian Modernists.  The other key link is the &#8220;bridge.&#8221;  The aim is to &#8220;bridge the gap&#8221; between my roles as artist and mathematician through an analysis of the making process of my painting and sculptures.  Further, I establish a visual link between the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the M&#246;bius strip and Australian modernist paintings.The M&#246;bius strip is introduced as a model for the paintings of William Robinson, contemporary Australian landscape painter.  The M&#246;bius strip is further established as a three-dimensional cross-section of the four-dimensional Klein bottle.  It is the discussion of the similarities between shadows, cross-sections, and projections in relation to my practice which facilitates the understanding of the link between the M&#246;bius strip and the fourth dimension. My art practice is examined in relation to several mathematical properties including space-time sequences, systems of rules, non-Euclidean grids, transformations and the topology of the M&#246;bius strip.  Of particular importance in this analysis is the idea of the projection from one dimension to another and the associated connection to the properties of the M&#246;bius strip.  The relationship between the Sydney Harbour Bridge imagery and the M&#246;bius imagery is the final link forging the connection between the Australian Modernists and the M&#246;bius strip.  The M&#246;bius strip trope is identified in several modernist Australian paintings including paintings of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.  Subsequently, the influence of the fourth dimension and non-Euclidean geometry on Australian Modernism filtering through from the northern hemisphere is established.  The understanding of the relationship between the M&#246;bius strip and the fourth dimension gleaned from my art practice was instrumental in detecting this mathematical influence on the Australian Modernists.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3079</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of antipsychotic drugs on the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the rat brain</field><field name="creator">Han, Mei</field><field name="description">Currently, the control of schizophrenia symptoms is primarily through pharmacological intervention. However, antipsychotics can cause several side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and body weight gain/obesity, which severely affect patient compliance to continue with medication. In addition, due to the effects of antipsychotics on neurotransmission, it is unclear whether central pathological changes observed in post-mortem tissue in schizophrenia are the real pathology of the disease or are a result of the effects of antipsychotic drugs. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the pharmacological efficacy and side-effects of antipsychotic drugs. To achieve this aim, this study examined the expression of dopamine D2, histamine H1, serotonin 5HT1A and muscarinic M1 receptors in the rat brain following short-term (1 week) and long-term (12 weeks) treatment with aripiprazole, olanzapine and haloperidol.Aripiprazole and haloperidol both have a high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, however aripiprazole has a lower risk of EPS than haloperidol. The aim of Chapter 2 was to understand the mechanism underlying why aripiprazole, unlike haloperidol, has a therapeutic effect but does not induce significant EPS. Results showed that aripiprazole selectively increased D2 receptor mRNA expression and decreased tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression (TH; a rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of dopamine) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not the substantia nigra (SN). Aripiprazole also decreased dopamine transporter (DAT) binding density in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and VTA. Consistent with previous findings, haloperidol significantly increased D2 receptor binding density, but decreased DAT binding density in the NAc, CPu and VTA. Olanzapine had less widespread effects on D2 receptor expression and DAT binding density. These results suggest that aripiprazole may control schizophrenia symptoms through a novel mechanism: that is, by selectively reducing dopamine synthesis in the VTA but not SN. This may contribute to the long-term efficacy of aripiprazole in controlling schizophrenia symptoms with reduced EPS.It has been previously reported that aripiprazole and olanzapine increased dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex via the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, which may partially explain why these drugs can improve the negative symptoms and cognitive functional deficits associated with schizophrenia. It is interesting that aripiprazole has a high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors, but olanzapine has not. Therefore, the aim of Chapter 3 was to examine whether these antipsychotics affect 5-HT1A receptor expression. The results showed that aripiprazole increased 5-HT1A binding density in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and medial posterodorsal nuclei of the posterior amygdala (MeP), while olanzapine down- regulated the binding density of 5-HT1A receptors in the cingulate cortex. However, these changes were not apparent after 12 weeks of drug treatment. This study suggests that aripiprazole and olanzapine have different effects on the binding density of 5-HT1A receptors. The results indicate that aripiprazole and olanzapine have differential effects on 5-HT1A protein expression, which may contribute to their distinct profiles in improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. However, they may induce adaptation and desensitisation in serotonin 5-HT1A receptor expression after long-term treatment.Schizophrenia patients exhibit a decrease, or no change, in muscarinc M1 receptor expression in certain brain regions. Olanzapine has a high affinity for the M1 receptor, while aripiprazole and haloperidol have low affinities. The aim of Chapter 4 was to investigate how these antipsychotics affect M1 receptor mRNA expression in regions of the brain that are implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia. This study showed that the three antipsychotics increased M1 receptor mRNA expression in the hippocampus. In addition, increases in M1 receptor mRNA expression were also observed in the SN following treatment with haloperidol and olanzapine, and in the NAc following treatment with aripiprazole. These results suggest that alterations of M1 receptor mRNA expression in schizophrenia are unlikely to be a consequence of drug treatment, and implicate the muscarinic M1 receptor as a contributor to the therapeutic effects of schizophrenia treatments.The aim of Chapter 5 was to investigate whether the body weight gain/obesity side-effect of olanzapine was produced by regulating histamine H1 receptor expression. To the best of this author&#8217;s knowledge, this study is the first to compare H1 receptor expression in the rat brain following short and long-term administration of olanzapine, aripiprazole and haloperidol. Results showed that olanzapine significantly down-regulated H1 receptor mRNA expression and binding density in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH), and H1 receptor mRNA expression in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc). Consistent with their low risk of weight gain/obesity side-effect, aripiprazole and haloperidol had no effect on H1 receptor expression in the VMH or Arc. Histamine H1 receptor mRNA expression in the VMH and Arc were negatively correlated to body weight gain and energy efficiency, while H1 receptor mRNA expression in the Arc showed negative correlations to food intake and total fat mass. In addition, there was a negative relationship between H1 receptor binding densities in the VMH and total fat mass and body weight gain. This study suggests that an olanzapine-induced down-regulation of histamine H1 receptor expression in regions of hypothalamus involved in the regulation of food intake (the Arc and VMH) may be a key factor contributing to olanzapine-induced body weight gain/obesity.In conclusion, this study revealed that the effects of antipsychotics on specific neurotransmitter receptors contribute to the mechanisms of their pharmacological efficacy and side-effects. The binding profiles of antipsychotics for specific receptors cannot completely predict the level of their therapeutic efficacies and side-effects. Furthermore, the changes in expression of some receptors (such as 5- HT1A) by antipsychotic treatment may produce the adaptation and desensitisation after long-term use. These results have also provided significant information which may assist with the development of new antipsychotic drugs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/3078</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifetime monitoring of appliances for reuse</field><field name="creator">Mazhar, Muhammad Ilyas, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Environmental awareness and legislative pressures have made manufacturers responsible for the take-back and end-of-life treatment of their products. Therefore, manufacturers are struggling to find ways to recover maximum value from returned products. This goal can best be achieved by promoting multiple reuse programs as reuse is one of the most effective ways to enhance a sustainable engineering economy. Since the essential goal of the reuse strategy is to reuse parts, the reliability of used parts becomes a core issue. Research indicates that reuse is technologically feasible, associated with a significant manufacturing cost saving, and it does not compromise product quality. However, it is not easy to be applied in reality. There are several uncertainties associated with reuse, the most common is the uncertainty of the product???s quality after use. A widespread implementation of the reuse strategy could be triggered, subject to the availability of reliable methods to assess the useful remaining life of parts. The evolution of such a methodology would play a pivotal role in making decisions on the supply chain process and the recovery value of returned products. Reliability assessment by life cycle data analysis is the basis of this research. The proposed methodology addresses the problem of reliability assessment of used parts by considering two important aspects. It performs statistical as well as condition monitoring data analysis for decision-making on reuse. The analysis is carried out in two stages. Firstly, a wellknown reliability assessment procedure, the Weibull analysis, is applied to analyse time-tofailure data to assess the overall reuse potential of components. In the second stage, the used capacity (actual life) of components is determined by analysing their operating history (condition monitoring data). The linear and nonlinear regression analysis, Kriging procedures and artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed in this stage. Finally, the Weibull analysis and ANNs are integrated to estimate the remaining useful life of components/assemblies of a product at the end of its first life cycle.

The primary role play is performed by nine beginner level learners of Japanese studying at an Australian university, but the role play is also performed by ten Japanese native speakers in order to determine what is normative for native speakers in this situation. Unlike previous studies in this area, this research collects kinesic non-verbal data in addition to linguistic data. The data is analysed using Thomas's (1983) concept of pragmatic failure, and Brown and Levinson's (1978, 1987) politeness theory. The study also considers whether Japanese native speakers evenly evaluate the role play performances of the Japanese learners. Despite difficulties in the application of these linguistic theories to beginner level learners, a number of sociopragmatic failures and one pragmalinguistic failure are observed in the role play performances of the Japanese learners. These are partially explained by a lack of instruction, nervousness in performing the role play and the learners' limited proficiency in the Japanese language. Inconsistencies are also observed in the way that JNS participants evaluate the role play performances of the JFL learners.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese language.</field><field name="subject">Interlanguage (Language learning)</field><field name="subject">Pragmatics.</field><field name="subject">Failure (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Students -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27313</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monumental amnesia: reading the spatial narratives written by contemporary urban landscapes.</field><field name="creator">Rozentals, Darien Jane, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">Monumental Amnesia: Reading the Spatial Narratives Written by Contemporary Urban Landscapes This thesis analyses the spatial stories inscribed into urban landscapes by monuments. Differentiating between officially sanctioned, symbolic, and everyday monuments, this thesis theorises the narratological space composed by these objects: static, imagined and transitional, respectively. It argues that monumental sites are spaces of forgetting, rather than remembering, characterised through invisibility, opacity and mystification. Infused with paradox, monuments simultaneously reveal and conceal the histories and urban memories they are expected to commemorate. The discussion then turns to contemporary art, in particular memory installations, as a practice that counters the mystification inherent within urban space, actively exposing alternative pasts and memories. The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first analyses the contemporary, officially sanctioned monuments of Vilnius, Lithuania that celebrate an ancient nationalism, alongside two neighboring sculpture parks that display retired Soviet icons, with a particular focus on Gintaris Karosas?? sculpture Infotree LNK. The second chapter theorises symbolic monuments, and focuses on the Japanese theme park Tobu World Square as a curiosity cabinet where the contemporary spatial practice, identified by Anthony Giddens, of ??disembedding?? is performed in miniature. It concludes with a discussion of Susan Norrie??s DVD installation of the park ENOLA. The third chapter examines everyday monuments, focusing on the industrial ruins of Manchester to unravel the archival aspects of these monuments and their gentrification. It closes with a study of Cornelia Parker??s installation Cold Dark Matter: An Exploded View. Through these urban case studies and accompanying memory installations, the thesis explores how urban monuments disguise certain histories and memories of a city, and how art can reclaim alternative stories and memories from urban amnesia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41245</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating factors that influence carbon dissolution from Coke into Molten iron.</field><field name="creator">Cham, S. Tsuey, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The need for more efficient blast furnaces is even greater now that there are stricter environmental regulations on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Coke within the blast furnace not only supports the furnace bed and allows gas flow, it also carburises liquid iron. The carburisation of iron is one of the most important reactions and must be better understood if the ironmaking process in the blast furnace is to be made more sustainable. By understanding what coke properties influence the rate at which coke dissolves in iron we can predict a coke?s performance and use it to determine its quality.  As carbon dissolution rates have only been determined for a few cokes, a systematic and comprehensive study was conducted on the dissolution of carbon from nine Australian cokes into liquid iron. The kinetics of carbon dissolution from Cokes A to I was measured and a range of experimental techniques were used to elucidate the dominant rate influencing factors. The role of coke structure, coke inorganic matter composition and yield and temperature were investigated. Furthermore, the influence of interfacial products and dynamic wettability studies were also conducted.  The carburiser cover method was used to measure carbon pick-up as a function of time over the temperature range of 1450-1550 ??C. Fundamental data on the apparent carbon dissolution rate constant (K) in molten iron at 1550 ??C for Cokes A to I were obtained and ranged from K (x 103 s-1) = 0.47 to K (x 103 s-1) = 14.7. The wide variation in K showed that not all cokes dissolve at similar rates. In fact one of the nine cokes in this investigation dissolved at a rate comparable to graphite dissolution rates.  The apparent carbon dissolution activation energy, Ea, for two of the nine cokes plus synthetic graphite (SG) was also determined. The Ea obtained for SG (Ea = 54 kJ / mol) was in agreement with literature values and was consistent with a diffusion controlled mechanism. The observed Ea values for Cokes D and F (313 kJ / mol and 479 kJ / mol respectively) are an order of magnitude larger than the Ea obtained for SG. The difference in Ea between cokes and SG does not appear to be solely due to differences in the structure of the carbon source. The difference in Ea between the cokes was attributed to differences in their inorganic matter composition. The interfacial contact area is a function of inorganic matter yield and composition, which in turn is a function of temperature. Therefore, as temperature decreases the slag / ash layer produced at the carbon / iron interface can increase in area and viscosity and thus hinder carbon dissolution and transfer, and increasing the apparent activation energy for carbon dissolution. Thus, the differences in viscosity and melting temperature of the interfacial product play a key role.  Wettability experiments were carried out using the sessile drop technique. The wettability of Cokes D, F and G with liquid iron at 1550 ??C was measured as a function of time. All three coke samples showed non-wetting behaviour with contact angles ranging between 123-129?? in the initial stages and between 109-114?? after two hours of contact. The differences in the wettability of the three coke samples could not explain the large differences in dissolution rates observed between these cokes. Thus, the wettability of these coke samples was not considered a dominant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution.  The sessile drop technique was also used to study the interfacial products formed at the coke / iron interface. The interfacial products formed on the underside of the iron droplet after contact with Cokes F and G were initially different in regards to the morphology and chemical composition. The interfacial product formed with Coke G had a network or mesh like structure that seemed to wet the iron droplet much better than the interfacial product formed with Coke F. In contrast, Fe globules and discrete interfacial products were observed in Coke F. It was suggested that this was due to differences in inorganic matter content, especially in calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) content in the coke.  Formation of interfacial products containing sulfides, such as calcium sulfide (CaS) and manganese sulfide (MnS), were observed on the iron side of the interface of both Cokes F and G. As a result, the interfacial products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution and decreasing the rate of carbon dissolution. The presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product, which in turn can affect the overall viscosity of the interfacial layer. Thus, the deposition of reaction products at the interfacial region can have a significant effect on carbon dissolution rates.  The mineral pyrrhotite was also identified as a significant factor in influencing the rate of carbon dissolution. Electron dispersive X-ray analyses of Coke F identified iron to be in close association with sulfur. These Fe / S species have atomic ratio similar to pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS) or troilite (FeS). Pyrrhotite in coke can decompose to release gaseous sulfur and metallic iron, which can be carburised by carbon in the surrounding area to form Fe-C particles. Thus, carburisation of liquid iron can occur via Fe-C particles.  There was little difference in structure between the nine coke samples and therefore the high dissolution rates of Coke F, cannot be explained on the basis of crystallite size or anisotropic carbon content. Inorganic matter yield and composition were identified as the dominant rate influencing factors on carbon dissolution. More specifically: - High content of iron phases, such as iron oxides and pyrrhotite, can lead to an increase in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to increased amounts of Fe-C particles that are formed upon the reduction of magnetite and decomposition of pyrrhotite, and carried through the slag layer to carburise the bulk liquid iron. - High aluminium oxide content can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. This maybe due to higher ash fusion / melting temperature or decrease in wettability, both of which lead to a decrease in carbon / iron contact area. - Formation of interfacial products, such as CaS and MnS, can lead to a decrease in carbon dissolution rates. Such products can act as a physical barrier blocking iron and coke contact, thus reducing the contact area for carbon dissolution. However, the presence of MnS may act to lower the liquidus temperature of the interfacial product. - An increase in temperature increases the rate of carbon dissolution. This dependence is predominantly due to the composition of the inorganic matter present in cokes, which influences the viscosity and melting point of the interfacial product formed and hence contact area between coke and iron.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liquid iron.</field><field name="subject">Coke -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Carbon.</field><field name="subject">Wetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40685</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the demagnetisation process and possible alternative magnetic treatments for naval vessels</field><field name="creator">Baynes, Timothy Malcolm, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naval submarines and surface ships are regularly subjected to a treatment called &amp;quotdeperming&amp;quot that seeks to design the vessel???s permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate various aspects of the deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A &amp;quotlaboratory MTF&amp;quot was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU200T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ??5%) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU200T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ??0.1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0.94 ??0.09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA2S-E and CU200T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU200T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5.97??10-3 and 0.0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D): redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel &amp;quotanhysteretic deperm&amp;quot method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin???s equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. &amp;quotSympathetic deperming&amp;quot occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (&amp;gt 0.1m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0.5mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Degaussing</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic devices</field><field name="subject">Magnetism of ships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20479</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of bone defect models in immunodeficient animals</field><field name="creator">Gan, Jade Ho Yue, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bone defects resulting from non-unions, fractures, significant revision joint replacements, tumour resection and osteolysis present a clinical problem. While autografts are considered the gold standard, ubiquitous use of this reparative technique is limited by graft supply and site morbidity. Recent progresses in tissue engineering using stem cells, bone enhancing molecules and gene therapy have provided more hypotheses for bone defect treatment. In vivo assessment to test these hypotheses requires animal models to mimic human conditions. Immunodeficient or nude animals have the advantage of hosting materials from human and other xenographic origins without immuno-intolerance or rejection. A thorough understanding of the biology in nude animals is vital for the further advancement of connective tissue healing and regeneration strategies. Nude mice are excellent xenographic hosts for in- vivo characterisation and provide a reproducible animal source. The immune deficiencies of nude compared to normal animals may however, influence bone healing and need to be addressed. This dissertation (a) investigated potential bone defect models in nude mice and nude rats (b) incorporated the selected bone defect model to evaluate the effect of T cell deficiency and age on bone defect healing in nude animals (c) determined the feasibility of a critical size defect (CSD) in nude mice. A distal-femur-condylar-defect (DFCD) model was successfully performed in nude mice and rats. The model was found to have some advantages as a bone defect model: (1) located at a weight-bearing skeletal site (2) no requirements for an internal or external fixator (3) does not obstruct or limit mobility (4) location is not in close proximity to any major organs such as the brain (5) easy identification of surface anatomy (6) defect size is standardised and reproducible (7) does not require lengthy and complicated surgery and (8) cost effective. This dissertation confirmed that bone healing in nude mice is similar to that of normal immunocompetent mice. Absence of T lymphocytes did not delay or inhibit bone repair. Use of older nude mice did not seem to affect the healing rate, in contrast to older normal mice, which showed delay in bone healing in the initial phase. Establishment of critical sized defects in mice at a weight-bearing location was not feasible due to the robust healing of murine. This dissertation recommends that the DFCD model could be utilized for the assessment of xenogenic materials at early time point.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone-grafting</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22429</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guided random-walk based model checking</field><field name="creator">Bui, Hoai Thang, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ever increasing use of computer systems in society brings emergent challenges to companies and system designers. The reliability of software and hardware can be financially critical, and lives can depend on it. The growth in size and complexity of software, and increasing concurrency, compounds the problem. The potential for errors is greater than ever before, and the stakes are higher than ever before. Formal methods, particularly model checking, is an approach that attempts to prove mathematically that a model of the behaviour of a product is correct with respect to certain properties. Certain errors can therefore be proven never to occur in the model. This approach has tremendous potential in system development to provide guarantees of correctness. Unfortunately, in practice, model checking cannot handle the enormous sizes of the models of real-world systems. The reason is that the approach requires an exhaustive search of the model to be conducted. While there are exceptions, in general model checkers are said not to scale well.  In this thesis, we deal with this scaling issue by using a guiding technique that avoids searching areas of the model, which are unlikely to contain errors. This technique is based on a process of model abstraction in which a new, much smaller model is generated that retains certain important model information but discards the rest. This new model is called a heuristic. While model checking using a heuristic as a guide can be extremely effective, in the worst case (when the guide is of no help), it performs the same as exhaustive search, and hence it also does not scale well in all cases.  A second technique is employed to deal with the scaling issue. This technique is based on the concept of random walks. A random walk is simply a `walk' through the model of the system, carried out by selecting states in the model randomly. Such a walk may encounter an error, or it may not. It is a non-exhaustive technique in the sense that only a manageable number of walks are carried out before the search is terminated. This technique cannot replace the conventional model checking as it can never guarantee the correctness of a model. It can however, be a very useful debugging tool because it scales well. From this point of view, it relieves the system designer from the difficult task of dealing with the problem of size in model checking. Using random walks, the effort goes instead into looking for errors.  The effectiveness of model checking can be greatly enhanced if the above two techniques are combined: a random walk is used to search for errors, but the walk is guided by a heuristic. This in a nutshell is the focus of this work. We should emphasise that the random walk approach uses the same formal model as model checking. Furthermore, the same heuristic technique is used to guide the random walk as a guided model checker. Together, guidance and random walks are shown in this work to result in vastly improved performance over conventional model checking. Verification has been sacrificed of course, but the new technique is able to find errors far more quickly, and deal with much larger models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heuristic search</field><field name="subject">Model checking</field><field name="subject">Guided random-walk</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44829</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of mandibular advancement splint therapy on upper airway structure and function in obstructive sleep apnoea</field><field name="creator">Ng, Andrew Tze Ming, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by repetitive closure of the upper airway during sleep and associated with significant adverse health effects including hypertension, heart disease and stroke. Current treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is highly effective but reduced compliance levels have resulted in suboptimal outcomes. Oral appliances such as mandibular advancement splints (MAS) are an alternative treatment and have potential advantages including greater patient compliance, comfort and portability. Although they have been shown to be successful across all categories of OSA severity, overall they are less effective than CPAP. A key limitation to its more widespread use has been the inability to predict which patients will be a treatment success.	Prediction of treatment outcome would greatly enhance both MAS utilization and overall OSA management. However, little is known about the mechanisms of action of MAS therapy and a more detailed understanding is likely to improve patient selection and outcome. The aim of this thesis is to improve the prediction of treatment outcome through improved understanding of the mechanisms and site(s) of action of MAS therapy during sleep, through extrapolating this knowledge into daytime prediction tests and by developing prediction equations which can be tested prospectively. The work in this thesis presents novel ideas and findings. It is the first to examine and find that MAS therapy improves upper airway collapsibility during sleep. The site(s) of upper airway collapse was also examined and found to predict treatment outcome. Primary oropharyngeal collapse during sleep predicted treatment success and this was extrapolated into a simple daytime test hypothesized to reflect oropharyngeal function. These primary oropharyngeal collapsers were found to have characteristic awake flow-volume curves and this was then studied prospectively.

Further, many couples move about on this continuum over the course of the relationship, according to their changing wishes and desires. Making the right choice or transitioning from one relationship style to another is not always straightforward and unproblematic. Some male couples may benefit from therapeutic support at these crucial times.  This research seeks to contribute to knowledge that could inform sensitive and respectful practice on the part of therapists and others who work with the relational concerns of gay men. Using qualitative methodology the research questions explored how gay men negotiate the place of ERS with their partners, the strategies they use to manage ERS, and their beliefs about the effects of their choices on themselves and their relationship. A purposive sample of 24 Sydney gay men (six single and 18 partnered) aged between 22 and 68 participated in the research. Data were collected through semi??structured interviews and subjected to thematic analysis. Despite diverse experiences of ERS, a core set of processes appeared central to relationship satisfaction and function.  The knowledge produced by this research provides a number of ways for therapists to orient themselves to the therapeutic terrain of work with gay men and ERS while remaining alive to the unique and particular characteristics of the male couple relationship before them.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extra-relational sex</field><field name="subject">Gay men</field><field name="subject">Male couples</field><field name="subject">Mononogamy and non- monogamy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44847</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Damage detection in structures using natural frequency measurements</field><field name="creator">Kannappan, Laxmikant, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the last two decades, the emphasis in aircraft maintenance has been on developing online structural health monitoring systems to replace conventional non destructive  inspection techniques which require considerable down-time, human effort and cost. Vibration based damage detection is one of the most promising techniques for implementation in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). In vibration based methods,  the presence of damage is detected by monitoring changes in one of the dynamic  parameters of the structure, resonant frequencies, modeshapes or damping characteristics. Compared to modeshape based methods, frequency based methods have  the advantage that measurements need to be taken only at a single location. Previous developments on frequency based techniques have relied on Finite Element Model updating; analytical techniques have hitherto been restricted to beams due  to the complexity in developing equations for cracked two dimensional structures.  In this thesis the analytical approach using an energy formulation is extended to  plates with through-thickness cracks, where modeshapes from either numerical modelling or experimental measurements can be employed to determine the energy of  vibration. It is demonstrated that by using a hybrid approach, incorporating experimentally measured modeshapes along with measured changes in frequencies,  the damage parameters can be estimated without resorting to theoretical modelling  or numerical analysis. The inverse problem of finding the crack location, size and  orientation from measured changes in frequencies is addressed using minimisation  techniques.  The forward problem and the inverse algorithm is first validated using numerical  simulation and experimental testing of beams with edge cracks and centre cracks.  The application of the methodology to the two dimensional case is then validated by numerical simulation and experimental modal analysis of plates with through thickness cracks. A statistical procedure is developed for determination of the 90/95  probability of crack detection and the minimum detectable crack size in both cases. It is demonstrated that the measurement of frequency changes can be successfully  employed to detect and assess the location and size of cracks in beams and plates, using modeshapes from theory, Finite Element Analysis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vibration (Aeronautics) : Testing</field><field name="subject">Vibration (Aeronautics) : Measurement</field><field name="subject">Airframes : Fatigue : Testing</field><field name="subject">Airplanes : Maintenance and repair.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44852</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hardware-software design methods for security and reliability of MPSoCs</field><field name="creator">Patel, Krutartha , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Security of a Multi-Processor System on Chip (MPSoC) is an emerging area of concern in embedded systems. MPSoC security is jeopardized by Code Injection attacks. Code Injection attacks, which are the most common types of software attacks, have plagued single processor systems. Design of MPSoCs must therefore incorporate security as one of the primary objectives. Code Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in \trusted" and legacy code.  An architecture with a dedicated monitoring processor (MONITOR) is employed to simultaneously supervise the application processors on an MPSoC. The program code in the application processors is divided into basic blocks. The basic blocks in the application processors are statically instrumented with special instructions that allow communication with the MONITOR at runtime. The MONITOR verifies the execution of all the processors at runtime using control flow checks and either a timing or instruction count check.  This thesis proposes a monitoring system called SOFTMON, a design methodology called SHIELD, a design flow called LOCS and an architectural framework called CUFFS for detecting Code Injection attacks. SOFTMON, a software monitoring system, uses a software algorithm in the MONITOR. SOFTMON incurs limited area overheads. However, the runtime performance overhead is quite high. SHIELD, an extension to the work in SOFTMON overcomes the limitation of high runtime overhead using a MONITOR that is predominantly hardware based.  LOCS uses only one special instruction per basic block compared to two, as was the case in SOFTMON and SHIELD. Additionally, profile information is generated for all the basic blocks in all the application processors for the MPSoC designer to tune the design by increasing or decreasing the frequency of loop basic blocks.  CUFFS detects attacks even without application processors communicating to the MONITOR. The SOFTMON, SHIELD and LOCS approaches can only detect attacks if the application processors communicate to the MONITOR. CUFFS relies on the exact number of instructions in basic blocks to determine an attack, rather than time-frame based measures used in SOFTMON, SHIELD and LOCS.  The lowest runtime performance overhead was achieved by LOCS (worst case of 37.5%), while the SOFTMON monitoring system had the least amount of area overheads of about 25%. The CUFFS approach employed an active MONITOR and hence detected a greater range of attacks.  The CUFFS framework also detects bit flip errors (reliability errors) in the control flow instructions of the application processors on an MPSoC. CUFFS can detect nearly 70% of all bit flip errors in the control flow instructions.  Additionally, a modified CUFFS approach is proposed to ensure reliable inter-processor communication on an MPSoC. The modified CUFFS approach uses a hardware based checksum approach for reliable inter-processor communication and incurred a runtime performance overhead of up to 25% and negligible area overheads compared to CUFFS.  Thus, the approaches proposed in this thesis equip an MPSoC designer with tools to embed security features during an MPSoC's design phase. Incorporating security measures at the processor design level provides security against software attacks in MPSoCs and incurs manageable runtime, area and code-size overheads.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">MPSoCs</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Software attacks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44854</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Developmental Evaluation : the Interplay between Evolution and Development</field><field name="creator">Hoang, Tuan-Hoa, Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis was inspired by the difficulties of artificial evolutionary systems in finding elegant and well structured, regular solutions. That is that the solutions found are usually highly disorganized, poorly structured and exhibit limited re-use, resulting in bloat and other problems. This is also true of previous  developmental evolutionary systems, where structural regularity emerges only by  chance. We hypothesise that these problems might be ameliorated by incorporating repeated evaluations on increasingly difficult problems in the course of  a developmental process. This thesis introduces a new technique for learning  complex problems from a family of structured increasingly difficult problems, Evolutionary Developmental Evaluation (EDE). This approach appears to give  more structured, scalable and regular solutions to such families of problems than  previous methods. In addition, the thesis proposes some bio-inspired components  that are required by developmental evolutionary systems to take full advantage of  this approach. The key part of this is the developmental process, in combination  with a varying fitness function evaluated at multiple stages of development, generates selective pressure toward generalisation. This also means that parsimony  in structure is selected for without any direct parsimony pressure. As a result,  the system encourages the emergence of modularity and structural regularity in  solutions.  In this thesis, a new genetic developmental system called Developmental Tree  Adjoining Grammar Guided Genetic Programming (DTAG3P), is implemented,  embodying the requirements above. It is tested on a range of benchmark problems. The results indicate that the method generates more regularly-structured solutions than the competing methods.

Firstly, advection down isopycnal tracer gradients is related to mixing in specific regions of the ocean. Secondly, a general inverse method is developed for estimating both mixing and the general circulation.  Two examples of down gradient advection are explored. Firstly the region of Mediterranean outflow in the North Atlantic. Given a known transport of warm salty water out of the Mediterranean Sea and the mean hydrography of the eastern North Atlantic, the vertical structure of the along-isopycnal mixing coefficient, K, and the vertical mixing coefficient, D, is revealed. Secondly, the Southern Ocean Meridional Overturning Circulation, SMOC, is investigated. There, relatively warm salty water is advected southward, along-isopycnals, toward fresher cooler surface waters. The strength and structure of the SMOC is related to K and D by considering advection down along-isopycnal gradients of temperature and potential vorticity. The ratio of K to D and their magnitudes are identified. A general tool is developed for estimating the ocean circulation and mixing; the \textit{tracer-contour inverse method}. Integrating along contours of constant tracer on isopycnals, differences in a geostrophic streamfunction are related to advection and hence to mixing. This streamfunction is related in the vertical, via an analogous form of the depth integrated thermal wind equation. The tracer-contour inverse method combines aspects of the box, beta spiral and Bernoulli methods. The tracer-contour inverse method is validated against the output of a layered model and against in-situ observations from the eastern North Atlantic. The method accurately reproduces the observed mixing rates and reveals their vertical structure.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inverse Methods</field><field name="subject">Ocean Circulation</field><field name="subject">Ocean Mixing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44872</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of residual non-aqueous phase liquids in porous media subject to freeze-thaw</field><field name="creator">Singh, Kamaljit, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project concerns the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the pore-scale structure of nonaqueous  phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants in water-saturated porous media. This  problem is of critical importance to the entrapment of such contaminants in cold  temperate, polar and high altitude regions, and has not been examined in the literature to  date. This research work is conducted in three stages: (i) two-dimensional nondestructive  visualisation of residual light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), and dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL), in porous media subject to successive freeze-thaw cycles; (ii)  three-dimensional experiments on LNAPL in porous media  subject to freeze-thaw, with quantification of phase volumes by X-ray micro-computed  tomography (micro-CT); and (iii) the explanation of results by several pore scale mathematical and conceptual models. The two-dimensional cell experiments (using a monolayer of 0.5 mm diameter glass beads held between two glass sheets), and three-dimensional X-ray micro-CT experiments reveal a substantial mobilisation and rupture of ganglia  during successive freeze-thaw cycles; this includes the detachment of smaller ganglia from larger ganglia and the mobilisation of NAPL in the direction of freezing front. The experiments also reveal significant shedding of numerous single/sub-singlet ganglia along narrow pore corridors, their entrapment in growing polycrystalline ice, and the coalescence of such small ganglia during thawing to form larger singlets.  These changes were more predominant where the freezing commenced. The results of the experimental studies were interpreted by developing several mathematical and conceptual models, including freezing-induced pressure model, Darcy's law model, multipore ganglia model (rupture coefficient) and ice-snap off model.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermodynamics</field><field name="subject">Nonaqueous phase liquids</field><field name="subject">Dense nonaqueous phase liquids</field><field name="subject">Frozen ground</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Freeze-thaw cycles</field><field name="subject">Pore-scale structure</field><field name="subject">Water-saturated porous media</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44875</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaporated polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells by aluminium-induced crytallization solid-phase epitaxy</field><field name="creator">He, Song, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film solar cells are receiving attention by many researchers in recent times. The focus of this thesis is the evaporated ALICE solar cell, a thin-film poly-Si solar cell fabricated on a glass superstrate by e-beam evaporation. The acronymn ALICE comes from - ALuminium Induced Crystallization Solid Phase Epitaxy. The concept is first to form a high-quality crystalline silicon layer on glass by Aluminium Induced Crystallization (AIC). The AIC seed layer (grain size&gt;20 ??m) acts as the template from which the crystalline information is transferred into the silicon over-layer by solid-phase epitaxy (SPE). As a result, the ALICE solar cells have much larger grain size compared to the poly-Si thin-film solar cell (2~3 ??m) by random nucleation and growth (RNG). This leads to the minimized grain boundary recombination and hence potential improved conversion efficiency. The temperature of 200??C is found to be optimal for the deposition of amorphous Si (a-Si) precursor thin films. The epitaxy process of the ALICE cell is successful, proving the feasibility and reliability of the deposition and post-treatment processes. The ALICE cell is successfully metallized using a bifacial interdigitated scheme. Wet etching using KOH is introduced to realize the uniform Si etching, and phosphoric acid etching is introduced to remove the local shunts in the ALICE cell. The results show that the material quality of ALICE solar cells are much worse than that of the AIC seed layer, which is related to the poor epitaxy quality on (111) planes grown from the AIC seed layer. Additional experiments show that the fraction of (100) oriented grains in AIC is the main factor in determining the material quality and the resulting solar cell performance, rather than grain size. Therefore, both a high fraction of (100) oriented grains and large grain size are required for AIC seed layers to achieve the ALICE solar cells with superior performance. Comparison of the ALICE cells prepared at different base pressures and deposition rates show that the base pressure is much less important than the deposition rate. Therefore, the capital cost of the evaporator system can be reduced and hence potentially the manufacturing cost of solar cells. The densification anneal was introduced to improve the crystal quality of poly-Si thin films by SPE. It is shown that the cause is the structural relaxation induced into the a-Si film, instead of the prevention of the oxygen percolation. The crystal quality of c-Si films obtained from low-rate (50 nm/min) evaporated a-Si is considerably improved by densification anneal, whereas densification has no beneficial effect on c-Si films obtained from high-rate (300 nm/min) evaporated a-Si. However, the densification anneal has no improvement on the electrical performance of ALICE solar cell. The ALICE solar cell performances are strongly related to the doping level in the absorber layer. The optimal doping density needs to be determined to achieve the best performance. The highest Voc and Jsc are simultaneously achieved when the minimum phosphorous doping density of ~5.5??1015 cm-3 (unintentionally doped) is applied for the evaporated ALICE solar cells. Since silicon is a weak absorber and ALICE solar cell has only ~1.5 ??m thickness, light trapping is applied to enhance the light absorption of the visible and the red light. Three different approaches are applied: ALICE cells on textured glass sheet, back surface reflector and thicker Si film. The ALICE cells on textured glass suffer from a significant loss of performance. The only successful approach to improve the light trapping in this thesis is to apply white paint as back surface reflector, which increases the Jsc drastically (~60%) compared to a planar sample. Analysis of the optical properties of poly-Si thin films is important as it assists the design of the thin-film solar cells. It is found that there is enhanced absorption in the visible wavelengths. This is mainly attributed to defected a-Si material at the grain boundaries. The hydrogenation process does not affect this enhanced absorption. The optical analysis proves that large grain size is desired to obtain high performance poly-Si thin-film solar cell, e.g. ALICE solar cell. At the end of this research, ALICE cells with &#951;~3.83%, Voc~485 mV, Jsc~17.75 mA/cm2 have been achieved.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thin film</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline</field><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44888</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terms and processes in translation between Indonesian and English</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Richard K., School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to examine particular problems that the Indonesian language poses for translators, whether translating from Indonesian to English or English to Indonesian. The notation Indonesian~English translation substitutes the swung dash ~ substitutes for the hyphen -. This notation is used in this thesis to indicate translation either from Indonesian to English or from English to Indonesian. It is a convenient way to make it clear when translation is in both directions. A multifaceted approach to translation will enable translation to be viewed in much the same way as the kinds of demands it places on the translator, who needs constantly to be aware of author~reader, source~target culture, syntax, semantics, semiotics, even geography and even politics. The use of metaphor and illustrations to describe the theoretical processes of translation is justified in the same way that imagery is justified in literature. To go a step further, it is important to see through the artificial distinction often made between interpretation and translation, so that translation acquires flexibility and a deeper ethical structure. A symbolic approach may be used by the translator., involving the perception of modules within text, identified with symbols, that can facilitate the process of translation. With Indonesian, the influx of foreign words occurred in three identifiable stages, Sanskrit, Arabic and Dutch/English. In relation to Indonesian~ English translation, the levels of Javanese and the co-existing presence of the Jakarta dialect may be compared to English vocabulary levels, for example Anglo- Saxon versus Latinate forms. This means an awareness of the existence of layers on the part of the translator. It does not imply a match between the layers in each language, philological layers between English and Indonesian, or strict equivalence between one set of borrowings in English and one in Indonesian. The hypothesis put forward is that there are advantages for the translator in being aware of waves of foreign and regional input that are part of the history of Indonesian as well as English, and that there is potential for creative utilisation of the resources of the two languages. Although a match between the layers in each language or strict equivalence between one set of  borrowings in English and one in Indonesianis not implied, it is useful to recognise word origins where this may impact on the appropriate translation. Examination of the corpus presented in this thesis has shown that the history of Indonesian words can readily affect their meaning, while the history of English words may affect the choice of terms/. Nevertheless it has proved difficult to demonstrate any particular effect of the history or layer of meaning on the choice of terminology in translation. It seems that once the Indonesian term has been understood, the translation that will emerge will not particularly be bound by reference to the history of English terminology. The hypothesis then may be reduced to an observation that the derivation of Indonesian terms, like that of English terms, is important in fully understanding the scope of meaning of the terms. The other hypothesis in this thesis is that texts or terms can be viewed as a root system containing various nodes content that the translator can respond to and wrap into the translated version, with the form of the target text possibly differing from that of the source text. The process of translation can be compared to a process of unpackaging various semantic and other elements in a unit to be translated and repackaging them for the target version. The undbundling~rebundling hypothesis is in the end a very practical matter. It aims to enlarge the discretion of the translator to carry over content with judicious changes in form. It is fair to summarise examination of the corpus by concluding that evidence of the need for unbundling~rebundling has not been convincingly presented in this thesis. It is also fair to say that in general the English translation has followed the order of the Indonesian original quite closely, and this means that a process of unbundling~rebundling is often unlikely to be necessary. Nevertheless the validity of the unbundling~rebundling approach remains, and if a text requires this kind of analysis there is ample justification for its use.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesian language - Translating into English</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23080</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time, quasi-temporal change and imaginary numbers</field><field name="creator">Wiszniewski, Witold Roman, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is mainly concerned with the argument for dynamic time. Accepting McTaggart???s proof of the unreality of time, it is argued however, that any description of dynamic time involving static concepts must lead to a contradiction. It is shown that the contradiction arising from this proof is equivalent to the contradiction posed by Aristotle???s definition of change: change is the possession of incompatible properties. A special case of such a change is quasi-temporal change, defined as the possession of incomparable properties at the same time. Furthermore it is claimed that change is a primitive entity. The Block Universe view that three-dimensional dynamic and four-dimensional static representations of the world are equivalent to each other is rejected because of the unknown nature of imaginary numbers describing the time-like dimension of spacetime. It is proposed that the imaginary number i is an mathematical embodiment of change, expressed in the form of quasi-temporal variable: i = [1,-1]. As such i is a scalar variable with two numbers, 1 and ???1, assigned to it. To develop further this idea the Special Theory of Relativity and Hamilton???s theory of the complex numbers are used. It is claimed that the natures of imaginary numbers the time-like dimension are the same. It is shown that this dimension can be given by two opposite displacements of light occurring at the same time. To use Hamilton???s theory a pair of two times is proposed: normal time and dimensional time. The moments of these times are identified with the Hamilton???s primary and secondary moments of time respectively. It is shown that Hamilton???s theory is invariant upon such identification. This allows the extension of the argument forming the theory of the complex numbers. The second theme of the thesis is an argument for multiplicity of times. It is proposed that every being of a natural kind exists in its own time. Individual time is taken as a composition of topologically open time and topologically closed time. Such a composition allows an explanation of the convolution of change and permanence and also formulation of a new interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23401</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participatory development: methods, skills and processes; a design framed action research thesis</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Martin</field><field name="description">The research question that forms the body of this thesis is: &#8216;What methods, skills and processes does the participatory development practitioner require for effective practice?&#8217;The intention behind this research topic has been to identify how to create socially relevant spaces within todays contemporary conditions of society. This is a reflection of an understanding of myself as someone within the &#8216;idealist&#8217; stream of endeavour as defined by Charles Jencks in &#8216;Modern Movements in Architecture.&#8217;As I have a design background, I chose a design methodology to undertake the study. The methodology is documented by Donald Sch&#246;n in the book &#8216;The Reflective Practitioner&#8217; and is, in a general sense, also the methodology David Kolb documented in &#8216;Experiential Learning: Experience as the Source of Learning and Development&#8217;. An element of this learning approach is for a designer to create a useful artefact that can be considered and evaluated, thus the thesis also comprises the DVD: &#8216;Outside the Gates, Development Processes for the Real World&#8217;.In writing the thesis I became aware that this learning process has been, and still is, central to development itself within our culture of generative change. I first arrived at this intuitively while building the DVD, but it became more explicit during the DVD evaluation. The thesis thus commences with a description and rationale for the methodology.After describing the methodology I devote three chapters to providing the background to both the form and content of the DVD. This draws almost exclusively from personal experience, though with references to architectural history, theory and practice. This includes observations on the theme of technological development, generative change and one of the real needs for our physical and psychological well being - shelter. Thus the DVD sits at a mid point in the thesis. Following the creation of the DVD, I have in accordance with the methodology evaluated its content. To do this I used a literature review generally based on Grounded Theory practice. There are four sections in the DVD, with a chapter dedicated to each of these sections.The thesis concludes with a chapter that fits in the final part of Kolb&#8217;s learning cycle, abstract conceptualisation, that considers the meaning of the findings. Ultimately there is an epilogue that outlines the next &#8216;concrete output&#8217;, a recently completed project based on the learnings from the thesis.

This species is favoured by both small-scale growers for use in mixed species woodlots targeting low-volume high-value sawn timber, and also by industrial forest companies growing monocultures for integrated pulp &#8211; sawn timber regimes. This study investigated whether mixed-species designs can increase the growth of this tropical eucalypt when compared to monocultures.A replacement series experiment with monocultures of Eucalyptus pellita (E) and Acacia peregrina (A) and mixtures in various proportions (75E:25A, 50E:50A, 25E:75A) was used to examine questions about growth and productivity. The trial was located on the Atherton Tablelands of north Queensland, Australia. High mortality in the establishment phase due to repeated damage by tropical cyclones altered the trial design. Effects of experimental designs on tree growth were estimated using a linear mixed effects model with restricted maximum likelihood analysis (REML). Volume growth of individual eucalypt trees were positively affected by the presence of acacia trees at age five years and this effect generally increased with time up to age 10 years. However, the stand volume and basal area increased with increasing proportions of E. pellita, due to its larger individual tree size. Conventional analysis did not offer convincing support for mixed-species designs. Preliminary individual-based modelling using a modified Hegyi competition index offered a solution and an equation that indicates acacias have positive ecological interactions (facilitation or competitive reduction), and definitely do not cause competition like E. pellita. These results suggest that significantly increased growth rates could be achieved with mixed-species designs over E. pellita monocultures. This statistical methodology could enable a better 4 understanding of species interactions in similarly altered experiments, or undesigned mixed-species plantations.The effects of trees on soils are highly variable and highly site and species specific. That trees can change soil chemistry over time is well established. The soil chemical properties under the eucalypt: acacia experiment were compared to several potential baseline data sources: the reference description of this soil type; those measured at 7 months after planting; and with those of soils under two adjacent vegetation types (forest and pasture) when the experiment was aged 9 years. At 9 years after planting soil total nitrogen increased with increasing proportion of acacias in the treatment. The mean total N under the acacia monoculture was significantly higher (P = 0.041) than that of either the eucalypt monoculture, or the surrounding pasture. The proportion of acacia in the treatment was positively linearly correlated with soil total N (r2 = 0.46; P = 0.018). Soils under the eucalypt monocultures were more similar to those under pasture for a range of soil chemical properties, compared with soils under treatments containing acacias. Results from this site show that the two species alter the soil chemistry in different ways. It is possible that the increased total N under the acacias could be facilitating the growth of the E. pellita, however without n-fixation analysis or tissue sampling it is not possible to confirm that the eucalypt is using the N. Similar cause and effect (or &#8216;supply and use&#8217;) questions also remain for soil pH and available phosphorus changes with increasing acacia in treatment. This study also demonstrates the difficulty in monitoring changes in soil properties over long cycles of forest plantations.The photosynthetic response to light was assessed in the stratified canopy of the mixed species field trial of the eucalypt: acacia experiment, and among commonly planted taxa of E. pellita in glasshouse pot trials. In the field trial photosynthetic capacity of fully5 expanded sun and shade leaves of both species was measured. E. pellita has a wide natural distribution with considerable variation in morphology and growth within the species, with several provenances commonly planted in north Queensland. Photosynthetic capacity and leaf nutrient content of three of these taxa (two from northern occurrences and one from southern occurrences of E. pellita) were measured on two occasions in glasshouse pot trials. A non rectangular hyperbolic function was used to describe the light response curves, and analysis of variance was used to determine differences in the biologically relevant curve parameters between treatments. In the field trial sun and shade leaves of E. pellita produced similar light saturated photosynthetic rates, and experienced little competition for light from the acacia crowns. In contrast there was significant variation in the photosynthetic response between acacia sun and shade leaves. In the glasshouse trials, differences in leaf and petiole morphology were observed, which were coupled with differences in leaf nutrient content and highly significant variation in light saturated photosynthetic rate between the three taxa. This study characterised the light response of E. pellita and suggests that differences in physiological responses to resource availability should be expected among taxa within this species, which may be important for forest productivity models which endeavour to predict tree growth and resource use.An empirical model of growth of E. pellita from a designed monocultures vs. mixedspecies experiment has been used to explore system behaviour rather than predict production of this species from specific forests. This approach has allowed examination of the effect of plantation design on competition, soil nutrient pool change with time and physiological responses to light; leading to a greater understanding of why mixtures can lead to greater productivity than monocultures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eucalyptus pellita</field><field name="subject">monoculture plantations</field><field name="subject">timber</field><field name="subject">Forest Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/75</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The philanthropic contract: building social  capital through corporate social investment</field><field name="creator">Cooke, David</field><field name="description">This study investigates the relationship between profit-making corporations and the not-for-profit sector within Australia. The broad field of corporate social responsibility, or CSR, is discussed, narrowing to the activity of corporate philanthropy and corporate social investment. The latter is defined as being philanthropy with strategic intent, in order to build capacity within the recipient organisation which in most cases will produce beneficial outcomes for the donor as well (Tracey, 2003). The title of this study has used the term &#8216;philanthropic contract&#8217; (Broadbent, 2001; Kouzmin, 2007) to describe the relationship between commercial organisations and charitable ones and the unwritten societal expectation, that the corporate sector will support the work of members of the not-for-profit sector. This study also uses the term &#8216;social capital&#8217; (Putnam, 1995) to describe one of the principle areas of benefit for companies who participate.The aspect of the relationship between the two sectors that formed the focus of this study is defined as being the interaction between the two that involves financial contributions and those of goods and services as well as expertise, information and influence flowing from profit-making companies to not-for-profit organisations.The direction of the research is to advance toward an understanding of why corporations engage in this practice and toward a conclusion as to whether corporate social investing is a mutually beneficial exchange. Finally, the study highlights examples of engagement processes, and advice from those participating. The inclusion of these in the study is designed to provide valuable learning for other corporations, and not-for-profit organisations, contemplating entering into their own philanthropic partnerships.Through ten qualitative interviews this inquiry investigated the attitudes toward this relationship of various stakeholders including the management of not-for-profit organisations, representatives of relevant associations and social commentators. It became apparent that the previously well-publicised opposition to publicly listed companies supporting the not-for-profit sector, proffered by organisations such as the Australian Shareholders&#8217; Association, had largely evaporated.Case studies involving five profit-making corporations, operating within Australia, were then undertaken and the views of their senior management sought as regards their motivations, aims, and outcomes. Overwhelmingly their experiences were positive for the corporation, the organisations they were funding, and the members of the community that the recipients were in turn supporting.Corporate benefits reported included increased ability to attract quality staff, enhanced ability to retain staff, significant development for staff that actively participated, improved corporate culture and the building of social capital leading to enhanced reputation which supported the corporations licence to operate, future objectives and long term sustainability.It is hoped that these insights along with the advice offered up by those individuals and organisations that participated in the study will benefit others and promote greater participation in corporate philanthropy and social investment within Australia. vii</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corporate social responsibility</field><field name="subject">corporate social investment</field><field name="subject">corporate philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/72</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planting the seeds of change and growing the fruits of transdisciplinary educational design</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Meg</field><field name="description">The professional practice of educational design normally involves collaborating with a subject matter expert on a one-to-one basis and is only occasionally undertaken in teams. This thesis argues that a team-based approach to educational design is powerful and particularly so when transdisciplinary collaborations are facilitated. Transdisciplinary educational design is the process of standing outside one&#8217;s discipline to collaborate with colleagues from the technical sphere, the library and other disciplines. The common ground shared by the transdisciplinary teams in this research was student assessment.The core data collection for this research was completed between July 2002 and June 2005. Using an overarching action research methodology, three cycles of data collection were completed by action learning sets. Suitable members of the sets were identified through a series of online staff development workshops that were designed and facilitated by the researcher. Two supplementary data collection activities were also undertaken. The first of these was a Web survey that broadly mapped design practices for online assessment in four Australian regional universities. Three rounds of telephone interviews then followed up on survey responses. The second supplementary data collection was undertaken between the second and third action learning cycles to contextualise the online assessment design activities at Southern Cross University within the broader framework provided by the other three regional universities in the original sample. It included focus groups with educational designers and face-to-face interviews with three academics at each of these universities. The entire series of data collection activities was reflectively managed to heighten its effectiveness. This management included screening of suitable participants, negotiation of manageable session times and duration, and establishment of ground rules for attendance and interactions, as well as drawing out a commitment to observe silences as creative spaces in the design process.In keeping with the action research paradigm, an extensive examination of the literature not only provides a background for the research questions but also continues to be threaded throughout the thesis as data collection cycles directed further literature review. The thesis narrative is given an original form through the use of a gardening metaphor that serves to highlight the rewarding, delicate and transitional nature of this kind of educational design. Such transitional aspects of educational design allow for innovation and creativity not evident in the systems-based approaches to designing instruction. This research also supports current initiatives in Australian higher education concerning the first year experience, embedding graduate attributes in the curriculum, and blending on-campus and off-campus learners into one class. The transdisciplinary approach to educational design explored through this research responds effectively to the varied issues in designing online assessment and developing innovative approaches by academic staff</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">educational design</field><field name="subject">academic staff development</field><field name="subject">online assessment</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">action learning</field><field name="subject">case studies</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/71</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards improvement in aviation safety in Thai Airways International Public Company Limited: a model</field><field name="creator">Suthichoti, Supachoke</field><field name="description">Thai Airways International Public Company Limited (THAI) is a very large organization compared to Thai standards. It generates huge incomes to a number of families, directly and indirectly. Like many airlines, the main concern with THAI and the regulatory authorities is safety because THAI is in a mass transportation business. THAI have had two accidents within a span of some six years, killing a total of 214 people. The accidents affected THAI in four key areas, namely political, economical, social and technological. This phenomenon prompted the study of aviation safety in THAI. The question that requires an answer is: &#8220;How should THAI build its protocols to enhance aviation safety?&#8221; This then became the research question. The objective of the study is to build a model suitable for THAI to enhance aviation safety, thus answering the question. Through a review of the literature within the parent disciplines, the product, process, and customers of flying activities were identified. The four processes, the MP, the HRD, the PM and the RS are recognized through rigorous search of the literature. The developments of the required seven elements of skills needed for pilot performance measurement were made.A review of study within the immediate discipline concerning Aviation Safety in THAI was carried out and the current status in THAI was defined. All of these led to the identification of research question, research objective, and research propositions. The research propositions were:&#8226; Research Proposition 1: that the management practice (MP) process receives inputs from the reporting system (RS) process. Outputs from the management practice (MP) process form inputs for the human resource development (HRD) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 2: that the human resource development (HRD) process receives inputs from the management practice (MP) process. Outputs from the human resource development (HRD) process form inputs for the performance measurement (PM) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 3: that the performance measurement (PM) process receives inputs from the human resource development (HRD) process. Outputs from the human resource development (HRD) process form inputs for the reporting system (RS) process.&#8226; Research Proposition 4: that the reporting system (RS) process receives inputs from the performance measurement (PM) process. Outputs from the reporting system (RS) process form inputs for the management practice (MP) process. &#8226; Research Proposition 5: that the individual process components identified in Research Propositions 1, 2, 3 and 4, can be consolidated into an overall, comprehensive Continual Improvement (CI) loop.Once the research propositions were established, the research design was conceived. Due to the fact that THAI is a unique airline influenced by its history of inception and by particular sets of cultures, an embedded, single case-study research method was used. Many techniques within the case-study method were employed starting from a secondary data search, direct observations, focus group interviews, elite interviews, pilot study, participant observations and in-depth interviews. Issues such as validity, reliability, sensitivity, generalizability and ethics were referred to. Issues on data processing, coding, editing, and interpreting were made and discussed.As a result of the various methods of study and the fieldwork previously mentioned, findings were derived. These were then edited, categorized, coded, tabulated and interpreted into meaningful information. Findings from the study and fieldwork supported all the propositions derived from secondary data search and literature review. Consequently the gap identified in the literature was now filled and the principal model was drawn. A slight modification was introduced in keeping with the interpretation of the findings. A recommendation was made that THAI implement policy measures and professional practices derived from the implication of the study to minimize risks in flight operations system and thus maximize safety.Based on the findings of this research, it is recommended that future studies be conducted employing a deductive, quantitative, statistical method to evaluate the model and test its theoretical implications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thai Airways</field><field name="subject">aviation safety</field><field name="subject">pilot performance management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/41</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study into factors influencing the use of value-based management tools</field><field name="creator">Sakunasingha, Benjalux</field><field name="description">For management to perform its functions of planning, organizing, leading and controlling effectively, a control process has to be in place. This control process  should incorporate a target or standard measures and compares performance with the standard, evaluates results and takes any necessary corrective action. Hence, the introduction of the control process, including the measurement and evaluation of performance, has been recognized as a significant progression to ensure organizations achieve their objectives and goals.There are a number of performance measurement tools for management to select but one that stands out as possibly the preferred method is Value-based management (VBM). Value-based management, a relatively new concept, offers management a better way to measure performance in today&#8217;s business environment. The application of VBM links business strategy, finance, performance measurement and management processes all together to create value. VBM tells how the value of an organization is maximized, while developing corporate value is the best long-term measure to show how good the present management is doing its job. Therefore, VBM indicates the current situation as well as future prospects of an organization. Further, VBM helps managers and employees to obtain a sharper focus of the corporate vision and objectives based on one leading measurement indicator &#8211; that is to enhance corporate value. Unlike many performance measurement tools that may focus on many objectives, which may cause the lack of single focus for accountability for shareholder value, VBM provides a clearer objective focusing on the financial objectives across the organization. More importantly, VBM includes the cost of all capital required, while many performance measurement tools still provide incomplete information about cost.The purpose of this research is to study what organization factors influence the choice of performance measurement tools, such as VBM selected by management. This research also studies the manner in which the selection and the use of VBM might affect the performance of organizations in Thailand. A number of studies were made in the past dealing with the effectiveness of VBM.These studies analyzed how VBM assisted management in their administration and measurement of organizational activities. These researches add significantly to the body of knowledge and advance the concept of VBM. However, most researchers ignored an important aspect and that is, what factors influence the management to select and utilize VBM tools in their organization. This research attempts to address this knowledge gap, and answer the following questions: &#8226; What are the organization factors that could influence the selection and the use of VBM tools to measure organization performance? Then importantly,&#8226; Do the selection and the use of VBM tools improve organization performance?To examine and to properly evaluate the above questions, this research study identifies four key objectives. First, factors that influence management in selecting value based management tools to measure performance and set standards are to be identified. Second, identify the relationship between organization performance, the use of VBM and certain organization factors such as organization size, market share position and product life cycle stages. Third, study the impact of VBM on organization performance in the Thai environment. Fourth, provide information on how VBM is selected and used in the electrical and electronic industry in Thailand.The following three hypotheses were proposed to study the behaviour of variables:Hypothesis 1: Organization factors are not the determining factors for selecting and using VBM tools for performance measurement.Hypothesis 2: VBM tool selected and used by an organization do not influence its organization performance.Hypothesis 3: The relationship between organization factors and organization performance are not mediated by the VBM tools selected and used by an organization to measure organization performance.To test the hypotheses empirically, a mailed-survey questionnaire was used to collect data. A stratified sampling technique on a population of 462 Head of Finance/Accounting Departments of the Electrical and Electronics Industry of Thailand was employed. The above hypotheses were tested using several analytical techniques including regression model, correlation coefficient and factor analysis.The result of this research indicates that none of the chosen organization factors studied directly influences the selection and the use of VBM tools. In addition, the findings indicated a significant relationship between independent variables, which are organization size and market share position. But these two factors do not establish significantly relationship with the VBM or an organization performance. Further, although the product life cycle stage was not a factor that influenced the selection and the use of VBM tools, it showed a significant negative relationship with organization performance. This was regardless of whether or not the organization selected and used VBM tools. This indicates that the selection and the use of VBM tools are less preferable when the product of an organization is at the early stages such as emerging and growth stages. On the other hand, VBM tools are more preferred by an organization when its product reaches maturity. Finally, these research findings demonstrate that the selection and the use of VBM tools are significantly related to an improvement in organization performance. In other words, the performance of an organization improved with the use of the VBM tool.It is believed that this research is a first attempt to delineate factors that influence management to select and utilize VBM tools in their organizations. One nation, Thailand and one Industry, the electrical and electronic industry were used as the laboratory to test the hypotheses. It is hoped that future research will replicate this study in other industries and countries that would help to confirm the results of this study. Such studies will not only substantiate this research but also offer new insights into understanding the factors influencing the selection and the use of VBM tools. Different organizational factors, different performance measurement tools, and/or different methodologies in conducting the research showed further contribute to knowledge in this area. The research opportunities are considerable, especially in relation to cross-country comparisons based on performance measurements, using VBM tools and it is this type of research that will improve our understanding of the subject and lead to adoption of these measures in organizations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">financial performance</field><field name="subject">performance measurement</field><field name="subject">organization performance</field><field name="subject">value creation</field><field name="subject">value based management</field><field name="subject">VBM</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/39</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shifting (com)positions on the subject of management: a critical feminist postmodern ethnography of critical care nursing</field><field name="creator">Ogle, Kaye Robyn</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study investigated nurses&#8217; experiences of managing nurses and being managed by nurses within the context of a critical care unit. The four specific aims of the study were to: valorise and make space from which nurses could speak of their management perceptions and experiences; investigate and interrogate the cultural practices and knowledges that comprised and reinscribed the discourses of nursing management; identify the marginal, contradictory or subjugated discourses in the form of alternate or oppositional knowledges and practices embedded in nurses&#8217; experience; and reveal how participants were inscribed by or resisted the various discourses, including the multiple and mobile subject positions they adopted. The ethnography was theoretically informed by critical, feminist, and postmodern perspectives. Utilising the strategy of writing from the authorial position of occupying a mobile or nonunitary subjectivity, the research highlighted the methodological tensions so as to struggle for social justice whilst contesting the romance of knowledge as cure (Lather, 2000). Music was metaphorically appropriated to interrupt, subvert, and draw attention to the partial, interpretive, and intertextual nature of ethnographic representation and to represent the feminine other in a thesis normatively privileging written text. Conducted over a period of ten months, direct participant observation, individual interviews, and reflective field notes comprised the data. Eleven registered nurses, from all levels of the nursing hierarchy, participated in the study, in addition to the researcher. The findings of this research revealed nurses experienced feeling abnormal, lonely, angry, and rejected. Interprofessional relations reflected a lack of individual valuing and predominantly vertical violence. Shifting subject positions were primarily informed by dominant instrumental, patriarchal, managerialist, and modernistic discourses that homogenised the identity of nurses and defined the meaning of progress and normal. Management activities were deemed superior to the activities and being of a clinical nurse. Alternate and subjugated discourses included notions of teamwork, equality, mateship, and viewing management as superfluous and contemptuously. Patriarchal behaviours separating personal life from work life were contested, and behaviours often denigrated and stereotyped as female were valued. Valuing and sharing being human within ordinary nursing work, valuing work for the enjoyment of the work itself, and viewing power as with rather than over were further alternate discourses. The major implications from this study for nursing as a profession relate to nurses explicitly and foremost valuing their own practice and fostering a culture that genuinely permits individual diversity to alter the existing pre-scripted relations that constrain nurses&#8217; ability to engage in more meaningful interpersonal relations. Questioning current discourses and practices that value specific economic and scientific knowledges, support patriarchal behaviours, and silence nurses is essential. The articulation of alternative discourses that value women and nursing is crucial for reconstructing a reality that does not result in women and nurses feeling abnormal, rejected, and alienated; particularly within the context of a nursing shortage.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensive care</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">Health and Medical Administration</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/34</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grow or go: a theory-building study regarding the survival and growth of micro-small enterprises:  action-oriented research conducted at Werbedruck Petzold, Gernsheim, Germany</field><field name="creator">Nogare, Lydia Dalle</field><field name="description">In general terms, this research project evolved in response to my desire to find out more about the planning issues faced by micro to small-sized enterprises (MSEs). In particular, how they plan for survival and growth.As such, the main objective of the action oriented research project is to assess the viability of developing a framework which will be capable of providing structured, useful and relevant  guidance to micro to small-sized enterprises (MSEs) in terms of business survival and growth. In a practical sense, it is important that the framework is also flexible enough to deal with the complexity and fluidity of the real life business environment within which MSEs operate.A review of current growth theory and the current available data and tools aimed at assisting MSE in the area of growth planning is presented in chapter two. This review serves to highlight two important issues which, in turn, guide the research project.- Firstly, an attempted review of current statistical information regarding MSEs highlighted a serious lack of general planning data for this sector within Europe. (Statistics are only analysed and reported for companies with over 20 employees)- Secondly, extant literature regarding growth theories for MSEs, fails to provide one perfect solution. There is a general consensus that it is neither possible, nor desirable, to try to develop one single and fixed model to predict company growth.Chapter two also provides a review of associated disciplines which are closely related to MSE planning ie entrepreneurship, innovation, and complexity. This extended review shows that flexibility and adaptiveness have a great impact on business decisions regarding company survival and growth and further strengthen the case for a flexible solution. Through consideration of these related topics the following three concepts are brought to the fore and are subsequently integrated into the final response to the research questions: - inherent company leadership,- the influence of the external environment and the opportunities and threats it presents to a MSE, - the internal factors which impact MSE company operations and decisionsAs such, Chapter two highlights the need for a bespoke solution which is both reactive and conditional. In order to focus the project, several delimitations were introduced.- Geographically, the research was based upon the prevailing conditions for German and central European MSEs.- Furthermore, a single case study company was selected as it suited the participative requirements of the project. The company is a micro-sized offset printing house.- As the project advanced, it became clear that decisions regarding company survival and growth for MSEs varied greatly depending upon the stage of operations in which the company found itself. Thus, a more specific focus on mature MSEs was adopted as the project and research progressed. By placing these three restrictions on the research project it was possible to conduct meaningful action-oriented research, aimed at generating future action and change  beyond the study, as well as identify and address a very specific set of research problems, namely:Main problem:How can managers of mature micro to small-sized offset printing plants in German/central Europe plan for survival and grow into the future?Sub problems:a. Can a management decision tool be developed to assist this decision and growth process in the mature company?b. How would such a tool be formulated to ensure both effectiveness and acceptance? (what factors should it consider)The key concepts introduced via the extant literature were then integrated into a soft systems review, supported by action-oriented research, in an effort to develop a flexible framework aimed at addressing the research problems.Several phases of research serve to support and build upon, or refine, one another to establish a more relevant and meaningful solution. A preliminary research phase comprising a Delphi study and convergent interviews was supported by group feedback sessions conducted with a small work group from the case study company &#8211; Werbedruck Petzold. The work group reviewed aspects of the developing framework at various stages throughout the project; each time participants were able to refine concepts and enhance the response to the main research problem. Chapters three, four and five present this conceptual development and testing/evaluation process. They also highlight the robustness of the data stemming from repetitive cycles and triangulation techniques integrated into the research design. The ultimate contribution to knowledge which evolved from the action-oriented research is presented in the form of a three-step framework which acknowledges - the overriding and inherent wishes of the MSE&#8217;s owner/manager - the opportunities and threats posed by the external environment, and- the mix of functions each MSE must develop to meet its own specific goals, given its own environmental situation. It is important to note that the response to the research problem is not a fixed model which can be systematically applied to all MSEs. But is rather a flexible framework which is intended to be actioned by MSEs, given their own situations and goals. The key to the proposed framework is that it must be continually reviewed to reflect the &#8216;current reality&#8217; of a MSE. It is basically a framework which has been developed via action oriented research techniques and is intended for ongoing case-specific, action, review, and refinement. It represents a shift in growth theory for MSEs as it embraces and promotes contingency, thus better reflecting the reality of MSEs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-small enterprises &#8211; Germany</field><field name="subject">small business &#8211; Germany</field><field name="subject">action-oriented research</field><field name="subject">small business - research</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/33</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total quality management as the basis for organizational transformation of Indian Railways: a study in action research</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Madhu Ranjan</field><field name="description">The basic objective of this research was to assess the suitability of Total Quality Management (TQM) via the International Standards Organization (ISO) 9000/2000 quality accreditation system route for bringing about organisational transformation in the Indian Railways and to develop an India specific model for taking an ISO certified organization towards TQM.The first part of the research aimed at getting the &#8216;as is&#8217; and &#8216;should be&#8217; status of Indian Railways from an organisational change point of view. Based on the work carried out by Khandwalla (1995), a series of open-ended and close-ended questions were asked to the senior members of Indian Railways. Analysis of their responses was undertaken. It indicated that the way they thought Indian Railways should change was in line with the TQM model of change.The culture-TQM fit was studied as a part of this research. &#8216;Hierarchy&#8217; (or power distance) and its related concept &#8216;collectivism&#8217; were identified as the two cultural constructs which affect the successful implementation of TQM. The second part of the research aimed at measuring the hierarchical orientation among the employees of Indian Railways. This was measured on three dimensions of &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;, &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; and &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; based on the work done by Sinha (1995). It was found that among the three dimensions, &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217; were more deeply  entrenched cultural traits among Indian Railway employees as compared to &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217;. On the two dimensions of &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;, the class 1 officers of Indian Railways were less hierarchy conscious than the class 2 officers who, in turn, were less hierarchy conscious than the supervisors. The tendency for &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; did not vary significantly either across the class 1 officer, class 2 officer and supervisor categories or across different age groups. Further, employees less than 30 years old, from 31 years to 50 years old and more than 50 years old, demonstrated similar level of &#8216;status consciousness&#8217; and &#8216;dependency proneness&#8217;. This shows that at least in the Indian Railways, even among the younger generation, notwithstanding 15 years of liberalisation, hierarchical orientation continues to be a powerful cultural trait.The third part of the research aimed at understanding the impact of ISO 9000 implementation in the Indian Railway units. It was found that, contrary to the literature, there was no resistance to implementation of  ISO based change in the Indian Railways. This research argues that because of their strong sense of identity with their work group, the employees of Indian Railways are more amenable to an internal leader initiated change. Hence there was no resistance to change.The fourth part of the research was an action research project aimed at ISO 9000:2000 certification of a warehousing unit in the Indian Railways. This was carried out to investigate the way organisational learning occurred during ISO certification. Three action cycles were conducted over a period of two months. Seven months later, one additional cycle was completed. Special care was taken to see that the conclusions arrived after one cycle were validated from other sources. It was found that departmentalism and lack of team spirit are major problems in Indian Railways. Both are ascribed to the caste system in India. It is hypothesised that since an Indian Railway employee remains in a department throughout his/her career, the department becomes his/her &#8216;professional caste&#8217;. The research then identifies an Indianised version of leadership in the context of organisational change. It hypothesises that hierarchical teacher-student (guru-shishya) relationship with the leader invokes personal bases of power which promotes change in India. The teacher-student (gurushishya) relationship with the leader is conceptually similar to &#8216;intellectual stimulation&#8217; factor of transformational leadership. The &#8216;personalised relationship&#8217; with a more equitable slant can be elevated to the status of &#8216;individualised consideration&#8217; factor of transformational leadership and the Nurturant Task (NT) leadership model of India is conceptually similar to the contingent reward factor of transformational leadership.In the context of TQM, this research hypothesises that there is a sequential relationship among the critical success factors (CSFs) of TQM. For this, one should begin by framing process-based quality procedures and quality objectives. Process based quality procedures and quality objectives lead to development of team orientation in the context of TQM implementation. Similarly, a multi-tier Corrective and Preventive  Action (CPA) reinforced with a reward and recognition system, positively intervenes in the transition of an ISO certified organization towards TQM.The learning arrived at in different parts of the research was finally integrated into a model for transforming an ISO certified unit towards TQM. The model shows that propagation of customer satisfaction as a value and not just as a measurement- as in a customer satisfaction index &#8211; is key for replacing some of the dysfunctional traditional Indian values which do not fit in a liberalised economy. More specifically, the compulsion of implementing a &#8216;Corrective / Preventive Action&#8217; makes a person come out of his/her traditional moorings and thus begins his/her socialisation outside his/her &#8216;professional  caste&#8217;. The reinforcing effect of successive improvement inculcates a feeling of team spirit among members of different functional groups. Successive CPAs supported by a suitable reward system and an Indianised version of leadership mentioned earlier create a spiral vortex which continually pulls the organization towards achieving TQM.Finally, this research establishes a link between the soft system methodology and an India specific cultural dimension called &#8216;context sensitivity&#8217;. The researcher argues that it is because of context sensitivity of Indians that no resistance to change was found during ISO implementation in Indian Railways. This also explains why post liberalisation Indians have been able to make a mark in the world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">TQM</field><field name="subject">Indian culture</field><field name="subject">ISO9000</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">Indian railways</field><field name="subject">bureaucracy</field><field name="subject">organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Nurturant Task leadership</field><field name="subject">organisational transformation</field><field name="subject">systems theory</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="subject">Organizational Behavior and Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/28</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge asset management: the strategic management and knowledge management nexus</field><field name="creator">James, Paul</field><field name="description">This research sought to establish the nexus between the two management disciplines of strategic management and knowledge management. Through a study of the life cycle of knowledge assets within the Australian Public Sector, this nexus has been established. Over the last three decades, there has been a growing interest in the nascent discipline of knowledge management (Wiig 1997). However, discussion regarding knowledge, knowledge workers and knowledge management started much earlier when Chester Barnard&#8217;s management classic The Functions of the Executive (1938) included suggestions made on how to manage knowledge workers. The 1960s saw management authors and researchers such as Peter Drucker (1993; 1994; 1995; 1997a; 1997b), Machlup (1962), and Michael Polanyi (1967) discussing topics such as knowledge work, knowledge workers, and tacit and explicit knowledge. During much the same period, strategic management was also being researched and discussed, with Alfred D. Chandler being among the first scholars to study strategic management. His book Strategy and Structure (1962) described the development of organisations, and showed that the practice of strategic management predated its study as a management discipline. Chandler was followed by other researchers including Igor Ansoff (1965) and Learned, Christensen, Andrews and Guth (1965), Henry Mintzberg (1979; 1985; 1990; 1996a; 1996b; 1999), and Michael E. Porter (1980; 1985). Research continues in both disciplines; however, research on the interface between these two important disciplines is rare, particularly in Australia.The Australian Public Sector was selected as the target industry for this research, and case study as the research strategy. The research strategy combined a variety of methods including interviews, questionnaires and surveys. The approach taken with data analysis was to employ aspects of the approach used in grounded theory. In addition, action research was used as a meta-methodology, in that periods of review and reflection were undertaken that generated improvements to the research methodology. This research has found that there is a marked interdependence between strategic management and the management of knowledge assets. The strategic management process requires skills and capabilities (knowledge assets) for its execution. Moreover, the resultant strategies require the exploitation of knowledge assets to ensure effective implementation. The life cycle of knowledge assets starts and ends when their need or otherwise is identified directly or indirectly by strategic plans. Knowledge assets are acquired, deployed, utilised and maintained until they are no longer needed. They are then disposed of by outsourcing or atrophy when people are redeployed or retrained. This research has focused on the disciplines of strategic management and knowledge management; however, its contribution lies largely in the area of capability management. Corporate strategy theorists, from the RBV (Resource Based View) and KBV (Knowledge Based View) schools, see organisations as a body of knowledge (Spender 1996). From the perspective of knowledge assets, used as the theme of this research, an organisation is a body of capabilities, and to achieve corporate objectives, the capabilities must match the strategies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">knowledge management</field><field name="subject">strategic management</field><field name="subject">knowledge assets</field><field name="subject">resource based view</field><field name="subject">knowledge based view</field><field name="subject">view of the firm</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/25</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Just a small window to get some leverage : A critical examination of the rise of Te Wananga o Aotearoa with particular emphasis on the role of the State in the battle for control of this Maori tertiary educational institution</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Bruce</field><field name="description">The 17 July 1863 saw a British military force led by Major General Cameron, with Crimean War experience, invade the Waikato of Aotearoa New Zealand, and essentially ending for Waikato Maori on 2 April 1864 at Orakau when Cameron with 1,200 troops, defeated a group of 300 Maori that included representatives of at least nine iwi, and women and children, led by Rewi Maniapoto.In December 1863, well before the events of Orakau, the New Zealand Settlements Act of 1863 (NZSA) was passed into law. This Act&#8217;s only purpose was to confiscate 1,408,400 hectares of land from Maori; 486,500 hectares from Waikato Maori, of whom Ngati Maniapoto are an important part. The Act deprived Maori of their traditional lands and the means to participate in the economy, with serious social and economic consequences for them well into the 20th century.In 1993, tertiary educational status was granted to what was essentially an initiative of the people of Ngati Maniapoto that began in 1983 to provide educational alternatives to young people, predominately Maori. This initiative became Te Wananga o Aotearoa (TWOA). Over a period of six years from 1998, TWOA moved from being an insignificant tertiary educational institution to the largest in the country in terms of student and equivalent full time student numbers. By mid 2005, TWOA was under the control of the State, the first time such a situation had occurred in this country, and completely contrary to the independence provisions that the Education Act 1989 bestows on tertiary educational institutions.This thesis is an examination of the State&#8217;s battle for control of TWOA, to consider likely reasons why the State sought this control, and the tactics used by the State to achieve this outcome.The thesis examines the part that knowledge and access to education plays in global economics in the late 20th and early 21st century, and will consider whether knowledge and access to education was as economically important to individuals in these times, as land was in 1863.The fact that TWOA&#8217;s success was achieved completely within the parameters of the tertiary education policies of both successive Governments since 1998 was irrelevant to the NZ Labour Party led Government of 2005. They appeared to set out on a predetermined path to gain control, in order to neutralise TWOA&#8217;s growth and to then reshape the sector to ensure that such success did not happen again. The conclusion is that what was seen as a just a small &#8216;window&#8217; to get some leverage, was thrown open, and very powerful levers then used, to achieve this end.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous education</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand politics</field><field name="subject">abuse of power</field><field name="subject">land</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">NZ National Party</field><field name="subject">NZ Labour Party</field><field name="subject">access to eduction</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/110</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of psycho-social experience in chronic disease</field><field name="creator">Alexander, James McAlister</field><field name="description">This study examines the role of psycho-social factors in contributing to chronic illness, in particular Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and cancer. Research conducted over the last 50 years indicates a modest role for psycho-social factors as risk factors for these conditions. The research suggests that in combination with other modest risk factors, psycho-social factors play an equally important role. Grossarth-Maticek &amp; Eysenck (1990) gained notoriety by reporting research results which seriously question current wisdom. Grossarth-Maticek &amp; Eysenck (1990) conducted what must be considered the largest long term prospective psychological health study. They followed around 20,000 probands for 15 years in order to determine the relative contributions to health outcomes (primarily cancer and CHD) of standard medical and psycho-social risk factors. They reported an 81% accuracy of prediction of death by cancer or CHD with the use of a psychometric test. Further, answers to the test were reported to be six times more predictive of cancer or CHD than were any of the standard medical risk factors, either taken on their own or together. Being far in excess of claims made by any other researchers, the treatment/prevention implications of Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s study are far reaching. It is an important endeavor to examine possible influencing factors in these results. While scientific fraud can never be excluded, in the absence of any incriminating evidence, this assertion is considered to be non-empirical. Amelang (1991) wonders whether unknown, favourable and non replicable conditions were present in Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s samples or methodology which influenced the results. The current research program represents an attempt to ascertain what some of those factors may have been. It is suggested here that Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s probands learnt of their cancer or CHD proneness in the course of the interview which formed the basis of the data collected in their study. Focusing on this aspect of Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s data collection methodology, the possibility of a large scale treatment effect emerges. The most psychologically vulnerable of his probands, having been stimulated by the interview process, may have ruminated and &#8216;catastrophized&#8217; over their health prospects during the ensuing years, thereby making themselves physiologically more vulnerable to the feared conditions. The possibility of probands being adversely influenced by the interview is tested in the current study with subjects being measured for changes in cancer/CHD risk perception and anxiety levels as a result of participation in the &#8216;Grossarth-Maticek interview&#8217; format. In order to test this hypothesis, two studies were undertaken in which Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s data collection method was replicated with 105 subjects. Subjects were assessed on a range of self report items prior to the &#8216;Grossarth-Maticek&#8217; interview, and again post to this interview. They were assessed as to their beliefs about vulnerability to cancer and CHD; and their levels of anxiety in relation to contracting these conditions. Subject&#8217;s responses to learning of their &#8216;health prediction&#8217; according to Grossarth-Maticek&#8217;s assessment tool were also measured via a heart rate monitor. Changes in subject&#8217;s self report measures and heart rate responses were noted and associations to the type of health prediction which they were given at the end of the interview was assessed. In the second study, the relative effects of family history, Neuroticism and time on disease risk perception and anxiety were studied via statistical analyses of self report measures. The results of this study do not support the notion of the interview having any adverse influence. Problems with the methodology and sample selection may have influenced the outcome. It is concluded that for these reasons, the current study did not represent a thorough test of the current hypothesis. Recommendations for a superior test of this hypothesis are made.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/61</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What drug problem? Cannabis and heroin in an alternative community</field><field name="creator">de Launey, Carol Ann</field><field name="description">Does Nimbin have a drug problem? This tiny village in north-eastern NSW has an international reputation for its alternative community and its street drug market. Ever since the Aquarius Festival thirty years ago Nimbin has fascinated the media, and recurrent headlines about the village's (undefined) 'drug problem' suggested my research topic. My research aim was to investigate the meaning/s of Nimbin's 'drug problem' in the context of Nimbin's 'alternative' culture. Because the topic of illicit drugs is both ethically challenging and highly sensitive, my research design was strongly participant-focused, with an emphasis on confidentiality balanced by a mixed methodology to cross-validate results. My methods included an anonymous household (door-to-door) survey based on a national household survey; an anonymous mailed-back survey of Nimbin and Lismore drug injectors; taped interviews with health and legal professionals, cannabis activists and drug dealers; semi-structured interviews with 'professional' cannabis crop growers; and participant observation over several years. I found the multi-method research design to be particularly effective for investigating illegal drug marketing and use, and the design provided me with multiple perspectives on a complex issue. Superficially, there appeared to be two drug 'problems' in Nimbin &#8212; one was the (largely cannabis) street market, and the other revolved around heroin users, and included complaints about scruffy-looking people hanging around the main street, or overdosing in the public toilet. However, my research suggested that these issues, while immediately comprehensible as 'drug problems', obscured more complex issues. For example, the village's street drug market was intertwined with the local economy and with the alternative community's values and drug use, while close to half of the drug injectors lacked secure housing (which creates problems that are not related to heroin), and all heroin users were blamed for the actions of few. Many factors influence the creation and maintenance of what we might call 'problems', and drugs are frequently blamed for broader social problems. What is Nimbin&#8217;s drug problem? The answer depends, in part, on the drug of interest, but more importantly it depends on your definition of a &#8216;problem&#8217;. Some useful and meaningful perspectives on this important social issue include quantified indicators such as death, injury, arrest rates, the economics of black markets, the demographics of drug use, and estimates of &#8216;social costs&#8217;. Qualitative perspectives include people&#8217;s opinions about drugs, media-generated moral panics, the effects of social marginalisation, and the role of drug cultures. A number of &#8216;drug problems&#8217; arise as a direct result of drug illegality. They include black markets, corruption, drug-related violence, theft, stronger forms of the drug, and more dangerous using practices (with the risk drug overdoses and HIV/AIDS), as well as public nuisance issues. Government policy, judicial sentencing and public opinion are moving towards the social reintegration of illicit drug users, but this is almost invariably counter-balanced by a toughening of legal sanctions against supply of the same drug. Most discussions about illicit drugs fail to consider the long-term implications of harsh penalties for, and elaborate and punitive police operations (such as occurred throughout my Nimbin research) against, small-scale independent growers and dealers. The only way to directly engage with drug markets and all the attendant problems, is to legitimise and regulate the supply of recreational drugs. I discuss several examples of the important role of the drug culture in mitigating problems caused by illegality. One example is the influence of Nimbin's alternative community on the style of the drug market. The village drug scene more closely resembles the many north coast village craft markets, than it does Kings Cross, Cabramatta or New York's Bronx. Buyers are north coast locals, along with national and international tourists (the small village is known to cannabis users world-wide, both through media attention and word-of-mouth). Nimbin offers a 'safe' village market ambience and competitive prices to a mainly cannabis using clientele. I suggest that there are two major underlying influences on the experience of a &#8216;drug problem&#8217;, regardless of the drug or the place. They are: 1. Political influences &#8212; specifically the effects of government policy on black markets, law enforcement practices, and access to services and resources; 2. Cultural influences &#8212; particularly the beneficial effects of norms and functional role models for the safe use of a drug, cultural effects on the drug market, and the role/s of the drug in the day-to-day life of the culture. These influences can operate with, or despite, each other, and can create or ameliorate many &#8216;drug problems&#8217;. In the case of Nimbin&#8217;s alternative culture, government policy has created a number of drug problems and the counter-culture has worked to minimise them. In my research into Nimbin&#8217;s &#8216;drug problem&#8217; I have clarified some issues and raised a number of others. I have examined the notion of a &#8216;drug problem&#8217; from several perspectives using a range of research tools, and discussed some key influences on the problem associated with drug use. Drawing from the Nimbin research and my reading, I suggest legalising the recreational drugs to bring them under the dual controls of supply legislation and social norms. In conclusion, I suggest that we need to be very clear about what &#8216;drug problem&#8217; it is that we are talking about, and indeed, whether the problem is really about drugs at all.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drug culture</field><field name="subject">heroin</field><field name="subject">cannabis</field><field name="subject">illicit drug use</field><field name="subject">Social and Behavioral Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/60</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explaining and predicting rural turnover intentions and behaviours in Charleville, Australia</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jennifer Adele</field><field name="description">Attracting and retaining employees has emerged as one of the most important issues currently challenging organizations worldwide, and in the rural setting it has become a genuine concern for public and private sectors.  Longstanding research into turnover has historically been rather piecemeal, for example attrition and retention research has focused on employment conditions such as pay or supervision (Richards et al. 1994; Dinham &amp; Scott 1996; Dodd-McCue and Wright 1996; Rahim 1996; Scott et al. 1998; Cheney et al. 2004; Robinson &amp; Pillemer 2007; Gow et al 2008; Newton 2008) or personal factors such as personality (Deary, Watson &amp; Hogston 2003; Bakker 2006).  This research study adopted a multi-focus or ecological perspective and provided a holistic understanding of employee turnover, something that has been lacking from much of the previous literature. This thesis evaluated turnover intentions and behaviours, through investigating personal, work and community variables with a group of rural public service employees in Charleville, South West Queensland, Australia.  The purpose of this study was to examine the factors that influenced a rural government workers decision to stay in or leave their job, and could these predict turnover.  It has implications for organizations and workforce management in rural settings but some parts may be applied to the urban context.Eighty-nine workers from 12 state government departments were studied in 2003 and 2004.  Eight variables were researched including professional, personal and community factors, job satisfaction, stress, social support, organizational commitment, intent to remain and actual turnover behaviour.  The research methods used were surveys, interviews and observations.  A descriptive picture of the sample was formed using some of the data in the survey.  The rest of the survey data was analysed using regression analysis.  This information was then used as the basis for the interviews.  This data along with the observation data were analysed qualitatively.The two main hypotheses for this study were, 1) personal, professional and community variables influence employee turnover, and 2) that it was possible to predict turnover from these three variables.  Consequently, the primary research questions were &#8216;can we explain employee turnover intentions and behaviours by evaluating personal, professional and community variables?&#8217; and &#8216;Can these factors be used to predict turnover?&#8217;  The results of this study support both hypotheses.  It was found that personal, professional and community factors did influence rural government worker turnover; and that turnover can be predicted.  Furthermore, that intent can be used as a predictor of turnover.  It argues that employee turnover is a complex process involving personal, professional, community, stress, job satisfaction, social support, commitment and intent variables.  This study identifies the factors that influence actual and intended rural government employee turnover and gives organizations a platform for operationalizing effective retention programs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retention</field><field name="subject">attrition</field><field name="subject">turnover</field><field name="subject">staff</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">government employees</field><field name="subject">predicting</field><field name="subject">demographics</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">supervisor</field><field name="subject">promotional opportunities</field><field name="subject">holistic approach</field><field name="subject">personal factors</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">turnover intentions</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/111</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical feminist exploration of the workplace culture, experiences and practice of women mental health nurses within an acute inpatient facility</field><field name="creator">Ward, Louise</field><field name="description">This research investigated the experiences and practices of mental health registered nurses working within an acute mental health facility. The research explored the workplace environment and sought to gain a greater understanding of the elements that contribute to a safe and healthy workplace setting.The research methodology utilised a critical feminist framework. Thirteen women participants were involved in the research project including myself as a research participant. All participants were employed in an acute mental health facility in New South Wales. Four research methods were incorporated into the study these were focus groups, individual interviews, reflective journaling and creative expression and journaling. The study revealed a diverse range of opinion on nursing culture and profession, linking individual experience with group connectiveness, value and belonging.The findings of this research demonstrated that the women&#8217;s experience and practices as registered nurses working in mental health care were influenced directly by the management of the health service organisation and the operational leadership within the mental health facility. The data revealed five themes, these were: stress and mental health nursing practice, coping with violence, professional development, the spirit of nursing and the therapeutic relationship.Overall there were numerous links between the women&#8217;s experiences as nurses and their relationships with their colleagues, patients and the community. The results exposed professional pressures and inherent tensions within mental health nursing and highlighted an urgency to review a current health care structureThe study identified environmental factors that impacted upon the workplace and revealed a dichotomy between the nurses&#8217; perception of care and their ability to provide it. The research raised disquiet regarding violence and aggression, inadequate career structure, recruitment, retention and education. Jutxaposed to this, the research identified collegial friendship, spirituality and stress management as contributing factors to a safe and healthy workplace. Finally, the notions of teamwork, diversity and creativity were found to be intrinsically linked to job satisfaction and client outcome.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/99</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A research model for the scientific investigation of homoeopathy</field><field name="creator">Baker, Don G</field><field name="description">Homoeopathy is a controversial form of medicine that is governed by the premise that highly diluted substances that can a defined set of symptoms in a healthy person can cure a similar set of symptoms in a non-healthy person. The use of highly diluted homoeopathic substances that may no longer be expected to contain any trace of the original substance is contrary to accepted pharmacological theory. In addition to serial dilution, homoeopathic &#8220;potentisation&#8221; of substances also includes violent agitation of the substance at each dilution step, a process known as &#8220;succussion&#8221;. The role of this process is not understood. The fact that the mechanism of action of homoeopathic substances is unknown adds to the controversial nature of this therapy.A review of the literature demonstrated that a more rigorous approach to the research of homoeopathy was needed in order to investigate whether homoeopathy could be investigated within a scientifically appropriate context. It was initially proposed that, through the successful replication of an existing trial, a series of clinical trials based on this replication could be conducted to test fundamental questions of homoeopathy. For pragmatic reasons, this initial approach was abandoned. A novel protocol that was subsequently designed to scientifically evaluate the effects of homoeopathy, in particular, the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, was subsequently developed.A description of homoeopathy, its development, its placement within the scientific paradigm and its role in the treatment of various clinical conditions is reviewed in Chapter 1. From this literature review, hypotheses were generated to test the effect of the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis. Chapter 2 describes the selection process and proposed replication of a prior clinical trial with a successful outcome upon which to base a further series of clinical trials to test fundamental questions in homoeopathy. The selected study was a randomised, double-blind clinical trial designed to compare the effects of a complex homoeopathic preparation with the effects of paracetamol in the treatment of osteoarthritic knee pain. The study was prematurely terminated when another study presented evidence that the analgesic effect of paracetamol was no better than placebo. The uncertainty that paracetamol was no better than placebo raised doubts as to the validity of any outcome had the trial proceeded. The proposal to develop a series of clinical trials replicating the protocol of this study was postponed as a consequence.Chapter 3 describes the subsequent formation of a &#8216;think tank&#8217; consisting of epidemiologists, biostatisticians, clinical researchers in complementary medicine and homoeopaths and the subsequent development of a rigorous research protocol for the investigation of homoeopathy within the scientific paradigm. This homoeopathic research model and is described in detail.Chapter 4 describes a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with five arms designed to evaluate both the research model and the homoeopathic treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.Chapter 5 details the results of this clinical trial. No significant difference was demonstrated between individualised homoeopathic treatment, generic complex homoeopathic treatments or placebo. Furthermore, no positive effect on treatments was demonstrated by the inclusion of a full homoeopathic consultation.Chapter 6 provides a discussion of the clinical trial. Possible reasons for the discrepancy between the hypothesised outcomes and the results of the clinical trial are explored and directions for future research are suggested.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homoeopathy - research</field><field name="subject">homoeopathic substances</field><field name="subject">homoeopathic remedies</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/54</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America and England and Wales</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Jill Irene</field><field name="description">This thesis entitled, A Comparative Study of Paralegalism in Australia, the United States of America and England and Wales, examines the role that paralegals play in the delivery of legal services and the educational opportunities that are available to support that role in Australia as compared to England (and Wales) and the United States of America (US). As in other parts of the common law world it is accepted in Australia that not all work which is of a legal nature is performed by qualified legal practitioners. This is despite a rigid demarcation between qualified lawyers and other legal workers. The structure and regulation of the legal profession have an impact in determining the nature of paralegalism in Australia. The legal profession&#8217;s monopoly in Australia is, however, confined to the right of appearance in a court of law and to the preparation of certain documents for reward, which leaves a vast field of legal tasks open to performance by other workers, including paralegals. The legal profession is facing many challenges in the twenty first century, including the need to deliver better and cheaper legal services. Paralegals, as part of the legal service industry, are affected by the same tensions but are well placed to contribute to a more &#8220;streamlined&#8221; practice and to assist in providing greater access to justice for many disadvantaged Australians.This thesis explores the difficulties for Australian paralegals given that there is little formal recognition of, or status accorded to, the paraprofession. Indeed, the word paralegal is not easily understood nor widely used and this translates into uncertainties as to qualifications, market position and function to provide a definition and to determine the parameters of the profession. Paralegals work in a variety of legal environments which include, but are not limited to, working in private legal practices where they are supervised by lawyers.Further, in order to achieve recognition and to make a meaningful contribution to legal service delivery, paralegals require specialist education. This thesis examines the educational opportunities which are available to paralegals in Australia and makes recommendations as to future accreditation based on appropriate qualifications and experience.In order to gain further insight, comparisons are made between the role that paralegals play in the delivery of legal services in two other common law jurisdictions and Australia. Paralegals play a significant role in the delivery of legal services in the US, where many states constitute bigger jurisdictions than the whole of the Australia. American paralegalism has a twenty year &#8220;head start&#8221; on that of Australia and it is reasonable to anticipate that their challenges will mirror ours in the future. England, on the other hand, has a legal system very close to our own and the examination of paralegals in both England and Wales has revealed both similarities and differences to our Australian experience, both of which inform the research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paralegal</field><field name="subject">paralegals &#8211; Australia</field><field name="subject">paralegals - United States</field><field name="subject">paralegals - England and Wales</field><field name="subject">legal executives</field><field name="subject">legal assistants</field><field name="subject">access to justice</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/53</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Snakes in the grass: visual research into myth themes as a means of understanding and interpreting current environmental issues, and as a vehicle for generating art works in response to those issues : an exegesis of the serpent archetype in Mesopotamian/biblical and aboriginal Australian belief systems</field><field name="creator">Rhys, Gillian Lenin</field><field name="description">Snakes in the grass is a visual research endeavour that utilises an arts and science disciplinary interface, to develop a method for generating a series of contemporary allegorical artworks that engage a study of Serpent symbolism and mythology. On the side of Trinity Catholic College beside St. Carthage&#8217;s Cathedral in Lismore stands a life-sized sculpture of the Virgin Mary standing on a Serpent. Inside the school can be found a smaller version of the same sculpture, where priests and students light candles and incense, and place them around the statue. This thesis researches and questions the iconography of the &#8216;cursed Serpent&#8217; as a primary signifier in the European Biblical tradition in Australia, as it stands alongside the iconography of the existing Indigenous cultures of this land, cultures that have a tradition of Serpent veneration. The intention is to identify correlations between differing cultural and social attitudes that are embedded in religious traditions, and different attitudes to the use of natural resources. Material collected through studying the history of Biblical traditions is superimposed, in a form of cultural montage, on to images of technical procedures of research undertaken by scientists researching an innovative water remediation process on Mt Carrington in northern NSW. The scientific research was focused at a disabled gold mine, where acid mine drainage contamination was severe, and represents a small yet significant example of environmental issues being faced all over the world. This research used salt water neutralised bauxite, or red mud, a waste product from aluminium mining to remediate water and soil affected by gold and silver mining. The creative process developed into a contemporary allegorical narrative that operates as a personification and an enactment of a subjective re-reading of issues surrounding Serpent symbolism and the environment. The resulting artworks include paintings, photographs and an earthwork sculpture on the mine site at Mt Carrington. These works are generated to research, focus attention on, and stimulate discussion about cultural and environmental changes and challenges in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/63</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reactive in-situ covers for the remediation of mine waste rock using BAUXSOL lime and biosolids</field><field name="creator">Maddocks, Gregory Arthur</field><field name="description">Failure to design, construct and remediate waste rock and tailings storage facilities at mine sites leads to adverse environmental degradation and unforeseen financial costs. Typical closure options for these facilities include barrier or store and release covers. This thesis investigates the use of reactive in-situ covers as an alternative engineering design approach that involves mixing reagents (e.g. BauxsolTM) with waste rock to neutralise acidity and to immobilise major and minor metals. It was unknown whether this approach could be achieved at a field scale, whether the use of BauxsolTM would achieve its primary objectives, whether there would be adverse effects on the soil chemistry or whether there would be adverse ecotoxicological problems.Four 400 m2 field trials were conducted at a mine site and included a Control; Bauxsol&#8482; (25 kg / m2) plus biosolids (15 kg / m2); Lime (2.5 kg / m2) plus biosolids (15 kg / m2) and a fourth site that was encapsulated with 0.3 m of compacted clay and 0.1 m of topsoil. The results suggest that soil chemistry can be significantly improved by mixing Bauxsol&#8482; with the top 0.5 m of the waste rock profile i.e., creating a reactive in situ cover. This was sufficient to create a root zone up to 1.6 m deep that had pH greater than 5 and lower concentrations of metals measured using a sequential extraction procedure. Treatment of the acid mine waste with Lime did not achieve marked improvement of soil conditions in soil layers below the amended zone. The capping treatment created a topsoil layer with higher pH, but the underlying mine soil remained unimproved. Leachate pH in the Control became increasingly acidic (pH 4.57 to pH 3.95). The addition of Lime and biosolids led to an initial increase in leachate pH, compared to the Control, however this decreased over the duration of the study (pH 5.37 to pH 4.89). In the Bauxsol&#8482; and biosolids treatment leachate pH increased to 6.92 after the first rainfall event and continued to increase over the duration of the study to pH 7.4. After 24 months metal leachate concentrations (mg / L) in the lysimeters for Al, Cd, Cu, Mn and Zn were (Control: 32.6, 5.7, 12.7, 39.3, 121.8), (Bauxsol&#8482;: 0.07, 0.02, 0.07, 0.57, 0.23) and (Lime: 2.19, 1.19, 2.33, 3.6, 28.4). No leachate was available for collection from the Clay treatment indicating that this technique was functioning in terms of minimising the infiltration of water into the mine soil.Ecotoxicological studies of major and minor metals in eucalypt leaves from the field trials and earthworm bioaccumulation studies were undertaken. The Bauxsol&#8482;, Ca(OH)2 and Clay treatments in the field trials allowed good tree growth of four eucalypt species, compared to the Control. There was no statistical difference in tree growth between the Bauxsol&#8482;, Lime or Clay treatments over the two years of monitoring. However the growth of one tree species was poor in the Bauxsol&#8482; treatment.Laboratory bioaccumulation assessments found that there was good motility and no mortality of the earthworm species E. fetida after 28 days exposure to metal loaded BauxsolTM. The bioaccumulation of metals in E. fetida and bioaccumulation factors were below reported toxicity thresholds to cause mortality and below reported bioaccumulation factors for moderately contaminated soils, indicating that the metals bound to the Bauxsol&#8482; reagents are mostly non-bioavailable E. fetida. Analyses of the 20 % treatment at 28 days using a sequential extraction procedure showed that &gt; 95 % of the metals are bound within the Fe / Mn oxide fractions. However, changes occurred in metal fractionation after exposure to E. fetida for Cd, Cr and Fe, Mn. The data also showed that the exchangeable (1M MgCl2) and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure extractant are useful as indicators of metal bioavailability to E. fetida.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/109</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abundance, behaviour and habitat use patterns of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (&lt;em&gt;Tursiops aduncus&lt;/em&gt;) in the Clarence and Richmond River estuaries in northern New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Fury, Christine Ann</field><field name="description">Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.) are a widely studied species in marine habitats, however, information on estuarine populations in Australia is very limited. To fully understand the importance of estuaries as habitats for dolphins there needs to be clear quantitative data on dolphin populations and their habitat use in estuaries. This study provides the first published data on Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) abundance estimates, site fidelity, individual ranging patterns, habitat use, flood impacts and sexual segregation patterns over a 3- year period in the Clarence River (CR) and Richmond River (RR) estuaries in northern New South Wales, Australia.The results indicate that, at present, the CR estuary is sustaining a larger dolphin community with a predominantly resident population compared to the RR estuary, which supports a smaller community with lower site fidelity. The CR estuary dolphin abundance estimate of 71 (62-81 95% CI, CV = 0.07) is more than twice the size of the RR estuary abundance estimate of 34 (19- 49 95% CI, CV = 0.23). Differences in site fidelity were observed between the estuaries with 60% and 37% of identified dolphins determined as residents, 26% and 21% as occasional visitors, and 14% and 42% as transients for the CR and RR, respectively. Resource partitioning was apparent in both estuaries with the mean distance resident dolphins were found upstream from the River mouth being greater than for the occasional visitors and transients.Tursiops aduncus was seen all year round in the CR and RR estuaries, with peak sightings occurring in spring at both sites. In the CR the dolphin population showed consistent seasonal fluctuations, whereas this did not occur in the RR population. In the CR the largest spatial distribution of dolphins in the estuary was observed in spring and winter, while in summer they were primarily restricted to the main estuary channel. Different behaviours that were observed; feeding, socialising, travelling, and milling and resting, were found to be influenced by season, tidal phase and tidal range. In both estuaries the core habitat areas used by the population for feeding consisted of areas with considerable slope near the edge of tidal sand banks, adjacent to deeper channels at the entrances of canals, creeks or artificial breakwalls. In addition, the core habitat areas used by the population for milling and resting behaviour in both estuaries occurred in shallow, sheltered areas, often associated with seagrass beds.  Socialising occurred more frequently in the CR throughout most of the deeper waters of the estuary, whereas in the RR it was primarily restricted to a small area of medium depth in the estuary.The major determinant of T. aduncus occupancy in the two estuaries was the flood events that occurred, which resulted in the dolphins abandoning the estuary. The mean predicted probabilities for sighting dolphins during non-flood periods were 0.87 and 0.71, during a flood 0.21 and 0.04, and during a post-flood recovery period 0.83 and 0.80 in the CR and RR, respectively. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed that when the dolphins were absent from the estuaries, three components were extracted from the water quality parameters in the CR, and two components in the RR. High loadings from the PCA were associated with the changing salinity, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen and temperature associated with the flood events. The return of the dolphins to the estuary following a flood depended on the length and severity of the flood event, but generally the dolphins seemed to prefer waters with salinity levels above 29 &#8240;. This could be associated with higher salinities being important for their physiological health, or because their prey returned to the estuaries during these higher salinity conditions, more likely a combination of both of these factors.Sexual segregation patterns were observed in T. aduncus populations with mixed gender and female groups mainly recorded in the CR, whereas in the RR female groups dominated the estuary. In the CR, significant differences occurred in sightings between the mixed and female groups in relation to water depth and behaviour. Mixed gender groups were sighted predominantly in deeper water and were involved in social behaviour including sexual behaviour and male herding of females. In contrast, the female groups were observed across all water depths, predominately feeding and also participating in more milling and resting behaviours.The high occurrence of aggressive herding behaviour by males in the CR was significantly different at varying depths, tides and seasons, occurring more often in deeper water, at higher tides and in non-breeding seasons. Female groups were found to utilise the small, shallow tributaries and travel for longer distances up these smaller tributaries than the mixed groups, which were concentrated in the deeper main channel of the estuary.The deeper water of the channels may facilitate the males in herding the females, while the female groups&#8217; habitat selection of shallow estuary areas may provide a sanctuary from aggressive males, access to suitable prey items or prey density for mothers and their calves, or a combination of these factors.This study has provided the first detailed research on T. aduncus dolphin population dynamics, habitat use, occupancy and sexual segregation patterns in two Australian subtropical estuaries. To ensure the long-term survival of both of these dolphin populations, management of future increased anthropogenic disturbances from boat traffic, pollution, dolphin watching, industrial or urban development, over-fishing and habitat degradation of the catchment is needed. Good quality water conditions, the protection of the core feeding areas and small shallow tributaries for females and their calves, and sheltered areas for resting behaviour all need to be maintained for the continued conservation of these important dolphin populations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bottlenose dolphin</field><field name="subject">habitat use</field><field name="subject">Clarence River</field><field name="subject">Richmond River</field><field name="subject">animal behaviour</field><field name="subject">populations size</field><field name="subject">flood impacts</field><field name="subject">sexual segregation</field><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">site fidelity</field><field name="subject">abundance</field><field name="subject">Animal Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/89</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Walking two worlds: transformational journals of nurse healers, a hermeneutic phenomenological investigation.</field><field name="creator">Hemsley, Martin</field><field name="description">This research investigated the transformative and extraordinary experiences of nurse healers. The broad aim of the research was to promote the role of the healer in nursing by providing data on the experiences specific to nurse healers&#8217; evolution as healers. The research was theoretically informed by van Manen (1990, 1984) and utilised hermeneutic phenomenology. Van Manen&#8217;s emphasis on writing as the key element of phenomenology in lived experience research was employed to bring forth a sense of lived immediacy and aesthetic colour essential to phenomenological understanding. The thesis was also theoretically aligned with the conceptual model of nursing as a caring-healing profession, developed by Jean Watson (1999, 1990a, 1988, 1985a). In particular, this research drew on Watson&#8217;s explicit connection of nursing with healing and nursing practice with transformational, transpersonal and esoteric insights. There were eleven nurse (nine women and two men) participants in the study. All participants identified strongly as healers. Selection was based on how long, and important to the individual was their commitment to being a healer. The data collection method used was semi structured interview with a predominant focus on storytelling. The overarching theme of &#8216;Walking Two Worlds&#8217; was identified, and within that five essential themes were uncovered: (1) Belonging &amp; Connecting; (2) Opening to Spirit; (3) Summoning; (4) Wounding &amp; Healing Journey; and (5) Living as a Healer. Implications for nursing discussed include the need for the profession to provide support to nurse healers as they encounter challenging experiences and to allow for ontological flexibility regarding the esoteric aspects of human/spiritual experience revealed by this research. Further the need to extend the understanding invoked by healing beyond the obvious and opening vistas into experience which have been previously repudiated by domineering, narrow and spirit-denying powers in our society is also discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">healers</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">holism</field><field name="subject">Watson's theory</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">research</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/22</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The policies and procedures for governance and administration that non-government schools in Queensland could use to achieve and maintain accreditation under the Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001</field><field name="creator">Austen, Steven Roy</field><field name="description">Non-government schools in Queensland must be accredited by the Non-State Schools Accreditation Board established by the Queensland Government under the Education(Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Act 2001 in order to operate the school.In 2005, there were 457 non-government schools registered in Queensland with the Non-State Schools Accreditation Board (Non-State Schools Accreditation Board 2005). The enrolment of 207,859 students constituted approximately 30 per cent of student enrolments in the State. Government funding to non-government schools is substantial  (general recurrent funding of $303 million was provided by the Queensland government in 2002) (Non-State Schools Accreditation Board 2005).The accreditation criteria set out in the Act are: the school&#8217;s administration and governance arrangements; the school&#8217;s financial viability; the school&#8217;s educational program and student welfare processes; the school&#8217;s resources; and the school&#8217;s improvement processes. The Education (Accreditation of Non-State Schools) Regulation 2001 provides further details on the requirements of the accreditation for all criteria, except for governance and administration criterion. This is the major gap addressed by this research.The methodology for doing so was:&#8226; a theoretical framework for effective corporate governance developed from the relevant literature&#8226; case studies of six non-government schools with a range of ownership/governance models to identify their current governance policies and practices and to compare them with the theoretical framework to assess their effectiveness&#8226; a suite of policies and procedures based on the theoretical framework and &#8220;standout&#8221; practice from the six case study schools that would provide an effective corporate governance practice for non-government schools.The potential clients of this research are:&#8226; The Office of Non-State Education&#8226; Independent Schools Queensland (&#8220;ISQ&#8221;)&#8226; Auspicing denomination or other ownership group of schools, their governing bodies and the auditors of non-government schools; including, but not only, the case study schools&#8226; Newly accredited schools wishing to start well.

This study combines a consideration of questions of social structure as they pertain to jobless families at the theoretical level with an ethnographic journey into their life worlds. It aims to understand the impact of long-term joblessness upon the families and to explore the interconnections between system and life world.I adopt Layder&#8217;s (1997, 1998) theoretical and methodological formulations as the most appropriate means to underpin an investigation of this nature. The study is comprehensively situated within a structural context which examines discourses and events that have exerted an influence on our present social arrangements, including an analysis of relevant social policy. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with two non-purposive samples and analysed using a modified Grounded Theory approach as advocated by Layder (1998).It was found that the current welfare regime helps to stabilise the capitalist global economy and does at least provide a precarious stability for those excluded from the labour market. Whilst families receiving long-term income support are not a homogeneous group, they are subject to hidden injuries in common. The linkages between system and life world are theorised in terms of the displacement principle, which holds that the displacement of a problem does not solve it, but merely relocates it elsewhere. It is used to explain both large-scale displacements as well as micro processes occurring within jobless families. Long-term joblessness is found often to have destructive consequences for intimacy, though family structure may remain intact. This is partly due to a welfare regime which disrespects its beneficiaries. I argue that social policy must be informed by an alternative discourse which includes social or welfare rights as a part of human rights, based upon recognition of mutual interdependency and an ethic of care. This is vital if future policy directions are to accord equal respect to all citizens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">joblessness</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">welfare state</field><field name="subject">Family, Life Course, and Society</field><field name="subject">Social Welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/56</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of internship in developing industry-relevant management competencies in tourism and hospitality graduates</field><field name="creator">Walo, Maree Ann</field><field name="description">Industry practitioners and educators both agree that tourism and hospitality management curricula need to reflect recent and future industry needs and developments, to ensure graduates are equipped with appropriate and industry-relevant skills. Furthermore, the combination of theory with practice is viewed as an essential component of a student&#8217;s tourism and hospitality management education. In the past, limited attempts have been made to provide empirical support to claims that a practical internship experience develops management competence in tourism and hospitality management students. In addition, Australian research into the management competencies employers in tourism and hospitality industries expect of recent graduates is minimal. Given the proliferation of tourism and hospitality-related courses over the past decade and the relative importance attributed to internship in developing students&#8217; management competencies, such evaluations are considered important.Thus, this study focused on three main research objectives which were; to identify the management competencies that managers of organisations within tourism and hospitality industries expect of recent tourism and hospitality graduates; to determine whether students&#8217; management competencies are developed during the internship component of Southern Cross University&#8217;s Bachelor of Business in Tourism degree; and to determine whether the management competencies of Southern Cross University&#8217;s Bachelor of Business in Tourism students meet the expectations of selected managers of organisations in four tourism and hospitality sectors. The study utilised the 24 management competencies and eight roles of Quinn, Thompson, Faerman and McGrath&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework (CVF) to test two research hypotheses. The first hypothesis proposed that students&#8217; pre-internship mean scores will be significantly lower than their post-internship mean scores with respect to the 24 management competencies and eight managerial roles associated with Quinn et al.&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework. The second hypothesis proposed that students&#8217; post-internship mean scores will not be significantly lower than the selected managers&#8217; mean scores with respect to the 24 management competencies and eight managerial roles associated with Quinn et al.&#8217;s (1990) Competing Values Framework. A specific survey instrument, the Self Assessment of Managerial Skills (DiPadova, 1990), was used to survey managers within four sectors of Australian tourism and hospitality industries and Bachelor of Business in Tourism internship students from Southern Cross University in Lismore, Australia. Students were surveyed before and after internship.The study found that students&#8217; perceptions of their level of managerial competence had significantly increased after the completion of their internship placement in six of the 24 management competencies and three of the eight managerial roles, thus partially supporting the first research hypothesis. Further, it was found that pre-internship, students perceived these six competencies were their weakest competency areas, with one exception - Presenting Information by Writing Effectively. This suggests that internship has complemented competencies developed during their coursework. The study also found that after completing internship, students&#8217; perceptions of their managerial competence were reasonably congruent with the expectations of this sample of managers, thus supporting the second research hypothesis. In this study students&#8217; post-internship competencies were found to be reasonably aligned with Quinn, Faerman and Dixit&#8217;s (1987) research which examined the relationship between management competencies and hierarchical levels in an organisation. Empirical data collected from the students and the managers, identified students&#8217; management profiles preand post-internship and the management profile that managers expect of recent graduates.  These profiles resembled Quinn&#8217;s (1991) description of a Master Manager. These findings suggest that internship has assisted students in moving closer to the competence required of a Master Manager.The study concludes that the internship component of a student&#8217;s tourism and hospitality education can hold real educational benefits in preparing them for future management roles. Also, as entry level graduates, this cohort of students has the ability to demonstrate competence over a range of transferable generic management competencies and should be effectively equipped to undertake a range of managerial opportunities that may be presented to them. The study demonstrates the importance of conducting empirically based evaluation to provide support to the debate on the true educational value of internship and highlights the need for further research in this area. It also demonstrates the application of the eight management roles and 24 management competencies of the CVF (Quinn et al., 1990) to tourism and hospitality industries.With the recent proliferation of tourism and hospitality management programs, tertiary education providers are now being held more accountable for the courses they offer. Curricula must reflect the changing needs of industry. Research in collaboration with tourism and hospitality industries must continue to ensure that courses offered are not only relevant but are also producing graduates with skills and knowledge they will need as future managers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management competencies</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/48</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the achievement of success in e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry: a case study of the Shanghai Brilliance Group</field><field name="creator">Xuan, Weibing</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of the internet and e-commerce provide new opportunities for China&#8217;s retailers, and a new battle for China&#8217;s retail industry has begun. The purpose of this research is to explore the barriers and factors for achieving successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry. Some past studies have investigated the success of e-commerce in the western context. This study aims to partially fill the gap created by the lack of research into e-commerce in the Asian context, by investigating successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry, and is based on a case study of the Shanghai Brilliance Group. Therefore, the research question is &#8216;How can successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry be achieved?&#8217; Accordingly, three research issues are addressed:Research issue 1: How is e-tailing being used in the Shanghai Brilliance Group?Research issue 2: What are the barriers to the implementation of e-tailing in theShanghai Brilliance Group?Research issue 3: What are the factors for achieving successful e-tailing in theShanghai Brilliance Group?To investigate the research question and the three research issues, the following approaches were applied. Firstly, three parent disciplines were reviewed, namely, ecommerce, retail in China, and e-tailing success factors, in order to generate the research gap and a theoretical model. A theoretical model was developed, which included six factors and their variables. These six factors are: senior management factors, organisational factors, e-commerce strategies, external factors, consumer factors, and ecommerce system measurements. Secondly, the primary data for this research were collected from interviews (16 in-depth interviews and 3 focus group interviews) and a survey questionnaire (200 valid questionnaires).The findings for the first research issue showed that e-commerce is poorly implemented in the Shanghai Brilliance Group and its subsidiaries, but that e-commerce in the supermarket subsidiaries is more advanced than in the department stores. Only one department store is offering online shopping to their customers, while both supermarket subsidiaries offer online shopping. The rest of the department stores only use websites for advertising and promotion, or for limited customer service, such as award point checking. Moreover, only the Oriental Shopping Centre and Lian Hua Supermarket have specific teams or an out-sourced company controlling their e-commerce project. This shows that e-commerce is not being taken seriously in the Shanghai Brilliance Group to date.In relation to the second research issue, a total of nineteen barriers were identified from the interview data. Those barriers can be divided into two categories, namely, external barriers and internal barriers. Most of those barriers are consistent with those mentioned in the literature. However, some new barriers emerged from the data analysis process, including the mission of the organisation, and high profit objectives.The findings in relation to research issue 3 identified other important factors of e-tailing, besides those barriers answered in research issue 2. Most of the success factors reviewed in the literature were confirmed by the collected data and in addition, some new variables were explored. Overall, six groups of factors and 64 variables were addressed in this research as success factors for e-tailing. This included 57 out of the 59 variables which were previously mentioned in the literature and seven emergent variables.This research has made a contribution to both the theory and practice of e-tailing.Through qualitative analysis, this research not only identifies the important factors of e-tailing, but also generates a comprehensive model to guide the implementation of e-tailing by China&#8217;s retailers, especially the Shanghai Brilliance Group. Furthermore, this is the first study to investigate successful e-tailing in China&#8217;s retail industry. Accordingly, the proposed framework of this study provides a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-tailing</field><field name="subject">China retail industry</field><field name="subject">success factors</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">E-Commerce</field><field name="subject">International Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/49</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Putting the spin on wind energy: risk management issues associated with wind energy project development in Australia</field><field name="creator">Finlay-Jones, Richard</field><field name="description">The debate on global warming is over (Stix, 2006 p24). The global community must now find ways to reduce greenhouse emissions, particularly from energy generation. Wind energy provides one of the potential solutions to generate renewable energy without creating harmful greenhouse gases. Wind energy is the fastest growing energy generation industry globally (&#8216;Operating wind power capacity' 2006a). This rapid growth is being driven by increasing global energy demand, commitment from governments globally to international agreements including the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC 1997) to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, as well as individual country commitments to mandatory renewable energy targets. Australia, whilst being a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has so far failed to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. In Australia, wind energy development to date has been driven primarily by the development of the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target (MRET) under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000. This requires a commitment to 2% of total electricity generation (9,500GW) to be derived from renewable energy sources by the year 2010 (Warwryk, undated). It is now understood, that the current federal obligation to renewable energy is now oversubscribed, and consequently the likelihood of further wind energy projects being developed is highly limited (Brazzale 2005). External to the government commitment to renewable energy, the development of wind energy projects requires a range of inputs including, but not limited to; an understanding of the wind resource, security of land, access to suitable electricity transmission grid, a market for the electricity, access to suitable technology and a level of community support. Whilst the literature related to project management and risk management is extensive, the literature related to the risks associated with wind energy development in Australia is limited. This research then seeks to fill a void that asks the question; How can project managers minimise the risk associated with wind energy developments in Australia? To investigate this research problem, comparative case study analysis was adopted as a methodology utilising a structured interview process of project managers responsible for the development of 8 Australian wind energy projects. This research shows that the greatest risk to Australian projects is the lack of security associated with the current federal legislation and the consequent loss of market value of the power from wind energy projects. A number of additional primary and secondary risks are identified by the interview participants, and the research is able to draw out three common themes of risk management strategies. These three themes were categorised as conservatism, due diligence and proactivism. This study contributes to the research associated with project management, risk management and wind energy development. This insight into the Australian wind energy industry provides policy makers, educators and stakeholders with information to assist in improving the political, economic and social environment for further wind energy development, in order to mitigate against further greenhouse gas emission and combat global warming.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wind energy</field><field name="subject">risk management</field><field name="subject">global warming</field><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources and Conservation</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/23</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of business/management education, to small enterprise solvency</field><field name="creator">Ellis, Peter</field><field name="description">The aim of the research thesis was to identify whether or not the delivery of management education at base level, made a significant contribution to small enterprise solvency. Research by Williams (1986) indicated that over 60% of insolvent small enterprise (SE) owners gave one reason for insolvency as: &#8216;a lack of business/management experience or skill&#8217;. This implies that a significant percentage of SE insolvencies were avoidable, had the SE owner/managers acquired further business skill, knowledge or support. Literature suggests that increased business/management competencies may enable management blind spots within the internal activity structure of some enterprises, to be brought into focus and so controlled (Williams, 1984). This thesis undertakes research, to identify the contribution of various management education programs to SE solvency. The methodology used to test this contribution to business management knowledge, comprised surveys of management education facilitators and program participants, by education institutions from Government and private Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and Government and private non-RTOs. The objective was to determine, through the use of quantitative surveys, if a significant difference could be established between educational facilities offered and small enterprise owner/manager requirements, with the intention to make this an initial exploratory research. The thesis examined perceptions of SE owner/managers participating in management education programs and whether there is a contribution to the solvency of businesses from an educational framework that gives SE owners who lack crucial business/management skills, direction towards specific information, knowledge and abilities. The intention was to bridge research gaps concerning levels of SE solvency and skill-education available using four major types of business educational organisations. The study included interviews with SE owner/managers participating in business programs to identify their perception of the contribution by courses to the solvency of their enterprises. The research examined whether there was a significant difference in certain clusters and competencies between researched management programs, to establish if completing any program affected positively, levels of SE solvency. Since the research focus was on the impacts of management education on SE solvency, another outcome was to profile the participants who reported positive and negative perceptions of the impact of SE management education courses on SE solvency. These results are documented in full in Appendix &#8216;C&#8217;.  Positive perceptions The group of participants, that generally saw courses as having positive affects on SE solvency, had the following characteristics.  Predominantly male with education levels above high school level up to VET registered certificate, aged between 26-47 years, wishing to build their solvency and management skills, and wanting to focus on assistance from mentors/consultants on goals and business plans.  Negative perceptions Course participants who perceived negative attitudes to the impact of courses in SE solvency had characteristics below. Predominantly female with primary school or trade qualifications, bur not VET certified, up to 25 years old or between the ages of 48 and 55 years, and not interested in building business or management skills. The courses they attended did not focus on goal setting and the participants had little interest in working with mentors or consultants. Conclusion The body of knowledge relating to SE solvency was extended as a result of this study, through working directly with management course participants. This research concludes by advancing the theory that education of business owner/managers is not solely to be focussed on management competencies. A complete business education should include character development and business activity planning, as well as business/management competencies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business management education solvency</field><field name="subject">education solvency</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/20</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retailers&#8217; perceptions of product brand equity: an empirical study of Vietnamese independent grocers</field><field name="creator">Tran, Quan Ha Minh</field><field name="description">In the literature on product branding, significant attention has been paid to brand equity in the consumer context, but relatively little attention has been paid to the application of the concept of brand equity to the business-to-business context. Even less research has been conducted on the role of brand equity in the retailing context. Retailers are assumed to be irrelevant to the source of brand value for manufacturers, with the result that manufacturers do not target retailers to help them build strong brands. Therefore, there is potential for some channel conflict to occur between manufacturers and retailers. On the one hand, retailers may tend to focus on building their own, private brands to differentiate themselves from other retail competitors and to increase their power in relation to manufacturer brands. On the other hand, retailers also need to create a good image in the consumer marketplace by selling famous, manufacturer-branded products. In other words, retailers often have to sell famous brands even if they would prefer to sell other brands, or their own. Manufacturers therefore tend to focus on building strong brand associations in consumers&#8217; minds, in order to control retailers&#8217; power.There is an argument that traditional ways of thinking about brands, i.e. only from the consumer perspective, has produced &#8216;both an incomplete analysis of branding from an academic perspective and incomplete management of the brand from a company perspective&#8217; (Webster 2000). The relationship between manufacturers and retailers should be viewed as a partnership instead of competition for consumer loyalty (Narus &amp; Anderson 1986). Powerful consumer brands not only provide value to manufacturers and consumers, but they also offer many obvious benefits to retailers. These benefits include an established consumer demand; favourable consumer attitudes towards the branded product found in their store; a commitment from manufacturers to promote their products; and the credibility and image of the brand itself as an enhancement of the retailer&#8217;s own credibility and image(Webster 2000). Brand equity, therefore, needs to be investigated from the retailers&#8217; perspective, in order to provide a more complete understanding of the role of branding in marketing strategies. This research attempts to bridge this gap by exploring the customer-based brand equity concept from the retailers&#8217; perspective. It aims to explore how consumer-based brand equity theory translates to the retailer context, incorporating the key constructs of brand association, brand trust, brand loyalty, manufacturer support and the performance of the brand.The study was conducted in the context of the Vietnamese independent retail grocery sector. This context was chosen on the basis that there has been limited research conducted on branding in the Vietnamese context and due to the prominence of the independent grocery sector in the retail industry of Viet Nam. A survey questionnaire was developed based on the review of the relevant branding and retail literature and was administered to a sample of 400 independent grocery retailers in Ho Chi Minh City. This sample was drawn from a commercial mailing list of independent retailers. Selected retailers were contacted by phone and invited to participate in the research by completing the questionnaire during a face-to-face interview at their premises. They were asked to respond to the survey in relation to a major brand of soft drink sold within their product range. The soft drink product category was selected for this study due to it being one of the most common types of products sold by the independent retail sector in Viet Nam, which would ensure that all participants could easily share their opinions of the value of brands.Following a pilot study testing the survey instrument, the main data collection phase resulted in 355 completed and useable surveys being available for analysis. Structural equation modeling was used to explore the relationships between the branding constructs of interest. The findings show that the theoretical model has fit with the data. Nine out of twelve hypotheses are supported to answers four research question.The finding indicates that brand equity plays an important role in the retailing context, and it is comprised of three dimensions - brand association, brand trust and brand loyalty. Brand association is reflected in the positive image of a brand in the retailer&#8217;s perception, related to their needs and wants. This leads to a positive feeling towards that brand, which is the trust a retailer holds in a manufacturer&#8217;s brand. As the result of a strong brand, retailers commit to a long-term business relationship with the brand&#8217;s manufacturer. Two of these three dimensions of retailer-based brand equity, (brand association and brand loyalty) are positively and significantly related to the brand&#8217;s performance at the retail outlet. Manufacturer support, including advertising, sales promotion and trade promotions has been confirmed by this study to be an antecedent of retailer-based brand equity. Moreover, this study indicated that there is a difference between the retailer-based brand equity model for local brands compared to international brands, in that brand association is the most important factor in retailer-based brand equity in the international brands model while brand loyalty is the most important factor in the local brands model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retailer based brand equity</field><field name="subject">brand equity</field><field name="subject">retail trade Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/46</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How and why credibility-based company logos are effective in marketing communication in persuading customers to take action: a multiple case study toward a better understanding of creativity in branding</field><field name="creator">Haig, William</field><field name="description">This thesis continues to explore guidelines for logo designers to more effectively plan and create company logos. Also, how the current low trust in company Web Sites can be improved with the company logo. Credibility-based logo design is introduced as the underlying principle for both logo design and Web Site improvement. As such, this thesis explores the application of source credibility studies in communication persuasion to the planning and creative development of company logos. Credibility-based logo design theory is developed in a multiple case study which includes applying credibility-based logo design to improve the effectiveness of company Web Sites. The study has two stages. The inductive stage of this case study develops the credibility-based logo design theory, including actual development of company logos based on this theory. The deductive stage tests credibility-based logo design using the Internet and Web analytics for data collection. The research accomplishes two purposes: 1.     To validate credibility-based logo design theory for marketing communication persuasion effectiveness. 2.     To validate that credibility-based logo design will increase the effectiveness of company Web Sites by giving the visitor trust and confidence in the company to take desired action toward a purchase decision. The case study results support the hypothesis that credibility-based logo design theory can be applied to creating more effective company logo design. And, company Web Sites with a credibility-based logo design are twice to four times more effective compared to Web Sites with a non-credible logo. &#8216;More effective&#8217; means more clickthrough action on the Web Site navigation bar to achieve various company goals, most often a purchase decision. In summary, there are two major contributions: 1.      Advancing the knowledge of company logo design through effective logo planning and design creativity based on source-credibility principles. 2.      Advancing the knowledge of Web Site effectiveness through a company credibility-based logo design. A third contribution is in advancing the knowledge for using the Internet to conduct &#8216;live action&#8217; research and data collection. This has further implications for testing Internet advertising and other visual on-line and off-line marketing elements. The results of this study are important for logo designers, company managers, and Web Site designers. As an epilogue, this thesis extends the credibility basis for creating logos to creating all marketing communication to achieve a total brand personality as credible for a given company. This is termed Brand Credibility with implications for a better measurement of brand equity. This thesis builds on the important logo design work by Pamela Henderson, Joseph Cote and Jim Hutton; and the important branding work of David Aaker, Kevin Lane Keller, Jennifer Aaker, and Tulin Erdem.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Advertising and Promotion Management</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/6</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Listening to refugee bodies: The naturopathic encounter as a cross-cultural meeting place</field><field name="creator">Singer, Judy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the meanings of naturopathy through the experiences of twelve women with refugee backgrounds involved in naturopathic treatment at the Victorian Foundation for Survivors of Torture (Foundation House), a refugee torture and trauma rehabilitation service in Melbourne, Australia. The findings of this research show that the naturopathic encounter provided a transformative and meaningful meeting place for healing, a place in which the women felt at ease and in place.At Foundation House naturopathy has been practised alongside counselling since 1989, two years after the organisation&#8217;s inception. The women I interviewed for this project came from diverse sociocultural backgrounds and a wide range of countries including Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, Burma and Serbia.The thesis brings together two contemporary fields of practice: Western models of refugee health care and traditional medicine. It argues for the place of non-biomedical approaches in refugee health care in a Western setting. The thesis takes an interdisciplinary approach to theorise the naturopathic encounter. The distinction between holistic and reductionist perspectives on health, illness and the body is underpinned by the theoretical work of medical anthropologists Nancy Scheper-Hughes and Margaret Lock and that of medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky. A cultural studies perspective, influenced by the work of embodiment scholar Elspeth Probyn is employed to theorise these women&#8217;s experiences of the naturopathic encounter.This qualitative study is based on in-depth interviews and draws on grounded theory as an approach to data analysis. Descriptions of respite, renewal, and healing in the naturopathic encounter are cited as the most observable themes emerging from the women&#8217;s stories. These themes represent a health-oriented, as opposed to a disease-focused, perspective. Importantly, a health-orientated approach is congruent with the core tenets of naturopathic philosophy. Listening to the body is a crucial therapeutic tool in the naturopathic encounter, where primacy is given to supporting and strengthening health-creating strategies. I argue that this orientation disrupts the existing dominant biomedical approach to refugee health care. I draw on the work of Probyn to theorise the movement from the naturopathic encounter (NE) to the naturopathic meeting place (NMP). Central to this transposition is Probyn&#8217;s articulation of the body&#8217;s awareness of being in and out of place. This awareness lends itself to an understanding of the connectedness between past and present in the bridge-making that these particular refugee women have engaged in across cultures in the NMP.The thesis addresses an important but often neglected focus in refugee research: the resilience and agency of refugees. This positive aspect of refugee recovery is revealed in the research by theorising the women&#8217;s stories through Probyn&#8217;s embodiment analysis and cognisance of the &#8216;everyday&#8217; as a productive and creative process. The research interrupts the ubiquitous image of the &#8216;disempowered refugee victim&#8217;. It highlights the practical wisdom and agency of these particular women that is often overshadowed in the complex resettlement process. It makes a call for further health-orientated research to broaden and deepen our understanding of the refugee experience.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">naturopathy</field><field name="subject">refugee women</field><field name="subject">western herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">traditional medicine</field><field name="subject">refugee health care</field><field name="subject">qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Antonovsky</field><field name="subject">Probyn</field><field name="subject">Habitus</field><field name="subject">medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/81</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of P450 gene(s) in barley (Hordeum vulgare)</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Linh</field><field name="description">In plants, P450 enzymes encoded by P450 genes play a central role in numerous biosynthetic pathways, such as the production of secondary metabolites, stress responses and disease resistance. This thesis reports upon the utilization of molecular biology techniques to study P450 gene(s) in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).Using several combinations of degenerate primers, a large number of barley P450 gene fragments were cloned and sequenced from two commercial varieties, Chebec and Harrington. Among 247 isolated sequences, twenty six percent were homologous to genes of known function. The abundance of these sequences differed between the two cultivars. Variations in the motif sequences of the cloned genes were also found between these two cultivars. In addition to the cloned fragments, twenty-two putative barley P450 encoding genes were identified from 24,000 cereal sequences in the International Triticeae EST Cooperative (ITEC) database by homology search. Among these Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequences, a full-length P450 sequence was selected for further investigation in this study.This novel P450 gene, CYP72A39, was expressed at a very early vegetative stage, but no expression was detected at the reproductive stage. Comparison of expression profiles of this gene and &#8220;digital expression&#8221; databases confirmed that this gene was homologous to several cereal EST clones with tissue-specific transcripts responding to various environmental stimuli, such as stresses and disease. Among these, many transcripts in barley were obtained from stressed tissues at the vegetative stage, and two transcripts in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were expressed after being challenged by barley powdery mildew pathogen (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei L.). This suggested that CYP72A39 may play a defence role in the barley seedling.The secondary structure of CYP72A39 was investigated in a comparative analysis using a computational approach. However, attempts to express CYP72A39 in a heterologous system and functional assays of the native protein in barley did not give decisive results, due to the disordered structure of the native protein and limitations of the current method. Screening the 3&#8217; UnTranslated Region (3&#8217;UTR) of this gene in 158 genotypes of domesticated, landrace and wild barley revealed two haplotypes, which differed by a 12 base indel positioned between two transversions. The presence of both haplotypes in wild and cultivated barley suggests this polymorphism predates the domestication of barley. This indel was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 6H, less than 10 centi-Morgans (cM) from the gene encoding resistance to powdery mildew in barley (B. graminis). A comparison between haplotype diversity and powdery mildew resistance data for over 102 genotypes showed a weak link between the &#8216;long&#8217; haplotype and resistance, while the &#8216;short&#8217; haplotype was associated with susceptibility. There was no evidence for a strong correlation between haplotype and quality type (malt or feed); however, more malting varieties had the long haplotype, suggesting a possible association with some attributes in modern malting barley. There was no evidence for association with other characteristics such as geographic origin, growth habit or row number. Phylogenetic relationship of the CYP72A39 to other CYP72 members was also investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">P450</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Hordeum vulgare</field><field name="subject">isolation</field><field name="subject">characterisation</field><field name="subject">Plant Breeding and Genetics</field><field name="subject">Plant Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/107</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the complexity of computer learning: journeying beyond teaching for computer competency to facilitating computer</field><field name="creator">Phelps, Renata</field><field name="description">For future generations to maximise their capability to operate within technologically driven economies, it is critical to foster computer abilities at every level of the schooling process. Teachers are central to this process. Yet, for many teachers, the need to integrate computer use in their teaching is threatening and overwhelming. This thesis argues that, given the rapid rate of technological change, skills-based approaches to computer education inadequately prepare teachers for a career of continued technological change. Effective computer education for teachers requires more than skills training. It involves changes in attitudes, values and beliefs that provide confidence for ongoing learning. Furthermore, it involves learning to adapt to change, to be flexible, intuitive and above all persistent. It requires the fostering of teachers who know how to be self-directed and independent in their computer learning, rather than those dependent on structured routines or guidelines. This thesis is the &#8216;story&#8217; of an action research initiative underpinned by a belief in the importance of approaches to computer education which foster lifelong computer learning. It traces the journey of a reflexive process of change and iterative development in the teaching of an educational information technology (computer) unit to pre-service teacher education students. Over a period of three years (1999-2001) I pursued a central research question, namely: How can I develop my teaching practice to better facilitate the development of capable computer users? The research explores the distinction between a &#8216;competent&#8217; and a &#8216;capable&#8217; computer user and trials a range of teaching and learning approaches that aim to facilitate the development of capable computer users.From this constructivist research and teaching process a multidimensional approach to computer education emerged, founded on metacognition and reflection. This approach is demonstrated to offer many advantages over a skills-focused approach. This thesis maps the complexity of the computer learning and teaching context, arguing that simplistic approaches to teaching will produce narrow and limited learning outcomes. Rather, a holistic approach is proposed, one that moves beyond the development of computer competency toward a longer term vision of facilitating computer capability. It is argued that the role of the computer &#8216;teacher&#8217; is to foster reflective awareness and develop a learning environment that can assist computer learners to become comfortable existing on the &#8216;edge of chaos&#8217;.This research supports previous studies which indicate the important role of computer self efficacy and the influence of factors such as perceived usefulness, anxiety, support and frequency and duration of use. However, the research also documents the unpredictable influence of these factors on individuals&#8217; resultant approach to computers and challenges dichotomous interpretations of such factors. Appropriate attribution is also shown to be a major influence on computer capability, as are factors such as help-seeking, motivation and goal-setting, although again, these influences are non-linear. It is argued that computer capability cannot be &#8216;taught&#8217; but, rather, computer educators should look to creating environments where its emergence can be facilitated. The metacognitive computer learning context developed and explored through this research is one such approach.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information and communication technology</field><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">IT</field><field name="subject">teacher professional learning</field><field name="subject">teacher education</field><field name="subject">metacognition</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">learning theories</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/67</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital dilemmas: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and interactive multimedia publishing, 1992 &#8211; 2002</field><field name="creator">Martin, Fiona R</field><field name="description">From the 1990s onwards the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) adopted a range of interactive multimedia activities: CD-ROM, web publishing, datacasting and interactive television. Drawing on extensive primary research, this thesis explores why the ABC pursued an interactive multimedia program under a neo-liberal rationality and how online publishing in particular has impacted on its role as a public service broadcaster. Drawing on neo-Foucauldian governmentality theory and Scott Lash&#8217;s critique of information, the thesis examines how the ABC operates as a technology of government in the transition to an informational society. While it considers the ABC as a localised, specific form of public service broadcasting, many of the findings have importance for analysis within the broader field of state intervention in media markets. It demonstrates that networked interactive multimedia are a communications strategy appropriate to the governance of a globally implicated market-state during a period of informationalisation &#8211; characterised by increased symbolic flows, spatial and temporal compression, decontextualised and disorderly relations of information. Public service media will transition this period, characterised by rapid social change and institutional upheaval, where they can incorporate and exploit the informational relations that threaten to diminish their utility as governmental assemblage. It finds that while ABC executives used technological change to adapt to the enterprise focus of neo-liberal government, the corporation was simultaneously transformed by disorganisational influences pursuing an ethics of internetworking. Contrary to Lash&#8217;s ideal schema of institutional decline, disorganisation &#8211; embodied in the ad hoc, program-maker led push for internet access and publishing &#8211; can become a force for organisational renewal. This is observable in the development of ABC Online, a public access web service. The conclusion drawn from ABC Online&#8217;s emergence is that the era of digitalisation exposes the ABC as a mutable object, a flexible strategy of national communications governance. It is not exclusively tied to a technical system, such as radio or television, or a practice such as broadcasting. Interactive multimedia such as ABC Online may help the ABC to readdress its contradictory political rationale &#8211; the call to represent a coherent national identity in the face of infinite lived diversity &#8211; and play a new role in connecting and engaging its users.This thesis re-examines that role in light of Lash&#8217;s observations about the nature of informational power. It explores at length the response to a new self-governing, performative subject, the user of interactive multimedia technology. The user, unlike the audience, is visible, often vocal and social. She negotiates both the space of a multimedia object and dialogic interactions within that space. Her exemplary expertise may rival that of the ABC&#8217;s program-makers. This analysis indicates that in response to informational phenomena, the ABC has reconceived its space of government, its pedagogy and its production of citizenship in order to remain an effective expression of governmentality. An online ABC may act as a mediatory, contextualising strategy that helps users negotiate the construction and function of difference. It may also be altered by user knowledge. These relations are possible, although preliminary in this research, while the ABC remains wedded to the more disciplinary relations of broadcasting. The implication is that a digitally networked ABC should not be a self-enclosed institution. It is part of an informational network: a multi-sector innovation system. It should not be divorced from its public or the market except in its ethics of exchange. It is a technology that through its technocultural relations socialises, is shaped by and melds with its sometimes unruly user/citizens. It influences, is influenced by and is part of a volatile mediascape. The ABC is organisation and disorganisation, the rigidity of the one generating the other and then being reincorporated, in a cycle of institutional and industrial change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public service broadcasting</field><field name="subject">national broadcasting</field><field name="subject">new media</field><field name="subject">internet</field><field name="subject">online media</field><field name="subject">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">informational society</field><field name="subject">Michael Foucault</field><field name="subject">Scott Lash</field><field name="subject">online journalism</field><field name="subject">cultural policy</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">Film and Media Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/66</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical evaluation of aspects of the tourism information commodity marketplace in Australia and some implications for innovation in tourism</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Andrew James</field><field name="description">There is a growing body of literature which discusses the importance of systems of innovation (SOI) to modern economies. Systems which are innovative are characterised by organisations and institutions which identify weaknesses in current technologies, pursue new ideas through research and development, develop and produce technological innovations, and apply or distribute these for the collective benefit of the system. The literature suggests a number of structures which contribute to fostering systems of innovation. Efficiency in the production and exchange of knowledge is one of these.Tourism has been described as an economic system and recent public policy has recognised the importance of the production and exchange of knowledge for innovation in tourism. The distribution (or presentation) of secondary information resources (also referred to as &#8220;commodities&#8221;) has received particular attention from policy makers. The totality of information resources which is presented to information marketplaces at a point in time can be described as the information stock. Past commentary on the stock of tourism information in Australia indicates that inefficiencies may exist in the presentation and exchange of these resources in the marketplace.This research proposes a model of the marketplace for the exchange of tourism information commodities, the Tourism Information Commodity Marketplace (TICM). The model is applied to testing and identifying weakness in current production and exchange processes in Australia. In the research, the stock which is presented to the market is located, identified, catalogued and tested against the model to identify whether there are marketplace inefficiencies in the form of leakages. Leakages are the costs which tourism firms and organisations face as they try to address information needs by procuring and applying secondary information commodities.The research shows that a proportion of the presented stock can be moved efficiently from suppliers to consumers and is capable of meeting information needs of consumers at a point in time. However, a range of presentation and demand-side issues are identified which reduce the potential for knowledge-based innovation in tourism systems. These relate to language, access, availability, reliability, validity and coverage aspects which are associated with the stock and demand-side characteristics.The implications of this research for policy makers and suppliers of tourism information commodities are that dissemination weaknesses, in particular, must be addressed for the contribution of secondary information resources to innovation in tourism to be fully realised. For informatics researchers, the TICM is a valuable and adaptable tool for depicting and assessing marketplace dynamics where information is the commodity for exchange. It augments the understanding of the innovative potential of tourism stocks for systems of innovation as well as identifying potential barriers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tourism infomatics</field><field name="subject">information management</field><field name="subject">tourism data</field><field name="subject">information marketplace</field><field name="subject">systems of innovation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/42</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grandparents raising their grandchildren: impact of the transition from a traditional grandparent role to a grandparent-as-parent role</field><field name="creator">Backhouse, Jan</field><field name="description">In many Western societies grandparents take on the role of occasional or short-term care providers of their grandchildren. However, recent years have witnessed a significant increase, both in Australia and overseas, in the number of children being raised by their grandparents due to the inability of the children&#8217;s parents to effectively meet their parenting responsibilities.This study is an interpretive inquiry that seeks to understand the meanings grandparents attach to their experiences of the grandparent-as-parent role, rather than the traditional grandparent role. The study also investigates how assuming the non-traditional grandparent role has influenced the identity of grandparent caregivers. A narrative inquiry approach was employed to &#8216;hear the voices&#8217; of 34 grandparents who were raising their grandchildren in NSW, Australia. In-depth interviews were conducted with each of the participants and their narratives were subsequently analysed through the lens of identity theory.Findings from the study reveal that grandparents experience a significant degree of roleidentity conflict in their grandparent-as-parent role. The loss of their traditional grandparent role, together with the shift in commitment to the grandparent-as-parent role, has resulted in a &#8216;space of difference&#8217; between the &#8216;ideal&#8217; and the &#8216;real&#8217; of being a grandparent. This &#8216;space of difference&#8217; is made up of a series of binary experiences described as myth/reality, visible/invisible, deserving/undeserving, voice/silenced, included/excluded, which appear to have consequentially impacted grandparents&#8217; selfesteem and self-verification processes. The study posits that grandparents lack adequate support, or doulia, resulting in a prevailing belief that their commitment to the grandparentas- parent role is not publicly acknowledged nor afforded the justice it deserves.The study concludes that both policy and practice in NSW have failed to recognise and address the complexity of experience, or the &#8216;space of difference&#8217; occupied by grandparents who are raising their grandchildren, and provides a number of recommendations in response to the grandparent experiences narrated through this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grandparents-as-parents</field><field name="subject">narrative enquiry</field><field name="subject">identity theory</field><field name="subject">role conflict</field><field name="subject">grandparents raising grandchildren</field><field name="subject">kinship care</field><field name="subject">Family, Life Course, and Society</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/79</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picking the pitch: a grounded theory study of the impact of equal opportunity officers on the culture of universities</field><field name="creator">Burrett, Ann Joan</field><field name="description">Equal opportunity offices have been described as agencies of organisational change, and the term &#8216;cultural change&#8217; has been used to describe aspects of equal opportunity work.Universities are sites of organisational cultures where equal opportunity officers have worked in Australia for the past decade.

These changes in universities provided the context for questions about the roles of equal opportunity officers in universities, and how they may have changed. This research investigated the practice of equal opportunity officers in universities by using a grounded theory approach to generate understandings about how this group of university staff may have impacted on university cultures. The study develops links between theories of culture and organisational change that was situated in the practices of equal opportunity officers.The research identified a central conceptual category that was described as &#8216;picking the pitch&#8217;, as the main theme in the work of equal opportunity officers in identifying issues and gaining support for a cultural change agenda. All of the preliminary themes that were identified, and the interactions, the observations and the analysis of culture were prerequisites for &#8216;picking the pitch&#8217;.The thesis uses the research for further reflection and integration of the goals of equal opportunity, and the means that were available to equal opportunity officers to achieve these goals. The interactions of power and influence, and some of the limitations on equal opportunity officers are discussed.In the thesis the usefulness of the concept of culture to equal opportunity officers is examined, along with the underpinning theories about the mind of humanity that contributed to their approach to their task.Finally, the thesis discusses the impact of the research for equal opportunity officers, and for the universities in which they worked.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">equal opportunity</field><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Inequality and Stratification</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/50</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The emergence of simple business models on the World Wide Web</field><field name="creator">Featherstone, Michael</field><field name="description">This research project began with the objective of obtaining a deeper understanding of the conduct of business on the Internet. Research regarding the overall performance of business on the Web has been limited due to several constraining factors. Firstly, the shear size, volume, and perceived complexity of business on the Web made it an imposing target for research. Secondly, the interdisciplinary nature of the field had an initial dampening effect on research activity. Kuhn (1962) describes this phenomenon as the insufficiency of methodological directives. He writes (p. 3) &#8216;Instructed to examine electrical or chemical phenomena, the man who is ignorant of these fields but who knows what it is to be scientific may legitimately reach any one of a number of incompatible conclusions. Among those legitimate possibilities, the particular conclusions he does arrive at are probably determined by his prior experience in the other fields&#8217;. Thirdly, academic interest in Web businesses was somewhat diminished by the bursting of the dot com bubble during 2000-2001 as evidenced by the fact that many academic programs in electronic commerce have been discontinued or significantly reduced (Featherstone, Ellis &amp; Borstorff 2004). Lastly, methodological issues arose which limited the application of previously available sampling methods. The impact of this meant that drawing representative samples of websites in order to examine business behaviour became a more complex endeavour. As a result, many fundamental questions regarding business on the Web have remained unanswered. For example, there has been no clear answer to the question of what new business models, if any, are evolving within the Web environment. What is the role of entrepreneurship employing the Web? What are the key elements or mechanisms driving business expansion in the Web? Some have suggested that Web use necessitates greater business cooperation than may be necessary in the non-virtual world. Is there evidence that this is so? This thesis addresses these questions. It accomplishes this by reducing the function of business on the Internet to its simplest element, the domain name, and by employing innovative methodologies to explore the business environment of the Web. Using Complexity and Network Theories as a contextual framework , and based upon a review of existing literature, this thesis develops a series of propositions regarding both the conduct and attributes of Web business, and proceeds to present evidence of confirmation or refutation of these propositions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-commerce</field><field name="subject">e-business</field><field name="subject">business models</field><field name="subject">domain names</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">network theory</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">E-Commerce</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="subject">Technology and Innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/21</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blitz: discursive bombardments in 'the war on terror'</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jennifer M</field><field name="description">This is a composite thesis realised in a sound installation titled Blitz: Discursive bombardments in &#8216;the war on terror&#8217; with a supporting exegesis. The exegesis offers a context for the project in sound art theory and practice, focussing specifically on the history of experimental &#8216;electrovocal&#8217; expressive forms. It provides an account of the artist&#8217;s perspectives on the topic itself: contemporary political discourse on themes of security and danger. The exegesis also defines the scope of the project and documents the creative process undergone to realise its outcome: an installation apparatus capable of folding visitors into a heightened sense of the zeitgeist of early 21st century Australia. The genealogy of the project is described in terms of pivotal decisions and insights, technologies and techniques used, and aesthetic and ethical concerns. The nexus of voice &#8211; its material and metaphorical resonances in public discourse &#8211; and technologies for recording, manipulating and circulating sound are central to the development of this apparatus. The core body of sounds used in the installation are the voices of politicians, media presenters, members of the public and &#8216;experts&#8217; and are presented in the form of short sound bites. These were sampled from many hours of recordings of news and current affairs material captured from Australian public broadcasters (radio and television, the ABC and SBS) over the pre-election months of 2004. The voices extol and debate diverse &#8216;angles&#8217; on the so-called &#8216;war on terror&#8217; and its physical enactments and outcomes in the war on Iraq. Other sounds offset the voices to enhance a sense of surreal ambience and introduce meanings through metaphor; children&#8217;s voices; rhythmically dripping taps; footsteps; ticking clocks; the drone of planes overhead. Various sound processing techniques are applied to samples and a sonic montage iscreated through random juxtapositions of sounds played synchronously from an assemblage of iPods. The figure of the labyrinth is central to the work on many levels, materially and metaphorically. It is used to structure movement through the installation space, a dimly lit &#8216;black box&#8217; studio of ten by eight metres. Against the traditional practice of silently &#8216;walking the labyrinth&#8217; as metaphor for a &#8216;journey within&#8217;, the Blitz labyrinth invites walkers to fold themselves into a dynamic field of allusions and aural messages and thereby to warp and shift the emerging play of meanings. The walk wends in and out of proximity to seven iPods set in small portable speakers and dispersed around the floor of the installation space. The &#8216;pods&#8217; broadcast playlists of sounds bites that play randomly in &#8216;shuffle&#8217; mode &#8211; against one another and against silences &#8211; to convey a sense of immersion in the discursive blitz of messages about terrorism and war from the media. The labyrinth is drawn out across the floor in dashed lines &#8211; made from small reflective rectangles that light up as visitors move around the space with torches &#8211; and is designed to suggest the feel of a road or a landing ground at night. The meandering trajectory of walking bodies around the curves of the labyrinth creates a choreography of audition, of moving and listening strategically to a barrage of sound from ever shifting perspectives. It invites walkers to listen for possibilities that may lie between and beyond the dominant narratives of western political leaders, to locate the gaps and silences. Beyond the pervasive noise of discourse normalised by politicians and the media, what is it that we might otherwise wish to hear and to speak?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">voice</field><field name="subject">media</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">sound art</field><field name="subject">sound installation</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">2004</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/12</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A farewell to meat: rendering ambivalence and transgression</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Cornelius</field><field name="description">This exegesis speaks to the body of work constructed over three years between February 2004 and April 2007, assembled and exhibited at the Lismore Regional Gallery in May 2007 under the title A Farewell To Meat: Rendering Ambivalence and Transgression. Written concurrently with the production of the paintings, this writing maps the literature surveyed and documents the studio research undertaken.This research consisted of collecting imagery from a wide range of sites and allowing it to trigger abductive pictorial responses. Erupting from this collecting process, social texts such as TV and radio news, cultural texts such as cinema and literature, and the subtext formed by my own dreams and nightmares were conflated to become a kind of mythology that informs the paintings and artist books in the exhibition. My studio research on one level, became a kind of phenomenological investigation that probed and responded to a media saturated consumer culture, whilst on another level, it seeks to facilitate the injection of an element of cognitive dissonance back into this culture.The resultant creative output utilises the efficacy of the image and the subversive power of metaphor to engage with several interconnected themes. These range from the dialectic of truth and illusion in the painted space, to power relations, marginalisation and the possibility of finding holes in that maze without exits we call &#8216;capitalism&#8217;. An ostensibly atavistic utilisation of figuration and oil paint is intended as a lucid rebuttal of 20th Century/modernist notions of minimalism and the so-called &#8216;end of painting&#8217;. The relationship within the paintings between the medium and the message (the paint and the illusion) seeks to operate like the drapery found in paintings from the Baroque era that antinomically both reveals and conceals the forms beneath it. This scopic contradiction serves as an anamorphosistic mirror which, in my own work, highlights the subterfuge and legerdemain currently operating behind the veil constituted by technology and contemporary mass culture.The goofy, cartoon-like nature of the paintings and the aleatory strategies deployed in their construction, bear witness to the profundity of play in contrast to the burdensome yoke of labour. The artist books articulate more fully the innovative nature of the research and complement the paintings in a way that adds the dynamic of a digital dimension to the more traditional methods of oil painting on canvas.As a crassly instrumental reason insists on tightening its grip on human affairs, everywhere emphasising efficiency over playfulness, and as coercive structures of order continue to reduce my ontic options to an ever-diminishing range of superlatively insipid and uninteresting purchasing &#8216;choices&#8217;, the capacity for play, for ridiculousness, for absurdity, noise and laziness, for me, became symbolically central.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/11</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary theory: a 'good' explanatory framework for research into technological innovation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Stephen Keir</field><field name="description">This study attempts to answer the question; does evolutionary theory provide a &#8216;good&#8217; explanatory framework for examining the phenomenon of technological innovation? In doing so, the study critically examines mainstream marketing&#8217;s in-place explanatory frameworks, offers an explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; based on new insights from a broad range of (sub)disciplines, and makes the practical proposition that this explanation is a &#8216;good&#8217; analogous representation of the technological innovation process. As an alternative to the &#8216;scientific empiricist&#8217; approach that dominates much of marketing&#8217;s research into technological innovation, the study develops a research methodology that is based within a postmodern philosophy, adopts an epistemology of transcendental realism, bases the research design on abduction and textual explanation, and brings together a research method based on the criteria of interesting, plausibility and acceptability. Familiarisation with mainstream marketing&#8217;s explanatory frameworks for research into technological innovation identified Diffusion theory, New Product Development theory and Network theory as dominant. It is concluded that these frameworks are based on problematic theoretical foundations, a situation considered as largely due to a pre-occupation with assumptions that are atomistic, reductionistic, deterministic, gradualistic and mechanistic in nature. It is argued, that in concert with the &#8216;socialised&#8217; dominance of mathematical form over conceptual substance, mainstream marketing&#8217;s research into technological innovation is locked into a narrow range of &#8216;preordained axiomatics&#8217;. The explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; offered within the study is based on a why, what, how, when and where format. The resultant explanation represents a significant departure from the (neo)Darwinian biological perspective that tends to dominate evolutionary explanations of socio-economic behaviour, in that the focus is on the principles (and associated conceptualizations) of &#8216;variation&#8217;, &#8216;selection&#8217; and &#8216;preservation&#8217; within the broader context of open and dissipative systems. The offered explanation presents a number of theoretical ideas, and in particular, that evolution can only occur in a &#8216;multidimensional space of possibilities&#8217;, denotes a process of &#8216;adaptive emergence&#8217;, and is essentially concerned with &#8216;on-going resilience through adaptability&#8217;. The practical proposition is made that the offered explanation of &#8216;evolution&#8217; can be used in an &#8216;as if&#8217; manner, that is, the principles of &#8216;variation&#8217;, &#8216;selection&#8217;, and &#8216;preservation&#8217; (and the meanings ascribed to them through conceptualization) are analogically transferable to the technological innovation research area. The proposition is supported through reference to theoretical and empirical research, highlighting the similarity with respect to the generative mechanisms, structures and contingent conditions underpinning both &#8216;evolution&#8217; and &#8216;technological innovation&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="subject">Management Sciences and Quantitative Methods</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/10</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the project management body of knowledge and practice for urban renewal project implementation in Hong Kong special administrative region, China</field><field name="creator">Mui, Dennis Heung-Fu</field><field name="description">The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is faced with the rapid rate of urban deterioration. With the unique and densely populated nature of the city, the road to urban revitalisation can be envisaged to be a long and painful one. The government is determined to expedite the urban renewal work by establishing of the Urban Renewal Authority in May 2001 to replace Land Development Corporation that was established in 1988 to tackle the issue. The new set up is to operate with more public accountability and transparency as demanded by the community at large. It is also commissioned with the task of completing 225 projects in the next 25 years involving an estimated cost of over A$75 billion. The government has also decided to make Hong Kong Special Administrative Region a truly sustainable city by incorporating both urban sustainability and quality in urban renewal. Thus, a re-thinking of the project management application to enhance urban renewal project implementation is necessary and is beneficial in terms of finance, public confidence and maintenance of the  sustainable competitive advantage of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. This research is therefore justified. The research question formulated is:How can the project management body of knowledge and practice be applied to enable effective and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects in Hong Kong SAR?.Investigation of the extant literature in chapter 2 identified gaps in the body of knowledge and practice of applying professional project management principles and practices to urban renewal projects. A project management application model was formulated with five research issues that need to be resolved before the research question could be answered. These five research issues covered:&#8226; project organisational structure&#8226; team structure&#8226; attributes of team members&#8226; stakeholder management&#8226; communication and information technology enablersThe five research issues considered were:&#8226; Research Issue 1: What are the effects of projectised type organisational structure with integrated and multidisciplinary teams, corporate communication team, social services teams and informal project management community for each targeted district on urban renewal projects implementation?&#8226; Research Issue 2: What are the effects of a headquarters organisational structure with formal project management community, project auditing team, project support group and functional specialist advisory group on supporting the projectised organisational structure for each targeted district?&#8226; Research Issue 3: What are the effects of a flattened hierarchical structure with team members possessing sustainability knowledge and project managerial leaders being generalising specialists on the project team performance?&#8226; Research Issue 4: What are the effects of involving stakeholders at the outset of and throughout the projects with partnering relationship and formation of district advisory committee/community on urban renewal project implementation? &#8226; Research Issue 5: What are the effects of adopting information technology enablers by establishing computerised project  management information system interlinked to Web site accessible to the public on communication to stakeholders?The case study research methodology was adopted to answer each of the research issues. In depth studies of Urban Renewal Authority with functional departments as embedded subunits were designed. Less in-depth case studies were also conducted for overseas cases in developed countries like Australia, United State of America, United Kingdom, Singapore, Denmark, Austria, Ireland and Spain for cross-case analysis. A total of 13 personal interviews with different levels of staff were conducted for seven embedded sub-units in the Urban Renewal Authority case. Information was obtained from ten overseas cases from their Web site and also via e-mail correspondence with the appropriate staff in the organisations.The data obtained were then analysed to show the patterns of the results for each of the five research issues developed in the literature review and also for the new findings that were not planned from the literature review. The findings were then compared with the extant literature to identify the contributions that this research makes to understanding how the project management body of knowledge and practice can be applied to enable effective and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The application model for effective and efficient implementation of urban renewal projects modified to take into account the resolution of the research issues and the new findings is subsequently concluded.This research has contributed to both the knowledge of project management and urban renewal. The project management body of knowledge may need to put more emphasis on aspects of sustainability, multi-disciplinary and integrated approach, team hierarchical structure, team member attributes, stakeholder involvement and information technology enablers. Government support in both policy and implementation levels are of paramount importance in urban renewal work and needs more attention and focus. This research also provides some suggestions on the practice and policy especially on change management for introducing the application model in the existing organisation and the need of new legislation to supplement the existing one, on which the operation of Urban Renewal Authority is based.Finally, suggestions for further research are presented. These include quantitative research to test the application model built,  generalisation of the research to other places with different operating environments for both governmental and non-governmental organisations, strategy for urban renewal, attributes of top management for managing urban renewal organisation, and cultural risk in managing urban renewal projects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable urban renewal</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">stakeholder management</field><field name="subject">partnering</field><field name="subject">public participation</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/31</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproduction and recruitment of scleractinian corals on equatorial reefs in Mombasa, Kenya</field><field name="creator">Mangubhai, Sangeeta</field><field name="description">This study examined patterns of coral reproduction and recruitment on lagoonal reefs adjacent to Mombasa in Kenya, at latitude 4&#186;S. Very little detailed research has been done on the reproductive patterns of scleractinian corals on equatorial reefs, where it has been suggested that seasonality and spawning synchrony may break down due to the weak environmental cues that are thought to govern the onset and timing of reproduction. Gametogenic data were collected for three faviid (Echinopora gemmacea, Platygyra daedalea and Leptoria phrygia) and three Acropora species (A. tenuis, A. valida and Acropora sp.1) in the Mombasa Marine National Park and Reserve between April 2003 &#8211; May 2005. A further 20 species of Acropora were identified (9 species represented range extensions) and marked to examine intra- and inter-specific spawning synchrony within this genus. In comparison to other regions, the overall pattern of coral reproduction in Kenya was found to be asynchronous, with spawning occurring over 9 months of the year from August &#8211; April, with some level of &#8216;temporal reproductive isolation&#8217; occurring between species in relation to the main lunar month and lunar quarter when spawning occurred. Proximate cues governing the timing of reproduction could not be clearly discerned in Kenya with spawning occurring during both rising and maximum temperatures, during both neap and spring tides and across all lunar phases. Acropora species spawned over a 7-month period between October &#8211; April and faviid species over a 5-month period from December - April. The timing of reproduction in Acropora varied both within and among species, with the main release of gametes occurring from January &#8211; March when sea surface temperatures were at their summer maximum. Individual species released gametes over 2-5 months. The greatest overlap in spawning Acropora species occurred in February, which coincided with the spawning months of P. daedalea and E. gemmacea and suggests that some degree of multispecific spawning is a characteristic of Kenyan reefs. Within the main spawning period individual Acropora species had their main spawning in different lunar months. Acropora species released gametes in all lunar quarters, with the highest number of colonies and species spawning in the 3rd lunar quarter (i.e. in the 7 nights after full moon). Spawning in the faviids was more synchronised than Acropora species with the majority of faviid corals spawning in the 3rd lunar quarter. Single annual cycles of gametogenesis were recorded in E. gemmacea, A. tenuis, L.phrygia, most colonies of A. valida and Acropora sp.1, and in 84% of P. daedalea colonies. Biannual cycles of gametogenesis were recorded in 16% of P.daedalea colonies, which included two morphotypes identified in the Mombasa lagoon through morphometric and genetic studies. The presence of different oocyte sizes in L.phrygia during gametogenesis suggested that in some colonies there were two slightly overlapping oogenic cycles, which terminated in spawning within 1-2 months of each other. Overlapping oogenic cycles have not previously been recorded in hermaphroditic broadcast spawning corals in the tropics. The findings from Kenya support the hypothesis of protracted breeding seasons and a breakdown of spawning synchrony nearer the equator. It is hypothesised that the high fecundities recorded in faviid and Acropora species in Kenya compared to other regions, may allow reef corals to stagger their reproduction over 2-5 months, without incurring a significant reduction in fertilisation rates. Spat from the Family Pocilloporidae dominated settlement tiles in the Marine National Park and Reserve comprising 93.7% of spat, which contrasts with other tropical reefs where Acroporidae spat dominate. Patterns of settlement of Acroporidae spat generally coincided with the timing and extended spawning season in Acropora species in Kenya. The density and relative composition of coral recruits and juvenile corals on natural substrata recorded during this study were similar to those recorded before the 1997-98 bleaching event. There is no evidence to suggest that Kenya&#8217;s reefs have undergone a phase-shift in community structure, and reef recovery is occurring post-bleaching with mean percent hard coral cover currently at 25%. The slow rate of recovery of Kenya&#8217;s reefs is likely to reflect the scale of the mortality, source and availability of coral larvae as well as post-settlement processes operating at individual sites. In the medium-term, the recovery of Kenya&#8217;s reefs appears to be more strongly dependent on larvae from local reefs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coral</field><field name="subject">coral reproduction</field><field name="subject">coral spawning</field><field name="subject">equatorial reefs</field><field name="subject">Western Indian Ocean</field><field name="subject">gametogenesis</field><field name="subject">Terrestrial and Aquatic Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/1</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision making: being a study to develop a decision-making style to amalgamate best management practice with traditional Thai society and culture</field><field name="creator">Kittisarn, Akkapong</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the development of the decision-making style at Thailand&#8217;s Siam City Cement Public Company Limited (SCCC). The research reviewed the literature, including parent and immediate disciplines. The parent discipline was divided into disciplines 1, 2 and 3. Discipline 1 covered the concept of decision-making and its process. It also assessed types of decisions and summarised the model of decision-making. Discipline 2 looked at organisational structure, decision-making and the locus of decision-making. Finally, discipline 3 focused on group decision-making, group consideration in decision-making and enhancing the group decision-making process. In the immediate discipline, the key elements that influence Thai&#8217;s decision-making styles were discussed. This encompassed Thai societal and cultural characteristics, Hierarchy, organisational characteristics and decision-making. Moreover, research gaps were also explored and the study then proposed four research propositions. The propositions included directing SCCC to develop an appropriate decision-making style based on the group decision-making strategy. The analysis undertaken was qualitative and employed a case study methodology. The data was collected in SCCC&#8217;s Bangkok office between May and September 2002. Data collection was carried out using the Triangulation method. This method employs multiple sources of evidence, including personal interviews, direct and participant observations, documentation and obtaining archival records. The findings confirmed that group decisionmaking should be adopted to enhance the effectiveness of decision-making and efficiency within the firm. Recommendations were also provided for improving practices at the individual, department and organisational level.

The distinguishing feature of a cooperative education partnership is that all partners contribute to the development, design and delivery of academic courses in the workplace.This research assesses the role and key aspects of professionalism developed by professional development education for industry employees. More specifically, the investigation examined the conditions that contribute to building mutually beneficial, reciprocal cooperative education partnerships between a university and its tourism and hospitality partners.A qualitative approach was adopted to analyse and to understand five cooperative education partnerships situated within the School of Tourism and Hospitality Management Southern Cross University, Lismore, Australia. The investigation used the &#8216;Tit-for-Tat&#8217; strategy (Axelrod, 1984; Ridley, 1996; Davies, 1999) based on the old French game of &#8216;Prisoners Dilemma&#8217; (Campbell, 1983; Trivers, 1983) to examine reciprocity.The investigation revealed that providing university-level professional development education through cooperative education partnerships contributed to the development and enhancement of professionalism in the tourism and hospitality organisations involved in the study. Two aspects of professionalism, a renewal of learning, and establishing a positive professional reputation, were found to be important for advancing professionalism in this education arena.A further finding was that when a university, tourism and hospitality businesses and industry associations join together in cooperative education partnerships, they generally respond and adapt to each other in reciprocal ways to ensure the sustainability and success of their partnership. Adjustment, adaptation, responsiveness and synergy were found to be important reciprocal concepts that underpin cooperative dynamics in this investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">universities</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">Higher Education Administration</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/51</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of instruction in two-digit addition and subtraction using a classroom teaching experiment methodology, design research, and multilevel modeling</field><field name="creator">Tabor, Pamela D</field><field name="description">In his keynote address to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics research pre-session, Sloane (2006b) challenged mathematics education researchers to &#8216;quantify qualitative insights&#8217;. This quasi-experimental study used blended methods to investigate the development of two-digit addition and subtraction strategies. Concurrent classroom teaching experiments were conducted in two intact first grade classrooms (n = 41) in a mid-Atlantic American public school. From a pragmatic emergent perspective, design research (Gravemeijer &amp; Cobb, 2006) was used to develop local instructional theory. An amplified theoretical framework for early base-ten strategies is explicated. Multilevel modelling for repeated measures was used to evaluate the differences in strategy usage between classes across occasions and the association of particular pedagogical practices with the emergence of incrementing and decrementing by ten (N10) or decomposition (1010) strategies (Beishuizen, Felix, &amp; Beishuizen, 1990).The two matched classes were not different in terms of gender, poverty, race, pre-assessment performance, and special education services. After the first unit of instruction with differentiated pedagogical tools, the collection class was significantly (p = .001) more likely to use 1010 than the linear class. No difference was demonstrated during the post-assessment. Students in both classes were more likely to use N10 during the last structured interview than in the first (p &lt; .0001). Furthermore, there was no difference between the two classes in using any advanced strategy; however, students in both classes were more likely to use an advanced strategy at the conclusion of the study than they were initially (p = .033). The order of emergence of 1010 and N10 was not associated with the ability to develop both strategies, but there was an association (p &lt; .001) between use of an advanced strategy and success on a district-mandated written assessment of two-digit addition and subtraction.Two original instructional sequences of contextually-based investigations are presented. Protocols transcribed from videotaped lessons and dynamic assessment interviews are presented to illuminate specific constructs detected and to illustrate the pedagogical techniques. An amplified framework for early place value constructs is proposed. Recommendations for future studies, curricular changes, and the need of early intervention are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">primary education</field><field name="subject">mathematics education</field><field name="subject">numeracy</field><field name="subject">two-digit addition and subtraction</field><field name="subject">teaching experiment</field><field name="subject">multilevel modelling</field><field name="subject">design research</field><field name="subject">video transcripts</field><field name="subject">dynamic assessment</field><field name="subject">clinical interviews</field><field name="subject">number sense and operation</field><field name="subject">blended methods</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/68</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public sector reform agendas and outcomes for trade unions: the case of local government reform in Victoria, 1992-1999</field><field name="creator">Connoley, Robert</field><field name="description">From the early 1980s, Western governments, led mainly by those in the United Kingdom, have pursued public choice ideas in managing their public sectors, often targeting the monopoly position of public sectors in delivering public goods and services and also the influence and position of public sector trade unions. This policy approach also underpinned the reforms to local government in Victoria, Australia that occurred between 1992 and 1999. The Victorian State Government pursued an agenda of reform aimed at reducing costs in local government, reducing the size and scope of local government in delivering public goods and services and also seeking to reduce the perceived high level of influence of trade unions. On the basis of a literature review of the experiences of public sector reform in the United Kingdom during the 1980s, this study sought to test two propositions about public sector reform agendas and trade unions, using the Victorian local government reform as the primary research context. This was an important research gap since trade unions were a major target of the reform agenda and little research information existed as to how the reform agenda impacted on local government trade unions. Although the Victorian State Government did not possess direct legislative power over trade union behaviour, a reform agenda similar to that imposed by the governments in the United Kingdom, could inflict negative outcomes through the consequential changes resulting from competition in the delivery of local council services. The first proposition was that public sector reform agendas underpinned by public choice ideas sought to inculcate competitive practices in the provision of local government services and consequently reduce trade union influence and position in local government. The second proposition was that the level of success achieved by governments on these dual objectives was determined in part by the responses taken by trade unions to the reform agenda and on the extent to which local councils adopted a competitive culture.Five major research questions and a number of sub-questions were developed from the literature to test these two research propositions. In addition, models of effects on trade unions arising from public sector reform and on trade union responses were developed. The models were important for visually showing the areas of impact on trade unions and the level of impact caused by the reform and to identify the options available and responses undertaken by trade unions during this period. An analytical framework was also established and served as a template for organising and recording findings in this study. The analytical framework served to show the main causal links between the reform agenda and outcomes for trade unions. The study adopted features of both positivist and interpretive methodological approaches to address these research questions. A positivist approach was applied in the development of research protocols to ensure researcher independence. In addition, the information collected was matched to the models of union behaviour and to the relevant elements in the analytical framework. The study also adopted features of an interpretive approach in respect of using small samples and in gathering data through interviews with key informants from three case study organisations, one trade union and two local councils.The information collected on the research questions enabled conclusions to be reached on the two research propositions. The findings supported the first proposition and confirmed previous research studies in the United Kingdom that showed how governments are able to target trade unions in indirect ways through the consequences of the promotion of competition in the delivery of local government goods and services. The study identified the negative effects arising for Victorian local government trade unions in areas of access and influence on government policy decision making, membership levels, bargaining outcomes and relations within and between trade unions. The findings gathered in this study also supported the second research proposition. The level of success by the Victorian State Government in achieving local government reform objectives was in part limited by the responses taken by trade unions and also by the extent to which local councils adopted competitive practices. These findings have contributed important insights into local government reform and trade unions, which had not previously been addressed by researchers. The study has also contributed models of union behaviour and an analytical framework for addressing contemporary public policy issues and trade unions. The amalgamation of local councils planned by the Queensland State Government provides a similar research context in which to further test the usefulness of the models of union behaviour and the analytical framework. In addition, the return of the Australian Labor Party to Federal Government, and their aim of dismantling the previous Liberal-National Party&#8217;s WorkChoices industrial relations legislation, provides a context for testing these models and framework under conditions where more direct legislative changes affecting union rights to organise and bargain are pursued.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">Victorian local government</field><field name="subject">trade unions</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/69</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forces shaping the trends and patterns of China&#8217;s outbound international tourist flows</field><field name="creator">Tse, Sze Ming</field><field name="description">This study concerns itself with outbound tourist flows from China. It is informed by the interpretive social sciences paradigm, and the research methodology is qualitative and inductive in nature. The study uses secondary data analysis, case study, interview/questionnaire and participant observation to answer the research question &#8220;How are the trends and patterns of China&#8217;s outbound international tourist flows being shaped?&#8221;Secondary-data analysis is used to understand the historical, socio-economic and political context in which China&#8217;s outbound tourism has developed. Case study is used to identify the similarities and differences in policy and international tourist flow patterns in Japan, Taiwan and Korea, and provide a benchmark for studying China&#8217;s outbound tourism.A total of 13 academics and industry practitioners and 22 senior China National Tourism Administration officials were interviewed either in person or via questionnaire, to examine the roles played by the Chinese government in outbound tourism. Information about China&#8217;s outbound tourism and macro environment was collected from six different forums and seminars.Seven different forces in the macro-environment were found to be at play in China&#8217;s outbound tourism, namely competitive, demographic, economic, technological, cultural, natural and political. The study develops the theory that it is the interplay of these forces that shapes the development of outbound tourism. Among the seven forces, political force, or state control, is the strongest at the moment. The thesis has it that the dialectic interaction between the market economy and state control determines the socio-economic framework shaping the trends and patterns of outbound international tourist flows in China.The Chinese government is not ambiguous about the fact that it has a role to play in outbound tourism. That role is not just related to quality of living, a level playing field or economic development, but also national dignity, diplomacy, and international relations. To the Chinese government, stability is of such paramount importance that the country&#8217;s collective interests are emphasised over the interests of the individual, which are associated with social instability and disorder. Therefore, outbound travel by individuals will be allowed to flourish as long as it continues to serve the wider national interest of the country and it does not undermine national stability.How can these findings be of use to destinations? When approaching China as a potential source market, destinations need to take a more holistic approach in order to understand the underlying drivers of its outbound tourism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/82</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasound imaging of finger tendons at the bedside in the emergency department: a pilot study to assess whether it is a feasible and useful investigation</field><field name="creator">Hall, Ann Charlotte</field><field name="description">The interplay of structures in the finger that facilitate movement is complex and not yet fully understood. Subtle finger injuries are often missed during the initial assessment in the Emergency Department, because clinical examination of the acutely injured hand can be difficult. The consequences of unrecognized finger injuries can be devastating for the patient. Ultrasound imaging of tendons is a useful investigative tool although little has been published regarding the reliability of finger tendon measurements. The overall objective of this project was to establish if bedside ultrasound imaging of tendons was possible and useful in the setting of acute injury. The project was divided into two studies.In the first study, 65 apparently normal volunteers were scanned to allow the principal investigator to practise and refine the ultrasound technique. The dimensions of the Extensor Digitorum Longus and two flexor tendons combined (Flexor Digitorum Profundus and Flexor Digitorum Superficialis) were measured in both transverse and longitudinal sections. Fifteen of the volunteers had their left middle fingers scanned twice within 48 hours to establish the test to retest reliability of tendon measurement. The established scanning technique was simple to perform and the scans, including both static and real time images, were completed within five minutes. All volunteers were able to tolerate a full scan. Measurement of tendon width showed fair to good reliability (Intra class correlation [ICC] of flexor tendons = 0.66, ICC of extensor tendon = 0.54). However measurement of the depth of all the tendons was unreliable test to retest (ICC &lt; 0.37).In the second study, 30 patients who presented to the Emergency Department at Lismore Base Hospital with hand injuries were scanned for evidence of tendon injury and tendon gliding restriction. The patient&#8217;s ability to tolerate ultrasound examination was investigated. The scan findings were compared with the clinical findings and then to the operation report or to the patient&#8217;s self reported outcome, one month after injury.Patients were willing to undergo ultrasound examination regardless of the extent of their injury. There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) in scan tolerance related to the site of injury with 50% of those with extensor surface injuries having completed scans in comparison to 36% with flexor surface injuries and 9.1% of finger tip injuries. Injury mechanism was not related to scan tolerance.Excluding a partial tendon laceration was technically difficult due to the presence of anisotropy artefact. However, all complete tendon lacerations were successfully identified prior to surgery. The gliding of the tendons was easy to visualize and abnormal gliding was found to be a marker of tendon injury.The overall results show that ultrasound imaging of finger tendons at the bedside in the Emergency Department is a feasible examination to perform. The addition of ultrasound examination, however, did not identify any cases of tendon injury not already suspected on routine clinical examination.Therefore, this pilot study suggests that routine use of ultrasound examination to detect finger tendon injury in the Emergency Department setting will not prove to be a useful investigation. There may be a role for ultrasound as a screening tool as the gliding of normal tendons differed noticeably from the gliding of injured tendons. The presence of normal tendon gliding may be helpful in identifying those patients that are safe to be discharged from the Emergency Department without further evaluation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrasound</field><field name="subject">finger</field><field name="subject">tendon</field><field name="subject">emergency</field><field name="subject">injury</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Radiology</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/88</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Children Activity Scanning Tool (CAST): a methodological study of an instrument to measure physical activity engagement levels of children in school playgrounds and similar environments: a study of the instrument&#8217;s development through four health promotion projects in NSW Australia</field><field name="creator">Zask, Avigdor</field><field name="description">Thesis aim: This thesis aims to analyse and critically evaluate the Children Activity Scanning Tool (CAST), which measures children&#8217;s physical activity (PA) engagement levels in school playgrounds and similar environments, focusing on CAST reliability and validity using data from four health promotion projects in the Northern Rivers (Move it Groove it (MIGI) project), Illawarra, Central Coast and Dubbo areas in NSW, Australia.The overall research question is whether physical activity engagement levels of large numbers of children can be validly and reliably measured in school playgrounds and similar environments using CAST.Methodology: CAST was used to scan school playgrounds and similar environments, in which unstructured rest, play and other physical activities take place. Scanning was undertaken by a team of trained observers who concurrently scanned a pre-defined area of the playground and recorded the number of children engaged in assigned physical activity intensity categories.Criterion validity was measured in three projects comparing the total number of children counted in separate physical activity categories to an independent count of the number of children in the playground using Pearson correlation coefficients. Data obtained during instrument development were used to determine criterion validity in two projects when compared to videotapes using Pearson correlation, Cronbach alphas and 95% CI around mean engagement levels.Data obtained during development and training, as well as project field data were used for reliability testing. Cronbach alpha, Pearson correlation, factor analysis and 95% CI around mean engagement levels were used to measure inter-rater reliability.Data from multi-level regression models obtained in three projects were used to calculate intra class correlation (ICC) and composite reliabilities of scan and break level physical activity engagement.Results: Criterion validity measures comparing sums of categories counts to independent counts of all children yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.97, 0.81 and 0.96 in the Illawarra, Central Coast and Dubbo projects respectively. Criterion validity measures comparing field and video scores yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.47, 0.52 and 0.56 respectively in the Move it Groove it (MIGI) project, and in the Illawarra study Cronbach alphas of 0.98 and 0.85, and a Pearson correlation of 0.93. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of children who were engaged in a physical activity level when 95% CI were used except for one category in the MIGI study.Inter-rater reliability estimates in all projects were high or very high. There were no significant differences between the mean numbers of children engaged in a physical activity level when 95% CI were used. Almost 86% (12/14) of the standardised Cronbach alpha estimates were equal to or greater than 0.93. Principal component analysis values ranged from 76%-98%. ICCs obtained from field data yielded composite reliabilities of 0.77-0.94.Conclusion: It was concluded that CAST was a valid and reliable instrument to measure physical activity engagement levels of children in school playgrounds.Recommendations: The two or three categories versions CAST should be used as they produced the highest quality data when used to observe large groups in well-defined playgrounds. Further research is needed to validate other variables (eg equipment), validate a one observer CAST version, and test the feasibility of using children as observers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">school playgrounds</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">health promotion</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">validity</field><field name="subject">reliability</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/100</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenge, tension and possibility: an exploration into contemporary western herbal medicine in Australia</field><field name="creator">Evans, Sue</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the contemporary challenges facing herbal medicine. Specifically it concerns the difficulties faced by Australian herbalists in their attempts to maintain authority over the knowledge base of their craft and a connection with traditional understandings of the uses of plant medicines, while at the same time engaging with biomedicine and the broader Australian healthcare system. It contributes to the study of the nascent field of qualitative studies in contemporary western herbal medicine by making three main arguments.Firstly, Australian herbal medicine is characterised by its origins as a European colonial practice and its history of professional marginalisation during most of the 20th century. Secondly herbal practitioners have been unable to capitalise significantly on a surge of public popularity in the closing years of the 20th century which brought with it the interest of industry, the scrutiny of regulators and the renewed attention of biomedicine. Herbalists continue to struggle for recognition in the face of these more powerful interests. Thirdly it is argued that herbalists are attempting to gain legitimacy and acceptance as a healthcare profession through a process of underpinning their knowledge base with science, which is replacing their traditional philosophical basis. This has the effect of weakening the ability of herbalists to maintain their identity as an independent profession and makes its knowledge base vulnerable to appropriation by other healthcare professions.Gross&#8217; model of the cultural location of traditions in contemporary societies is used to clarify the situation of herbalists and to identify problems consequent to the political choices they have made or which have been forced upon them. Gross suggests that traditions which place themselves close to power have difficulty in maintaining their own character and integrity, but that other cultural locations are also problematic and limit full participation in society. vi It is argued that there are compelling reasons to move beyond Gross&#8217; analysis and to find ways to strengthen the independence of the herbal profession. Given the financial problems facing the current healthcare system in Australia and the looming ecological challenges, radical changes to the current system are required. The central concepts of herbal practice, in particular vitalism and holism, lead to approaches to healthcare which are potentially both costeffective and ecologically sustainable. A robust and independent profession of western herbalists, with their philosophy articulated and restored, could provide a valuable and sustainable contribution to Australian healthcare.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herbal medicine</field><field name="subject">herbalists</field><field name="subject">tradition</field><field name="subject">margenalisation</field><field name="subject">professionalisation</field><field name="subject">phytotherapy</field><field name="subject">social epistemology</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/86</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small and medium business sponsorship of regional sport tourism events</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Increasingly, communities in regional areas are turning to sports events of a small scale to bring new money into their local economy, provide employment, and provide intangible benefits such as increased community pride. Sports events held on an irregular basis can attract visitors from outside a host community, thus resulting in an increase in business during slow periods and possibly promote the host region as a tourist destination after an event has been staged.In many instances, sponsorship has proven to be the financial lifeblood of sport tourism events held in regional areas, and often provides a majority of the revenue necessary to sustain the successful staging of such events. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) frequently provide the sponsorship necessary to stage such events, owing to the fact that large businesses are sparse in regional areas.The academic community has paid little attention to the sponsorship nexus between SMEs and regional sport tourism events, which this study aimed to address. Grounded in the interpretivist social sciences paradigm, this qualitative study examined five case studies through interviewing five SME owner/managers and five managers of regional sport tourism events. Areas examined included perceptions of sponsorship, reasons why SMEs provided sponsorship to regional sport tourism events, sponsorship leveraging, evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness, and how sponsorships were initiated between SMEs and regional sport tourism events.The results of this research found that the event managers and SME sponsors shared differing perceptions of what constitutes &#8216;sponsorship&#8217;. Volunteer event managers tended to view sponsorship in a somewhat philanthropic manner, while professional event managers were well aware of the importance of reciprocating a return on investment to their sponsors. Sponsorships in this context were initiated either through formal request or networks of personal contacts between SMEs and event organising committees. The sponsorships studied were found to be highly informal in nature and bound by gentlemen&#8217;s agreements, as opposed to legally binding contracts.The primary reasons driving SMEs to sponsor such events were related to supporting their local community and to be seen as socially responsible. Engaging in sponsorship to achieve bottom-line objectives were secondary to community involvement, which confirmed findings from similar studies conducted previously.The results also indicated that sponsorship leveraging and evaluation of sponsorship effectiveness did occur, albeit with varying degrees of success. Both sponsors and event managers tended to exhibit low levels of proficiency in being able to carry out effective sponsorship leveraging and evaluations, and as such leveraging and evaluation techniques employed in these sponsorships tended to be unsophisticated and inexpensive to execute. Only one of the five events studied provided any written post-event feedback to their sponsors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship</field><field name="subject">sport tourism</field><field name="subject">SME</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">events</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/85</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information system success: evaluation of a carbon accounting and sequestration system</field><field name="creator">Smart, William J</field><field name="description">The primary aim of the research conducted for this thesis was to develop a predictive model of information systems success for a publicly-available, web-based application that provides information to users on both the value of carbon credits that result from sequestration of carbon in a forest as well as potential earnings from supply of saleable timber. The application, also developed as part of this research, is called the CO2 Calculator. In addition attitudes of respondents to climate change and carbon sequestration were also gauged to ascertain their knowledge of key environmental issues relevant to the system.The model used as the foundation for the research is the DeLone and McLean (1992, 2002, 2003) model of information systems success. This model was adapted to measure information systems success for the CO2 Calculator which is a publicly available, web-based application rather than a proprietary, task-specific, organizationally focused application as measured in the prior research.Data was collected via a survey dispatched by email to users who accessed the CO2 Calculator. The survey instrument used builds on the existing work of Torkzadeh and Doll (1988, 1999), Seddon and Kiew (1994) and Torkzadeh et al. (2005). All of these researchers used variations of the End User Survey (EUS) to collect data on end users&#8217; perceptions of the success of various applications, all of which were internal, organisationally-focussed, task specific, proprietary systems. This meant the survey items used for the current research were adapted to measure users&#8217; attitudes to a publicly-available, web-based application that had no task-specific roles in an organisation.Analysis of the data proceeded in two distinct phases. The first phase was the examination and presentation of descriptive information about the demographic characteristics of the sample and the users&#8217; attitudes to climate change, carbon sequestration and the overall success of the CO2 Calculator. The descriptive data indicated the respondents are a  technologically literate group who have concerns related to environmental management and the use of land for sustainable practices. It also showed that the users were extremely satisfied with the CO2 Calculator.In the second phase Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was used to examine the constructs underlying the data and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to examine the relationships among the constructs. Both the EFA and SEM resulted in structures and relationships that differed from the hypothesised outcomes and revealed a set of constructs and relationships that were clearly associated with the success of a publicly-available, web based application with different theoretical associations than those found by previous researchers examining organisationally-focussed, proprietary applications.Regression analyses were also conducted to check the relationships among constructs that were omitted from the final structural model, but were on the hypothesised model. Support for their inclusion in further studies was found as the analysis identified that the scales used to measure these constructs were significant predictors of the outcome variables although not when networked with those constructs that were on the final measurement model.Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, it has resulted in the identification of a predictive model of information success for web-based, publicly available, nonorganisationally focused systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Natural Resource Economics</field><field name="subject">Natural Resources Management and Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/84</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of business ethical practices in Australian organisations: a multiple case study</field><field name="creator">Wong, Peter Wai-Hong</field><field name="description">In view of the latest corporate collapses globally, the purpose of this thesis is an attempt to investigate and to theorise how managers make decisions when faced with an ethical dilemma.Philosophers over the years have proposed different moral theories. For example, Kantian&#8217;s Categorical Imperative (O&#8217;Neil 2001, Peters, 1971) suggests that there are laws that should apply universally. However, its principles are too abstract to guide action, in that it does not provide a detailed set of instructions for following them. Others such as Baier, (2001) suggest that people behave to satisfy their own self-interest. The literature review shows that there is no consensus to define what constitutes ethical behaviour. Kohlberg (1981) divides childhood moral development into six stages. He theorises that greater moral development will be related to the highest social responsibility of an individual. Lagon (2000), Seabright and Moberg (1998), Logsdon and Yuthas (1997) extrapolate Kohlberg&#8217;s model to incorporate into organisational and individual moral development.Based on the literature review, research questions were developed. The research methodology is qualitative, based on the realism paradigm using a case research design (Yin 1994). Face to face interviews were conducted with fourteen participants using critical incidents and the findings were triangulated using a semi-structured focus group.The research data analysis is based on grounded theory proposed by Glaser and Strauss (1967). The findings confirm that there is no single theory or approach to business ethics. The findings indicate that a person&#8217;s ethical behaviour changes when his/her self-interest is affected. Whilst participants believed that business and ethics can be reconciled, most agreed that they can only be reconciled if the individual&#8217;s interest or business profit is not affected. Based on the findings, a new model is proposed in an attempt to theorise an   individual&#8217;s business ethical behaviour and his/her ethical decision making process.This research also identifies important areas that require further research. These are:&#8226; Conflicts between personal values and business values&#8226; Should ethics be taught?

The intent is to develop methods to manage this conflict and so enhance the delivery of regional development outcomes. The research problem explored is: &#8216;Government Department core business &#8211; managing the impact of potential conflicts on regional development projects and programs&#8217;The research involves three discipline areas &#8211; Government and governance, public sector management practices, and regional development. Government agency (GA) core business is determined by Government and delivered using public sector management practices that have shaped individual agency&#8217;s strategic plans, processes and systems for core business delivery. Regional development involves multiple agencies delivering their core business outcomes that contribute to regional development. Due to the focus by each agency on their own core business, core business conflict can occur when agencies work together.A literature review did not uncover literature or research about GA core business conflict, therefore this is a new area of investigation. The literature studies and reports investigated and discussed a related area &#8211; issues and impediment to Whole-of- Government (WOG) and &#8216;joined-up&#8217; government initiatives.A qualitative inquiry methodology is used to build knowledge about this new area. The sample of participants is drawn from GAs&#8217; staff who are involved in regional development projects and programs, or projects and programs that contribute to regional development. Data collection is through interviews and surveys with GAs&#8217; representatives from 18 agencies, across three levels of Government and from two distinctly different regions (coastal and inland).Two aspects of core business conflict are investigated &#8211; fundamental core business conflict that involves the underpinning philosophy and ideology of an agency, and functional/operational core business conflicts that include the strategic plans, policies, procedures and systems involved in delivery of core business, which also influence the design of program and project guidelines, and determine funding and staff resourcing.Research findings contribute new knowledge and expand current knowledge regarding challenges and barriers to agencies working together. Findings also enhance the application of approaches and tools to facilitate effective WOG and collaborative agency work.The research has resulted in a &#8216;process&#8217; model to resolve the research problem that applies a holistic and comprehensive operational approach to addressing core business conflict. The &#8216;process&#8217; model builds on the research findings and draws on information and tools from the literature.The research has implications for theory, policy and practice in the three discipline areas involved in the research problem and as a new area investigated, has generated further research opportunities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regional development</field><field name="subject">joined-up government</field><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">integrated government</field><field name="subject">Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/102</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing in the lion's den: women leaders in local government</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Roslyn</field><field name="description">During the twentieth century, women were elected into all spheres of government and political leadership positions in increasing numbers. Still, their numbers are substantially lower than their representation in the population. The same trend is evident in local government in many countries. With few exceptions, there are now more women numerically and proportionately in local government than in state or national governments. Nevertheless, the limited research on women representatives in local government demonstrates that the environment of local government is not necessarily comfortable for women. Many more women than men leave local government voluntarily. If women who are currently practising politics inside local government leave in substantial numbers then little will change. This means that women entering it in the future will face the same environments and challenges (Freeman &amp; Bourque 2001).Against this background, the research study seeks to provide an explanation of how different women experience and perceive positions traditionally held by men, whether there are shared understandings and experiences that transcend the women&#8217;s differences and whether they are changing the environment of local government. To investigate these questions, I employ qualitative feminist research within a framework of feminist political theory, drawing broadly on a range of feminist theory and a variety of political emphases. I interview forty-nine women leaders in local government from England, Sweden, India, the Philippines and Australia, investigating their perspectives and practice thus weighing theory with practice.Several theoretical and practical themes emerge from these findings. The practice revealed by the interviewees is complex, ambiguous and nuanced, consistent with the feminist valuation of relationship, context and the particular. The interviewees bring a different social perspective, reflecting their situated experiences, to their work. This transforms the masculinist environment of the lion&#8217;s den in significant, albeit subtle, ways. The practice of the interviewees shapes agendas and decision-making processes, changes the way representatives of both genders feel about those processes, and molds outcomes for their communities in subtle but distinct ways. In addition, many of the interviewees use their agency actively to change the practices and environment of their councils.I conclude that the practice revealed by these interviewees is best described as a dance in a complex and alien environment, within which women make a palpable difference. This supports arguments for increasing women at the leadership level in both the administrative and political areas of local government, supported by a critical mass of women councillors. More than that, it testifies to the urgency of that task if local government &#8211; the lion&#8217;s den &#8211; is to be more representative of the diverse people it purports to represent.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">politics</field><field name="subject">government</field><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">representation</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">difference</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="subject">Political Science</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/97</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comfort in adventure: the role of comfort, constraints and negotiation in recreational SCUBA diving</field><field name="creator">Dimmock, Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the role of comfort in adventure leisure and in recreational SCUBA diving in particular. In this chapter the study&#8217;s central elements of comfort, constraints and negotiation will be introduced. Human engagement with marine locations provides background to the evolution of SCUBA diving as a leisure activity. The concept of comfort is then introduced, with attention given to what comfort means from a range of disciplines. Following this, the use of the term comfort in adventure, leisure and tourism research is reviewed. Divers&#8217; constraints to comfort are also briefly examined here in this introduction, to build understanding of how comfort can be experienced during adventure, and SCUBA diving. Leisure constraints-negotiation research is discussed briefly and linked to SCUBA diving experiences. The objectives of this study are then presented prior to introducing the qualitative research paradigm that guides the research, and the thesis outline.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SCUBA diving</field><field name="subject">constraints</field><field name="subject">leisure negotiation</field><field name="subject">marine</field><field name="subject">dive tourism</field><field name="subject">leisure experiences</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/96</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independent bicycle tourism in Australia: a whole tourism systems analysis</field><field name="creator">Lamont, Matthew James</field><field name="description">Evidence exists to suggest increasing political interest in cycling-related tourism, particularly as a contributor to economic and social development in rural communities. The former Australian Government&#8217;s long-term strategy document for tourism, the Tourism White Paper, has also identified cycling-related tourism as a potential contributor to strengthening competitive advantage for Australia with respect to tourism. However, little theory-driven research exists hitherto to guide decision-making regarding prudent provision of infrastructure and services to facilitate the development of cycling-related tourism, while little research exists that aids in our understanding of the travel behaviours and characteristics of bicycle tourists.The present study examined independent bicycle tourists in Australia using a generic model of whole tourism systems as a framework for analysis. The study employed a mixture of quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore the needs, preferences and behaviours of independent bicycle tourists. In addition, several conditions previously identified in applied literature as possible impediments to the development of independent bicycle tourism in Australia were examined.The results indicated that independent bicycle tourists&#8217; behaviours and thought processes regarding destination selection reflected those put forward in the broader literature addressing special interest tourism, in that the activity to be pursued is more prevalent in driving decision-making than the actual destination(s) to be visited. This was illustrated by the importance attached by the respondents to aspects that directly relate to a destination area&#8217;s capacity to support cycling, particularly the presence and quality of cycling infrastructure (specifically roads, paths, trails and signage), endowed resources (appealing natural scenery), supporting industries, and accessibility.Three conditions were confirmed as impediments to the development of independent bicycle tourism in Australia. These impediments included perceptions of cycling on Australian roads as a dangerous practice; perceptions that infrastructure to support independent bicycle touring in Australia is generally inadequate; and perceived difficulties associated with the carriage of bicycles on air, coach and rail services in Australia. This research also identified several limitations regarding the capacity of Leiper&#8217;s model of whole tourism systems to articulate tourist flows associated with independent bicycle tourism. These limitations specifically related to the way the tourist destination regions and transit routes elements are conceptually defined in the generic model. An adapted descriptive, theoretical model of whole tourism systems involving independent bicycle tourism was proposed. The adapted model incorporated a geographic &#8216;hierarchy of destinations&#8217; sub-system and also acknowledged two distinct forms of transit routes: those traversed between the traveller-generating region and the destination area; and those traversed within the destination area by bicycle.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bicycle tourism</field><field name="subject">cycle tourism</field><field name="subject">whole tourism systems</field><field name="subject">cycling</field><field name="subject">special interest tourism</field><field name="subject">adventure tourism</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/95</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of participants at special interest events in regional Australia</field><field name="creator">Mackellar, Joanne</field><field name="description">Events provide opportunities for communities to socialise, interact and to enjoy a sense of mutual celebration. However, special interest events offer other opportunities for recreation, and for the development of skills, identities and knowledge. Events such as car shows, Sci-fi conventions and Elvis festivals have large numbers of participants, as well as spectators, who have specialised needs and characteristics. This thesis uses a series of five published studies to examine the participants at special interest events and further to understand their characteristics and behaviours. The studies employ a mixed method approach to explore participants at a total of eleven events in Australia. In the first of these studies a spectrum of events is developed to explain the diversity of events in a region, as related to the special interest of participants. The study used a mixed method methodology to examine the differences between audiences at nine events in the Tweed Valley of NSW. The results were used to focus the study more on events that target serious participants.The second study was published as a conceptual paper, providing a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of serious participants of leisure, recreation and events. The paper posits a model of serious participants (SerPa) for use and refinement in subsequent studies. Papers 3 and 4 explore serious participants at two feature events in Australia, the Wintersun Festival in Coolangatta, and the Elvis Revival Festival in Parkes. Drawing on the serious leisure framework proposed by Stebbins (2001), and other leisure and tourism research, the study explored the characteristics and behaviours of serious participants at these events. Ethnographic methods were used to gain insight into behaviours, through participant observation at the events. The findings further develop the SerPa model, but also identify other themes that are relevant to leisure and event management and marketing. Paper 5 explores the social connections of serious participants made on the Internet, and identifies their relationship to travel planning and events. The study utilised ethnographic methods adapted to the Internet, to identify and discuss the social characteristics of serious participants as fans of Lord of the Rings, and the processes used to collaborate toward travel planning.The study demonstrates the significance of serious participants as a segment of audiences at events, highlighting their contributions to the events themselves. As participants, they make the event happen, and are perhaps more important than consumers (Getz, 2007). They are defined by what they do in their leisure time, more than who they were born as, or by their profession. They have a leisure identity that defines them, and can find support and security in the fanatical system that they subscribe to. This system is usually found in special interest clubs, on-line networks and at events. These social systems help sustain their beliefs, and provide a leisure world where they feel a sense of &#8216;we&#8217;. From their serious devotion and social connectivity, serious participants receive social and personal rewards, which in turn provide more stimuli to develop their skills and/or knowledge. These psycho/social characteristics result in participants searching for new challenges and new destinations, which can facilitate their needs. These are found at events that are designed specifically with serious participants in mind. The study demonstrates that identification of these market segments has important implications for the design and sustainability of events in Australia, and overseas. Additionally, it also has implications for planners and practitioners in leisure and tourism in understanding the extant links between recreation, travel and events.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">event</field><field name="subject">participant</field><field name="subject">special interest</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">festival</field><field name="subject">Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/94</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional festivals: nourishing community resilience: the nature and role of cultural festivals in Northern Rivers NSW communities</field><field name="creator">Derrett, Ros</field><field name="description">This thesis examines four regional community cultural festivals in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia. It reveals the complex interplay of a sense of place and community, a destination&#8217;s identity and representation, host guest relationships and the underlying nature and role of celebration expressed in each festival. It examines the regional context in which the Jacaranda Festival in Grafton, the Beef Week celebrations in Casino, the New Year&#8217;s Eve celebrations in Byron Bay and the Mardi Grass Law reform rally in Nimbin are conducted. An extensive literature review provides a global perspective on theories, issues and trends in the sectors reflected in the case study festivals. The phenomenological approach to the case study methodology is explained before each festival is closely scrutinized, addressing the study&#8217;s aim.The thesis aims at a better understanding of the elements of resilience fostered by festivals when communities take intentional action. This resilience dimension emerged as a major outcome of the initial investigation of the nature and role of festivals in regional communities.The thesis argues that festivals allow people to reflect and determine a sense of community and place, represent their image and identity and contribute to cultural tourism. Community festivals involve the local population in a shared experience to their mutual benefit by providing both social functions and symbolic meanings. This study contends that community-based festivals celebrate the community&#8217;s social identity, its historical continuity and its cultural resilience. They are socially constructed and negotiated phenomena and can be staged in everyday places that also become tourist places. Festivals provide a forum for creativity, custom, heritage and cultural practices for both resident and guest.Investigating community cultural festivals from multiple perspectives allows for greater understanding of the nuances of the relationships between stakeholders. By identifying the patterns, structures and meanings of the contexts that festivals represent we are better informed of the distinctive values, interests and aspirations held by residents when they host festivals. Perspectives on community festivals and resilience were canvassed from diverse perspectives as demonstrated by the following typical responses:Nourishing resilience through Festivals and CommunitiesThere are many intangible reasons why a community chooses to host a festival such as socio-cultural, economic, political and environmental and each reason is not mutually exclusive (Backman et al, 1995).The Northern Rivers region stands apart from the rest of rural Australia as living as if the future matters. This is a very powerful attractor in these times of urban decay and environmental despair (Dunstan, 1994:2).Sense of place, can be described as, the common ground where interpretation and community development meets in a concern to create or enhance a sense of place, to establish what is significant and valued in the environment or heritage of a particular community, and to provide action for its wider appreciation and conservation (Binks, 1989:191 cited Trotter, 1998).Democratic communities take responsibility for their future. It is undeniable that cohesive community events based on ideals create a sense of community. The excitement and joy that people feel when they work together for their community and future means that they will attempt to recreate that experience. It becomes their preferred way (Emery, 1995:70).&#8230;the notion of community is always something of a myth. A community implies a coherent entity with a clear identity and a commonality of purpose. The reality is that communities, more often than not, are made up of an agglomeration of factions and interest groups often locked in competitive relationships (Smit, 1995 cited in Joppe, 1996:475).Community, the custodians of the content of Australian tourism, must be enabled to participate in tourism by forming its content. Only if Australians are involved in tourism will it survive, (Wood, 1993:7).Through direct contact and interaction with each festival, the qualitative exploratory study reveals how in formal and informal ways participants at the four case study sites demonstrate the diverse and fragmented nature of festivals. Although none of these festivals is identical, some consistent patterns do emerge to demonstrate that comparisons can be developed. These patterns have their own advantages and disadvantages and it is evident that success or failure is not linked to a particular model for such festivals. Each community has an ongoing challenge of determining how their festival can best meet its needs presently and into the future. Each is trying to keep pace with the changes that are taking place within their communities, within the region and from external forces. This is where the study also generates new knowledge: tracking the changes occurring in community festivals in contemporary regional Australia.Through a systematic analysis of data the study significantly contributes to our understanding of the character of community festivals. Through surveys, interviews, media analysis, photographic images and critical observation, it clearly observes that social, economic and environmental issues currently presented in the literature require greater deconstruction and critical engagement. Rich and quilted description of the festivals informs this research providing grounded scholarly investigation. This approach leads to a greater understanding of significant social and cultural agendas in regional communities. Festivals add value to communities. They creatively produce and embed culture. They can be viewed as celebrations of resilience.Through a systematic analysis of data the study significantly contributes to our understanding of the character of community festivals.

They can be viewed as celebrations of resilience.At the core of the investigation is an analysis of how the process of nourishing resilience by making inclusive celebrations, unleashes relationships between many stakeholders. Each participant contributes to the program, traditions, cultural practices, impact and reach of events with differing voices and emphases.In principle, festivals and their host communities offer individual members a framework for attending to general aspects of life. This study reaffirms that community festivals particularly hold a significant position in three areas of the human condition. They celebrate a sense of place through organising inclusive activities in specific safe environments. They provide a vehicle for communities to host visitors and share such activities as representations of communally agreed values, interests and aspirations. Finally, they are the outward manifestation of the identity of the community and provide a distinctive identifier of place and people.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">festivals</field><field name="subject">resiliance</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">regional</field><field name="subject">cultural tourism</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">partnerships</field><field name="subject">social capital</field><field name="subject">celebrations</field><field name="subject">Arts and Humanities</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/90</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and testing a model of cooperative interorganisational relationships (IORs) in product innovation in an Australian manufacturing context: a multi-stakeholder perspective</field><field name="creator">von der Heidt, Tania</field><field name="description">As fast-growth economies, such as China and India are dominating export markets, innovation in the manufacturing industries of slower, developed  economies, such as Australia is a survival issue. Particularly small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMMEs) with limited internal innovation resources and capabilities are suffering. Corresponding with this development, academic interest in analysing the relationship between innovative performance of small firms and their recourse to external resources, especially through interorganisational relationships (IORs) has been growing over the last ten to fifteen years. To date the emerging literature has given limited attention to the systematic empirical assessment of the relationship and innovation inputs and outputs of cooperative product innovation. Furthermore, most of the literature focuses on cooperative innovation IORs with customer stakeholders, ignoring the potential role played by other external stakeholder groups, such as suppliers, industry partners and research/advisory organisations. To this end, this thesis investigated the following research question: What are the relationships between IOR- and innovation-oriented antecedents and consequences of cooperative product innovation and how effective for overall firm performance is product innovation cooperation with multiple stakeholders? A six-factor multi-stakeholder model of cooperative IORs in product innovation for Australian manufacturers was developed from a strategy-structure-performance-based model of marketing channel relationship structure. It synthesised and built upon prior models of cooperative product innovation and incorporated concepts and measures drawn from the IOR and product innovation literatures. The central, structure-based construct (measurement model) developed was stakeholder involvement in product innovation (SIPI). Two factors were used to predict SIPI: Stakeholder orientation (SO) and Product innovation orientation (PIO). A further two factors represented outcomes of SIPI: Relationship quality (RQ) and Product innovation performance (PIP). A sixth factor - Overall firm performance (OFP) - was also measured to assess the broader implications of the model. Two objective, single-item variables were also included in the model &#8211; relative Product innovation spending (associated with PIO) and Sales growth (associated with OFP).To address the multi-stakeholder perspective, four external stakeholder groups most likely to be involved in a manufacturer&#8217;s product innovation (customers, suppliers, industry partners (competitors) and research/advisory organisations) were assessed. Eight hypotheses positing associations between the six constructs were developed. As strategic data was required, the research method for primary data collection was a survey of CEOs/General Managers of Australian machinery and equipment manufacturers, predominately SMMEs. A questionnaire was designed to measure their opinions about the firm&#8217;s relationships with each of the four stakeholder groups in product innovation as well as their views on the firm&#8217;s product innovation orientation and performance. Following extensive pre-testing of the questionnaire, it was distributed by mail and online to the senior managers. Data obtained from 120 respondents was used in the research.Using a two-step structural equation modelling (SEM): confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) approach, examinations of parameter estimates, fit and residuals were used to test the individual constructs for validity. Composite reliability and average variance extracted were used to test for construct reliability. An overall (multi-stakeholder) structural model, as well as four single-stakeholder models, of key relationship- and innovation-oriented antecedents and consequences of cooperative product innovation were then tested using SEM AMOS software. Meaningful modifications of the hypothesised model were undertaken to improve model fit. The four modified single-stakeholder models and the overall (multistakeholder) model were found to provide a satisfactory fit. Statistically significant standard coefficients for each of the latent constructs provided evidence of the importance of each element as an input or outcome of cooperative innovation. The results indicated that, as posited, a firm&#8217;s Product innovation orientation (PIO) was positively associated with its Stakeholder orientation (SO). SO, in turn, was a valid antecedent of cooperative product innovation (SIPI). The hypothesised direct path from SIPI to RQ was, however, not supported. Instead, SIPI was found to partially mediate the SO-RQ association, further strengthening that positive link. Surprisingly, PIO did not appear to significantly influence cooperative innovation SIPI. Instead, PIO was found to be a strong and direct antecedent of market- and technical-oriented PIP, whereby the cooperative innovation construct SIPI did not materially impact Product innovation performance PIP. Product innovation spending directly influenced technical-oriented PIP only. RQ was a valid predictor of Sales growth, but not of Overall firm performance OFP. While market-oriented PIP was found to lead to stronger assessments of OFP, increased technical-oriented PIP negatively impacted on OFP. Consequently, seven of the eight hypotheses relating to the research model were accepted in part or full, and one hypothesis was rejected.Overall, qualified support was found for the central proposition: Higher (sales) growth manufacturers tend to pay more attention to their relationships with the top firms in each of four stakeholders groups (customers, suppliers, industry partners and advisory/research firms), involve these firms more in product innovation activities and perceive their relationships to be of higher &#8216;quality&#8217;. Firms with sound overall firm performance (return on investment, net profit, market share and overall business performance) tend to be more product innovation focused (in terms of strategy and spending) and achieve product innovations, which are successful both technologically and market-wise. However, stakeholder involvement in product innovation is not as good a predictor of product innovation outcomes as is the firm&#8217;s product innovation orientation (strategy).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/70</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The play(fulness) of law</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Nicole</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I undertake an investigation into the relationship between play, playfulness and law. Law relies on a certain form of play, rule-bound orderly play; this is demonstrated, for example, in the ceremony of the trial. Furthermore, underpinning every legal system, we find a different form of play: the spontaneous and disruptive performances of revolutionary violence which found every state. Play can be, in fact, an unpredictable force. Play can disrupt or derail the structured performances of law; play can deflect the violence of the state. I am interested in the dramatic possibilities of using subversive play, or playfulness, as a strategy for negotiating violence. This is, in many respects, a postmodernist work. I draw upon and use self-reflective narrative, conduct my investigation by way of case studies, seek to expose the relationships of power behind both text and performance, and deconstruct accepted understandings of terms like law and play. It is also an interdisciplinary work, in which I draw upon the &#8216;interdiscipline&#8217; of performance studies. In integrating performance studies theory with law, and in considering law as yet another cultural performance, I have disregarded the artificial boundaries which positivist legal scholars seek to construct between law and (non)law. Positivists view law as a set of norms and rules; in law, the written text is sacrosanct. I have adopted the approach of performance studies theorists, who view all social and cultural activities as performance and regard culture as a verb rather than as a noun. Law might endure as text, but it is made as performance. My first set of case studies originate in the contemporary war on terror. Terrorism can itself be viewed as a performative phenomenon and form of (dark) play; it is also, clearly, about violence. I undertake a comparative critique of two different performative responses to the war on terror: namely, the terror trials and the theatre of dissent. I consider the interplay between the violence of terrorism and the violence of law in the terror trials. I also look at the extent to which the theatre of dissent &#8216;plays&#8217; with different forms of violence in order to disrupt the authority of the state. The different functions and roles of these two forms of cultural performance become apparent in their engagement with violence and with the state, their portrayal of difference, their exposure to mediatisation, and their relationship with the &#8216;truth&#8217;.There is little playfulness in the play of the terror trials, or in the play of the theatre of dissent. I turn, therefore, to playfulness in law. I consider eruptions of playfulness in the courtroom. I also look at the transformation of law into play through the phenomenon of documentary theatre. I am intrigued by the subversive and playful possibilities in providing the text of law with a different performative force, and in uncoupling law from violence through re-performance as theatre. My final set of case studies originate in the playful performances of environmental protest. We find different forms of play characterising and underpinning the rationale for such performances. Play in its pre-rational guise is embraced as a strategy to capture the media&#8217;s attention and confound violence against nature. Play, in its ideological association with wilderness, appears in a more solemn guise. Using case studies drawn from the war on the environment, I investigate the relative efficacy and symbolic value of different forms of play, the pre-rational play of direct action and the rational play of legal performances, in countering violence against nature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="subject">playfulness</field><field name="subject">play</field><field name="subject">law</field><field name="subject">theatre</field><field name="subject">terrorism</field><field name="subject">trials</field><field name="subject">protest</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">Law</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/65</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Unsaid&#8217; voices of middle-level women nurses&#8217; experience of Western Australian public hospitals: an integrated feminist postmodern ethnography</field><field name="creator">Pannowitz, Helen K</field><field name="description">The context for this research was the socio-political, culturally constructed, lived experience of eight women nurses who held middle-level positions in two Western Australian public hospitals. Glass and Davis&#8217; (1998) integrated feminist postmodern model for nursing research framed the design for the ethnographic investigation.The researcher used an innovative self-developed trifocality method: realist; critical feminist; and feminist postmodern to critique ethnographic data against the research aim and objectives and reflexively engaged with the women nurses to reveal unacknowledged individual and collective insights. Participant observation, critical conversation, and reflective field/journaling were used as triangulated data collection methods. The methodology revealed the local, particular, historical, taken-for-granted and traditionally gender-biased subjugated voices of individual women nurses as legitimate sites for the production of knowledge and insights.The trifocal data analysis revealed multiple intersecting layers of meanings and insights. The participants unacknowledged &#8216;unsaid&#8217; experiences were viewed as exemplar &#8216;states of being&#8217;, or subjectivity positions, of their multiple and temporal realities. Inherent within the subjectivity positions was their personal, professional and corporate efforts, assumed as self-managing strategies and implicit knowledge, to enact work roles.Deeper critique, applying feminist poststructuralism (Lather 1991b) and postmodern notions of power/knowledge networks of relationships (Foucault 1980b) revealed three competing socio-political culturally constructed discourses. Firstly, the participants&#8217; were embedded within an empowering &#8216;Discourse of Values Attributed to Nursing/Between a Rock and a Hard Place&#8217;. Secondly, they were influenced by, and resistant to the patriarchally dominant &#8216;Discourse of Bureaucratic Managerialism Discourse/Absence of Care&#8217;.  thirdly, they functioned within the influence of the disempowering &#8216;Discourse Medical Science/Working the Margins&#8217;.This research contributes to the knowledge base of scholarly work that exists about nurses, women nurses specifically, concerning the meaning of the experiences of practicing in the confluence of corporate and professional responsibilities. At the personal participant level the insights contribute to emancipatory consciousness-raising. The insights also positively contribute to the recommendations made in The Report of the Western Australian Study of Nursing and Midwifery (Pinch &amp; Della 2001). The insights may evoke wider awareness of the disempowering influence of managerialism upon professional practice and inter-professional relationships. Finally, the unique trifocal data analysis method contributes to the body of nursing and social science research knowledge.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing</field><field name="subject">feminism</field><field name="subject">post moderism</field><field name="subject">ethnograohy</field><field name="subject">corporate management</field><field name="subject">public hospital</field><field name="subject">emancipatory qualitative methodology</field><field name="subject">professional clinical specialist</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/64</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate entrepreneurship and government business enterprises: the pre-paradigmatic dance of the chameleon</field><field name="creator">Sadler, Robert John</field><field name="description">The existing research into corporate entrepreneurship is based upon experiences in the private sector. Reforms of public sectors throughout the western world are focussing on entrepreneurial practices as part of a program to align public sector management practices with those of the private sector.This research concentrates on corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector and specifically addresses opportunities for the emergence of corporate entrepreneurship in Government Business Enterprises (&#8220;GBEs&#8221;).The literature assumes that entrepreneurial practices in the private sector may be foisted upon the public sector. The paper proposes that corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector is the result of different influencing factors and involves different processes from its private sector counterpart.Building on private sector research this research examines those factors that stimulate and constrain corporate entrepreneurship in the public sector. It addresses the extent to which the influences of factors that stimulate corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector are replicated in GBEs. This analysis generates a model that is founded on:1. Three research propositions that concern the correlation between those factors that foster corporate entrepreneurship in the private sector and those applicable to GBEs. They also address the preponderance of those facilitating factors in corporatised and non-corporatised GBEs; and2. An investigation into the manner in which the facilitating factors influence opportunities for the emergence of corporate entrepreneurship and the extent of that potential emergence. The presence or absence of factors that stimulate or constrain corporate entrepreneurship, however, does not explain its occurrence or absence. Public sector organisations which ensure that the influence of those factors that facilitate corporate entrepreneurship outweigh the influence of the inhibiting factors are more likely to be ready and able to react to opportunities to create value by adopting entrepreneurial processes. This is the basis of a Model that is developed and refined during the course of the paper.The Research Propositions were tested by a survey of 322 publicly urban water businesses located throughout Australia. The Model was illuminated and enhanced by considering case studies from twelve urban water businesses. The literature demonstrates that reforms to the public sector since the late 1970&#8217;s have created opportunities for corporate entrepreneurship. The literature also reveals that entrepreneurship is a strategic phenomenon. This paper demonstrates that the environment within which corporate entrepreneurship may occur is influenced by the organisation&#8217;s existence within either the public or the private sector and, within the public sector, the environmental and operating features of the entity as either a corporatised GBE, a non-corporatised GBE or other structure.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">public sector management</field><field name="subject">public sector reform</field><field name="subject">corporate entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">government business enterprise</field><field name="subject">corporatisation</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/38</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading innovation and entrepreneurship: an action research study in the Australian red meat industry</field><field name="creator">Pitt, Christine Anne</field><field name="description">The dynamic and often hostile competitive landscape of the twenty-first century has created significant threats to existing patterns of successful competition. A review of the extant literature and research about innovation and entrepreneurship identifies their importance to ensuring corporate vitality and wealth generation in today&#8217;s global economy. For over one hundred andfifty years the foundation of Australia&#8217;s prosperity has been from resource based industries such as agriculture and mining. Changes in the world economy clearly require a much broader range of globally competitive industries to sustain Australia&#8217;s strong economic position. It is proposed that the older more traditional industries must also undergo rapid transformation if they are to maintain their competitive advantage. This thesis describes an action research study conducted over four years (2002-2006) in the Australian red meat industry. The study aimed to extend the body of knowledge on innovation and entrepreneurship in the industry. It also sought to explore options for improving practice through interventions which would accelerate the development of firm innovation capabilities and a culture of innovation more broadly across the industry.The thesis articulates a comprehensive contextual framework of the sector&#8217;s innovation and entrepreneurship system and an associated model of firm innovation and entrepreneurial capability. In addition, a new methodology for mapping the effectiveness of an innovation system is developed based on the emerging concept of system failures. By applying this methodology, a new SI-Intervention Framework is developed and a suite of intervention projects is tested for acceptance and potential impact with industry participants.It is proposed that the thesis offers a contribution to knowledge through convergence of the related fields of innovation and entrepreneurship into a single conceptual framework. In addition, the development of new theoretical and analytical models and methodologies build on and extend the work of previous researchers. Evidence of improved practice is demonstrated in relation to incorporation of the new framework and methodologies into the industry&#8217;s future innovation strategy, building internal capability in the innovation intervention agency, and acceptance by industry participants of the new approach.It is acknowledged that the models and concepts articulated in this thesis are at an early stage of development and that there is a significant amount of further research required. Similarly, as the study is focused on a single case, no attempt is made to offer broad generalisations. The value of the study will ultimately be determined by the specifics of future research contexts and can only be evaluated to the extent that it seems accurate, appropriate and authentic from the reader&#8217;s own perspective.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">innovation</field><field name="subject">entrepreneurship</field><field name="subject">innovations systems</field><field name="subject">innovation system failures</field><field name="subject">firm innovation</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">food industry</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/36</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hedge funds and China&#8217;s stock market: a study on factors influencing investment decisions by fund managers</field><field name="creator">Phan, Alan</field><field name="description">Hedge funds and China&#8217;s stock market: a study on factors influencing investment decisions by fund managersThe research was conducted using a web-based questionnaire sent to all Asia-related hedge funds, worldwide. Analysis of the collected data revealed that the factors influencing the portfolio investments made in China by fund managers differed from the factors which influence investment in global and emerging markets. While market conditions, market timing and changes in earning estimates are the top three influencing factors on investment decisions on global stock exchanges, fund managers are more influenced by global trend, potential growth and company size when dealing with China&#8217;s stock market. Research results also support the hypotheses that there are relationships between size of fund, trading style and personal expertise of managers and the factors influencing investment decisions.The international hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market are two fast-growing entities of global capital markets. Stronger interaction between these two institutions in the future would create important implications for the financial world. The objective of this research is to identify factors that influence investment decisions by hedge fund managers in relation to China&#8217;s stock market.The following implications can be extracted from this research:(1) If China&#8217;s stock market is classified within the Emerging Markets Index, adjustments are necessary and provision should be made reflecting investor criteria for China.(2) Global trends and the potential growth of China were the two most attractive factors influencing investment decisions, suggesting a &#8216;herding&#8217; tendency and &#8216;attention-grabbing&#8217; bias of hedge fund managers.(3) Company evaluation remains important to hedge fund managers, suggesting that Chinese government regulators should implement reforms to improve quality of listed firms.(4) Gaps in the research on China&#8217;s stock market as well as the outcomes of this research indicate that further studies on the international hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market could reveal new perspectives and enhancements to the current body of knowledge on these subjects. This thesis consists of six chapters. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the research context and research justification. The research problem and questions are identified, and the theoretical framework and hypotheses are constructed. Chapter 2 presents an overview of the hedge fund industry and China&#8217;s stock market. Chapter 3 examines the literature: factors that influence investment decisions in global, emerging markets and in particular, China&#8217;s stock market. A framework of an 8-step decision-making process was developed. Chapter 4 researches alternative methodologies and presents a justification for the selection of the research methodology. Chapter 5 summarises the results of the data analysis and interpretation. Chapter 6 discusses the conclusions, implications, contributions and limitations of the research. Recommendations for further research are also included.The outcomes of this research are expected to benefit all participants of the global financial industry, including institutional and individual investors; executives in banking, insurance and securities businesses; financiers of listed firms and multinational corporations; government regulators and independent research analysts. Other beneficiaries will be academics and the media.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hedge funds</field><field name="subject">China&#8217;s stock market</field><field name="subject">portfolio investment</field><field name="subject">decision making process</field><field name="subject">influencing factors</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Asia</field><field name="subject">capital markets</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/35</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Financial management and profitability of small and medium enterprises</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Kieu Minh</field><field name="description">After a decade of reforming policy, building and developing the multi-sector market economy, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Vietnam have developed strongly and contributed to creating employment, increasing GDP, and raising the nation&#8217;s volume of exports. However, SMEs have found difficulties on the way to development due to lack of management experience and financial resources, and due to uncertainty within the business environment. As a result, SMEs often faced obstacles during their operations. This thesis examines the relationship between financial management and profitability of SMEs to determine whether financial management practices and financial characteristics impact on SME profitability. Objectives of the thesis are (1) to investigate and describe features of financial management practices and financial characteristics of SMEs in Vietnam, (2) to develop and test a model of SME profitability, and (3) to contribute knowledge of the relationships between financial management and characteristics to improve SME profitability by using tools of efficient financial management. In terms of structure, the thesis has six chapters. The thesis begins by defining the research problem and questions, and providing a justification for the research study. Chapter one also reviews the research background, and presents definitions of terms, significance and scope of the study. Chapter two examines the economic background, business structure and the development of SMEs in Vietnam. This chapter also reviews previous research related to financial management for SMEs in Vietnam to identify gaps between financial management for SMEs in Vietnam and financial management for SMEs worldwide. Chapter three reviews financial management including financial management practices, financial characteristics and profitability of SMEs around the world, especially in the developed economies such as the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia and Canada. This review emphasizes profitability and the impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are to review previous research related to the areas of financial management practices, financial characteristics, and profitability of SMEs and to build a model of the impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. Chapter four discusses aspects of the research methodology including research design, data collection and data analysis methods, and hypothesis testing to support the model. Objectives of this chapter are: (1) to justify the research methodology of this study, (2) to explain research methodology used in the study, and (3) to demonstrate how research design, and data collection and analysis can be utilized in this study to answer the research questions outlined in the chapter 1. Data analysis and findings are presented in chapter five. This chapter presents descriptive findings of financial management practices, financial characteristics and SME profitability and findings of the research study related to testing the model of SME profitability. Objectives of this chapter are (1) to systematically present the descriptive findings of the research study, (2) to interpret significance of these findings based on data analysis, (3) to present the results of testing the model of SME profitability, and (4) to explain how the model, developed from a literature review, was supported by data analysis. Finally, the thesis ends with chapter six where conclusions are summarized and applications of the research findings are indicated for the financial management practitioners. The thesis provides descriptive findings of financial management practices and financial characteristics and demonstrates the simultaneous impact of financial management practices and financial characteristics on SME profitability. In addition, the research study provides a model of SME profitability, in which profitability was found to be related to financial management practices and financial characteristics. With the exception of debt ratios, all other variables including current ratio, total asset turnover, working capital management and short-term planning practices, fixed asset management and long-term planning practices, and financial and accounting information systems were found to be significantly related to SME profitability. With the findings as presented above, this research study provides many implications for financial management practices and contributes to knowledge of financial management of SMEs. The model of SME profitability can be used as guidance for actions to improve the profitability of SMEs in Vietnam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SMEs</field><field name="subject">financial characteristics</field><field name="subject">financial management practices</field><field name="subject">profitability</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial and Small Business Operations</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/32</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An alternative to existing Australian research and teaching models: the Japanangka teaching and research paradigm, an Australian Aboriginal model</field><field name="creator">West, Errol George</field><field name="description">I decided to write this thesis many years ago and in the process of &#8216;becoming&#8217; a Palawa man I finally understood the global agenda between black and white Australians and the direct actions required to attain a traditional form of Aboriginal democracy. I share in this understanding in this thesis. Mind you I share with trepidation because the options are very existential to the prevailing discourse. However a doctoral thesis will add to the body of knowledge not simply to confirm existing theoretical discourse or to leave this discourse un-challenged. Therefore this thesis is about the critical mass of cultural variables pertaining to teaching of Australian Indigenous peoples and the conduct of meaningful research. Its primary intent is to offer an alternative to the inappropriate methodologies that currently apply in the generic areas of pedagogy and research (in their broadest sense). In my opinion at present both these areas are pathologically dominated by Western thought. The idea of change and alternative paradigms is addressed in the introduction and this thesis is not intended to achieve anything more than a hearing of these options. This is why the discourse of this knowledge terrain in this thesis is so diverse and so demanding of the reader. The core notion of this discourse is the Japanangka Teaching and Research Paradigm.The Japanangka Teaching and Research Paradigm has as its core the articulation of eight dimensions or sub-paradigms. These are the quality of life dimensions: Cultural, Spiritual, Secular, and the other five: Intellectual, Political, Practical, Personal and Public dimensions. These eight constitute the sum of human experience relevant to the daily lives of Aborigines and as such are key categories to the unravelling of the seemingly imponderable mystery of &#8220;learning journey paths&#8221; so critical to the success of our students in formal Western education activities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilingual, Multilingual, and Multicultural Education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/14</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Just renting': the experiences of sole mother non-home owners living in northern NSW</field><field name="creator">Holdsworth, Louise</field><field name="description">The goal of owning one&#8217;s home, as opposed to &#8216;just renting&#8217;, is deeply ingrained in Australian culture. Indeed, home ownership in Australia is seen as &#8216;natural&#8217; and has been adopted by the majority as the tenure of choice. People have accepted assumptions that have shaped housing discourse which normalises home ownership as hegemonic. In this thesis I argue that the prevailing attitude is that home ownership equates with social and personal attributes such as success, belongingness and stability, giving the home owner greater status, power and choice compared to renters. In addition, despite the various pressures faced by many home owners, home ownership can also facilitate an increased sense of community because it enables long term and secure housing. This in turn contributes to the notion of &#8216;home&#8217; and sense of identity which comes through allowing people to put down deep roots and to express personal tastes.Property ownership, as the key determinant of class in Australia, separates the &#8216;haves&#8217; from the &#8216;have nots&#8217;. However, property prices have risen beyond the means of many low income households resulting in a housing affordability crisis. This crisis has excluded some groups from achieving the sought after goal of home ownership and has left them vulnerable to the vagaries of the private rental market. Others have entered into the housing market and face financial hardship due to massive debt. Consequently, this situation has served to challenge the widely held assumption that Australia is an egalitarian society. As well, property has largely taken on the instrumental purpose of an investment opportunity rather than a place that provides the basic needs of shelter, security and a sense of belonging and wellbeing. Thus the very nature of the meaning of &#8216;home&#8217; has altered in light of this situation with housing increasingly seen as a commodity.Low income, non-home owning sole mother headed families constitute a social group that is particularly vulnerable to, and disadvantaged by, their housing situation. This qualitative study draws on a critical feminist approach and utilises in-depth interviews to explore the housing experiences of thirty-two sole mother renters living in Northern NSW. Critical feminist research endeavours to present the views &#8211; the &#8216;voices&#8217; - of those participating in the research. In so doing, the study fills an important gap in current housing research and facilitates a greater awareness of what it means to rent on a low income in contemporary Australia. This approach is markedly different to many utilised in housing related research which often results in the particular concerns of vulnerable social groups being indistinguishable from others that are faring well within the neo-liberal, &#8216;free market&#8217; approach to housing.By also examining contemporary housing policy, such as the push towards rent assistance at the expense of social housing, along with the promotion of home ownership for those who can afford it, underlying assumptions and hidden power imbalances are made apparent. The study has found that for many of the women such policies work directly against their perceived interests as well as social and personal aspirations. A key finding is that this group is excluded from a socially desirable resource and are rendered invisible, while simultaneously being subjected to high levels of surveillance within an institutionalised culture of watching and noticing. It is argued that the challenges faced by this group of women need to be acknowledged. Policy needs to be introduced that recognises that the main function of housing should be to provide secure and stable homes for all, which after all is both a basic need and a right.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/13</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of aromatherapy: a case study of the professionalisation of complementary and alternative medicine in the Australian health care system</field><field name="creator">Sheen, Janelle Gwen</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to examine aromatherapy practice in relation to its claim of being or becoming a profession. This process of professionalisation is explored within the current context where the status of complementary and alternative medicines within the Australian health care system, like aromatherapy practice, is currently influenced by medical dominance and broader social and political scrutiny. This investigation of aromatherapy practice may provide a model for the general professionalisation, or development, of complementary and alternative medicine in Australian health care today. Critical theory was employed as the primary methodology of this study. As critical theory has no defined method for data collection, grounded theory data collection and analysis methods were used to obtain current and relevant data from two of the most prominent users of aromatherapy practice in health care, aromatherapists and nurses.The study found that while aromatherapy is often referred to as a profession, it fails to meet the criteria for being considered a profession in the &#8216;true&#8217; sense. The data also revealed felt dissatisfactions experienced by aromatherapists&#8217; to be due to the lack of recognition of the practice and a perceived double bind regarding the need to establish an appropriate knowledge base via scientific research and maintaining the &#8216;essence&#8217; of aromatherapy practice. Considering the professionalisation process and the requirements of the system (health care and Government) a number of potential pathways for the development of aromatherapy practice were explored. The findings and discussion have relevance to other complementary and alternative modalities endeavouring to professionalise and or increase their status within the Australian health care system. In addition the study considers the related public felt dissatisfaction and revealed false consciousness relating to a broader social change and the integration of holistic and biomedical practices in health care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/3</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards, wellbeing : Creative inquiries into an experiential arts-based healing practice in Aboriginal contexts</field><field name="creator">Miller, Judith Christian</field><field name="description">This research project is located in the context of Aboriginal health and education, and in particular, emotional and social wellbeing, recognising the critical need for effective mental health services and resilient, well-trained workers in the field of mental health.Mental health is understood to include a broad spectrum of conditions with extreme and chronic mental illness at one end and resilience or wellbeing at the other &#8211; the socalled &#8216;soft end&#8217; of the social health spectrum. While recognising that the lines of demarcation between one category and another are grey, my thesis addresses the problems at the latter end of the spectrum: problems of excessive pain; the grief and despair caused by dispossession, loss of place, family and identity; and the deep frustration, humiliation and anger that results in family violence and child sexual abuse, intergenerational substance abuse, neglect and poor physical health. It is my position that very many Aboriginal people who need to make changes in their lives in order to feel well and functional in the world are not suffering from a Western disease but from the transgenerational consequences of colonisation. In recognition of the notion that Aboriginal wellbeing is everybody&#8217;s business, this PhD research project represents my response to these consequences.While popular assumptions are made about the relevance of art to Aboriginal health and many Aboriginal people testify to the fact that their engagement with art (writing, drama, dance, music and visual art etc.) has brought about significant change in their lives, there is no available research in Australia that supports the development of an arts-based approach to learning/therapy/wellbeing that has, for reasons that are well understood, the potential to suit the needs of Aboriginal people.Addressing this gap in the research, I inquire into an experiential, arts-based, emotionfocused, narrative-orientated, constructivist approach to healing in the tradition of humanistic psychology, which emphasises the importance of an emancipatory, clientcentred processes that facilitates the development of awareness, creativity, clarity of expression and critical reflection. The position I take breaks with the traditions of the biomedical model and conforms to the now widely held view that psychology and counselling treatment programs for Aboriginal people must address the whole person, emotionally/spiritually, mentally and physically, responding to the individual in his/her sociopolitical and historical context. Expressive arts therapy, the multi-modal approach to healing explored in this thesis, lays claim to these intentions.In this project, I locate myself as the researcher/practitioner whose life-stance is expressive of the phenomenological principles of experiential learning and reflexivity. Accordingly, I have drawn on a number of closely related research methodologies all of which, I argue, are consistent with phenomenology and Indigenous, participatory research practices: critical action research, art-based research and phenomenological research methodology. These modes of inquiry are linked through principles that value subjective experience and allow for a diversity of ways of knowing. Embracing an expanded field of ways of knowing respectful of Indigenous epistemologies is at the core of the arts-based therapy program under investigation.Expressive arts therapy, in this research project, was delivered in two modes: one was a series of nine full-day group workshops conducted over an academic semester; the other was a series of ten intensive individual therapy sessions with three participants conducted over the period of a year. The participants or &#8216;co-researchers&#8217; were drawn from the College of Indigenous Australian Peoples and the Education and Art departments at Southern Cross University. Three mature-age Aboriginal students who had engaged in the Masters of Indigenous Studies program emerged as the core participants who, having contributed to the development stage of the project, followed the program through the group workshops to the final interviews at the end of the series of individual sessions.This thesis is, in part, an illustrated narrative of the in-depth work the core participants did with me in both the context of the group and individually. It invites the active participation of the reader. Insights into the nature and impact of expressive arts therapy are offered through a focus on the lived experience of the three core participants, their reflections on the program and their observations of the changes they made in their lives. An important parameter that I set, determined that the ultimate voices of authority were to be those of the participants. I was not at liberty to look for meanings that went beyond their experience and understanding.I argue that the experiences of expressive arts therapy re-presented in this thesis demonstrate that expressive arts therapy is in principle consistent with current approaches to Aboriginal psychology and counselling currently recommended by Aboriginal professionals and spokespeople in the field of Aboriginal health. Furthermore this body of work demonstrates that expressive arts therapy is a culturally appropriate intervention grounded in a creative process that has the potential to facilitate healing and change in the lives of people suffering from the long-term consequences of damaging childhoods.It is my hope that this approach to healing will be further researched and developed and, with culturally appropriate terms of reference, adapted to a wide variety of existing community services &#8211; rightfully, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander practitioners working for the wellbeing of their own people.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wellbeing</field><field name="subject">experiential learning</field><field name="subject">expressive arts therapy</field><field name="subject">change</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal mental health</field><field name="subject">social and emotional wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Arts-based healing</field><field name="subject">Community Health and Preventive Medicine</field><field name="subject">Psychiatry and Psychology</field><field name="subject">Public Health Education and Promotion</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/104</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing an integrated e-learning culture: a model grounded in the Australian Army experience</field><field name="creator">Newton, Diane</field><field name="description">Understanding the influences on e-learning effectiveness in workplaces is a necessary, but contentious task. The transfer of knowledge about e-learning from higher education to workplace situations has resulted in discursive tensions between expectations and practice. Measurement of the aspects of e-learning effectiveness is often discussed in the literature in terms of discrete economic, pedagogical and technological criteria. Few studies have investigated e-learning use in terms of the complexity of factors in a workplace environment and there is a scarcity of relevant substantive models of e-learning effectiveness factors in workplace contexts. This study aimed to improve understanding of the factors influencing e-learning effectiveness, particularly in large, dispersed workplaces and to develop a model based on the understanding of these factors. This study represents the first external research into the Australian Army&#8217;s e-learning projects. The Army was selected as a large, dispersed workplace organisation with ten years experience in designing and using multimedia rich CD-ROM learning materials. The Army had undertaken trialing and evaluation of its e-learning courses prior to providing substantial infrastructure for implementation in training centres. These evaluations indicated e-learning effectiveness in terms of training efficiencies and learning outcomes that at least matched traditional face-to-face classroom instruction. That is, that e-learning fitted with the training requirements. The study was aimed at the understanding of how the Army&#8217;s workplace environment was influencing the effectiveness of e-learning courses from multiple perspectives.Using an inductive Grounded Theory approach provided an established analytical method for developing a substantive model. While the field-based research was limited to a single organisation, it included multiple sites across Australia and a cross-section of e-learning activities and respondents throughout the organisational hierarchy. The main data source was 101 open-ended interviews conducted with respondents at Army bases or by phone. Where interviewing was not possible due to Army operational concerns, questionnaires were used (129 responses). Other data sources included Army documents and the researcher&#8217;s observations and participation in e-learning classes.While the Army&#8217;s internal evaluation processes had justified the adoption of e-learning courses, it was evident in the study that the interaction of factors within the Army&#8217;s culture was influencing perceptions and experiences of e-learning effectiveness. An Integrated E-learning Culture Model (IECM) based on the analysis of stakeholder perspectives in the Army is presented. The IECM is based on the four factors that emerged as influencing e-learning effectiveness, which were organisational priorities, the learning environment, the instructor&#8217;s role and learners&#8217; needs. The main concern for respondents was to manage tensions associated with these four factors by integrating e-learning into the organisational culture. That is, e-learning effectiveness was discussed in terms of a process of alignment of the e-learning culture with the organisational culture.Comparison of the IECM with some empirical studies of e-learning use in other large, dispersed workplaces indicates its relevance outside the Army context. An E-learning Comparative Alignment Framework (ECAF) for using the IECM in other research was developed in this study. Further comparison of the ECAF with alignment theories from related research disciplines suggests areas for further theoretical research. This thesis proposes that by adopting the perspective that e-learning environments are not value-free, it is possible to identify and align the competing priorities and discourses that influence how e-learning effectiveness is constructed and experienced in an organisation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Assessment, Evaluation, and Research</field><field name="subject">Instructional Media Design</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/62</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grey matters: does Bacopa monnieri improve memory performance in older persons</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Annette Kay</field><field name="description">Background This thesis investigated the efficacy and safety of Bacopa monnieri in improving memory in healthy Australians over the age of 55-years. A review of the literature showed that memory impairment and dementia are increasingly prevalent in the current demographic climate of an ageing population. As well as the pathological cognitive loss of neurodegenerative disease, many older persons are experiencing memory loss as part of the physiological process of ageing.  Bacopa monnieri is a herbal medicine used since antiquity in the traditional Ayurvedic medical system of India for its cognitive enhancing effects. A number of pre-clinical and clinical studies support this traditional usage. Laboratory studies have demonstrated antioxidant and cholinergic actions in the brain as well as improved memory and cognitive performance in animal models.  Human trials of Bacopa have also demonstrated improved memory performance. Some of these trials are limited by methodological flaws such as lack of blinding, small sample sizes, or use of outcome measurements which are not well validated. However, a small number of well designed human trials provide evidence for efficacy in cognitive and memory performance improvement. The current study was employed to extend on previous findings by assessing the efficacy and safety of Bacopa in the aged population specifically, as it is in this population that memory impairment becomes apparent.  Aims 1. To assess the efficacy of Bacopa monnieri in improving memory in healthy Australians over the age of 55-years. 2. To assess whether the use of Bacopa is associated with side-effects  Design A 12-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial.  Participants Participants were self selected from the general population. They were aged 55-years or over at the commencement of the trial. Participants were without dementia, depression or other serious health conditions and did not use psychotropic medications.  Intervention Participants were randomised to one of two treatment conditions, either a tableted extract of Bacopa monnieri called Bacomind&#8482; (300mg/day, standardised to contain at least 40% bacosides), or an identical placebo.  Participants attended three clinical evaluations: the first an initial screening session, the second a baseline evaluation of neuropsychological function and subjective memory performance at the commencement of the trial and the third, an end-of-trial outcome evaluation at 12-weeks, during which neuropsychological function and subjective memory performance were again assessed along with side-effects and study compliance.  Primary Outcome Measures Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (CFT), Memory Complaint Questionnaire (MAC-Q), and Trail Making Test (TMT)  Results From 136 people who elected to participate, 103 people met study entry criteria and 98 of these commenced the trial. Of these, 81 participants completed the trial and provided evaluable data for the end point analysis. Bacopa monnieri versus placebo significantly improved verbal learning as well as delayed recall as measured by the AVLT (p&lt;.05). Though improvements were noted in the CFT, MAC-Q and TMT, there were no significant differences between placebo and active groups found for these tests. The Bacopa group reported a higher incidence of gastro-intestinal (GIT) side-effects than the placebo group, these predominantly being increased stool frequency, abdominal cramps and nausea. No other significant adverse effects were found.  Conclusions A clinical trial was carried out to assess the effects of 12-weeks administration of Bacopa monnieri (300mg/day) on memory performance in people over the age of 55-years. Primary outcome measures were well validated neuropsychological tests that objectively measured verbal and visual memory and a memory complaint questionnaire that measured subjective memory complaints.  The results demonstrated that Bacopa significantly improved memory acquisition and retention in older Australians. This concurs with findings from previous human and animal studies, as well as supports traditional Ayurvedic claims and uses. The beneficial effects on memory observed may be due to previously demonstrated antioxidant and cholinergic effects of the herb on the central nervous system.  The use of Bacopa was associated with GIT side-effects, particularly increased bowel movements, nausea and abdominal cramping, findings infrequently reported previously. Possible explanations for these side-effects include GIT irritation by the saponin constituents of the herb, or cholinergic stimulation of autonomic and motor responses in the GIT, or a combination of both of these factors. The side-effects observed in the current study provide supportive evidence that Bacopa may increase cholinergic activity in humans.  A worthwhile future extension of the current study would be to assess whether the finding of Bacopa&#8217;s efficacy for improving memory performance is replicable in populations with either mild cognitive impairment or early dementia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bacopa monnieri</field><field name="subject">Brahmi</field><field name="subject">Bacopa</field><field name="subject">memory improvement</field><field name="subject">memory performance</field><field name="subject">cognitive improvement</field><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Natural Products Chemistry and Pharmacognosy</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/59</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing unit trust performance</field><field name="creator">Tng, Cheong Sing</field><field name="description">Bank-managed equity funds are not inferior to their non-bank counterparts. Previous research reporting relative underperformance of bank-managed funds ignored their differing fiduciary standards. To evaluate bank and non-bank funds facing similar fiduciary responsibilities, domestic retail funds approved for Singapore&#8217;s Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme were examined, as they meet the same standard for managing social security savings. Returns from these funds correlate highly with market performance. Even though these fund returns exceeded guaranteed interest rates, they did not outperform their market index.With financial market deregulation in Southeast Asia, local banks in small economies withstand erosion of business by foreign competitors. Banks, in order to increase profits, compete with local as well as foreign insurance and investment companies by offering mutual fund products. To remain competitive, banks need to shed their reputation for not being able to generate impressive fund returns, as their funds are not inferior to those from insurance and investment companies in terms of assets under management, expenditures, returns and risk. To gain competitive advantage, banks can differentiate their fund characteristics and reduce portfolio management costs.Mutual fund characteristics can affect expected returns or transaction costs. Factors affecting expected returns include asset allocation and systematic risk, while transaction costs include explicit and implicit ones, which can be measured by expense ratios and size of funds respectively. Insignificance of transaction cost determinants in affecting actual returns can be attributable to dominance of factors affecting expected returns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">assets under management</field><field name="subject">bank-managed fund</field><field name="subject">expense ratio</field><field name="subject">financial institution</field><field name="subject">fund performance evaluation</field><field name="subject">mutual fund management</field><field name="subject">unit trust</field><field name="subject">Finance and Financial Management</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/44</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Best practice features and practices guiding community service organisation governance</field><field name="creator">Jones, Christopher Randall</field><field name="description">The review of the literature and the results gained from this research suggest an important link between the effectiveness of a board, including its corporate governance practices, and organisational effectiveness. This link attests to the importance of a greater focus upon the governance approach used by organisations. There is extensive literature about corporate governance in the business sector and there is emerging research into corporate governance in the Third Sector. However there is very little literature about the community service component on the Third Sector in Australia and none in relation to community service organisations that are incorporated under the Tasmanian Associations Incorporation Act 1964. This thesis aims to discover what is defined as best practice in the area of corporate governance for Tasmanian community service organisations and if selected organisations have adopted that best practice. For this purpose a research problem and three research sub-problems are identified. The research adopts a case study approach as the main research methodology using interviews, document reviews and a short self assessment questionnaire as data collection tools. The researcher approached six incorporated community service organisations funded by the Tasmanian Department of Health and Human Services and they agreed to participate in the research. Following data collection and data analysis the following major findings emerge. Firstly, that case organisations have adopted a range of governance practices. There are significant gaps in some organisations and there is room for improvement in all of the case organisations. Secondly, that some case organisation boards are approaching corporate governance by managing compliance to a minimum standard although others are offering strategic leadership with a commitment to quality and best practice. Thirdly, the research identifies a number of factors that impact upon corporate governance in case organisations. Those factors include the role of the Chief Executive Officer; the quest for competitive advantage; implementation of governance maintenance strategies and the impact of religion for religious-based organisations. Finally, the research also identifies three factors that were not determinative upon case organisations. They are the size of the organisation, the governance model being used, and the influence of the regulator (the Business Affairs Office) and the funding provider (the Department of Health and Human Services). Consequently it is concluded that the principle based approach to corporate governance can be extended to Tasmania. Furthermore the implication of this research for community sector organisations is that they need to implement governance maintenance practices including board training, board performance review and governance review. There is also a call to both the Business Affairs Office and the Department of Health and Human Services to be more proactive in requiring community service organisations to adopt additional corporate governance practices. Hence, based on the literature review and the analysis of the research data, a list of &#8220;Best practice features and practices guiding community service organisation governance&#8221; has been developed. This list can be used by organisations to provide direction for their approach to corporate governance. Finally, the conclusions provide a solid foundation for further study. This will be useful in order to obtain a broader understanding of the issues involved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">best practice</field><field name="subject">case study</field><field name="subject">community sector organisations</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Third Sector</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Management, and Operations</field><field name="subject">Health and Medical Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/26</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strange</field><field name="creator">Prussian, Denny</field><field name="description">Strange is a work of biographical fiction, memoir and critical interpretation divided into three parts: Strange Past, Strange Present and Strange Extrapolations. Strange Past introduces the author&#8217;s ancestors and explores the ways in which they negotiated cultural and location change as new settlers and, later, as mixed-race identities within the dangerously unstable colonial-racial environment of the 19C Swan-River colony. Although the names belonged to real people and the text is based on facts drawn from public records and the author&#8217;s oral family history, the actions and dialogue in Strange Past are fictional. In Strange Present the author introduces himself as memoir subject and, through his perspective as a descendant of the central Strange Past protagonists, the theme of mixed-race cultural negotiation continues within a late Twentieth-Century environment. The memoir also relies on fiction to tell the fundamentally factual stories. Strange Past and Strange Present form the body text. Strange Extrapolations is a critical interpretation of the body text structured around a research focus on cultural, textual and discursive/linguistic hybridity. Informed and supported by post-colonial, post-structural and post-modern discourse on identity and belonging within racial multiplicities, Strange Extrapolations attempts to illuminate the instability of static cultures, ideologies or notions of identity wherever hybridity exists. Indeed, Strange Extrapolations infers that hybridity exists everywhere in an infinite multitude of incarnations and thus remains as a permanently destabilising influence upon every human status quo.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English Language and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/2</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of a critical realist perspective in education</field><field name="creator">Shipway, Brad</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the implications of a critical realist perspective for the field of education. Areas of consonance and divergence between two traditions of critical realism which have previously not referenced each other are outlined. It is argued that both theological critical realism and &#8220;Bhaskarian&#8221; critical realism are consonant in terms of their base tenets, and support the concept of a postfoundational, dialectical, stratified and alethic model of truth.The implications of this model and the potential of other critical realist doctrines for education are then examined. It is argued that the combination of critical realism&#8217;s epistemological relativism and ontological realism allows it to steer a course between the extremes of other dominant positions, which are ultimately susceptible to either the foundationalism of positivism, or the regression of idealism.It is suggested that critical realism is uniquely positioned to provide an antidote to the problems besetting contemporary educational research &#8211; especially in instances where modern and postmodern influences are involved in a recalcitrant, self-sustaining conflict. The postfoundationalist doctrines of critical realism enable it to appropriate deconstructionist research methods, but deploy them from within a realist framework. The implications of a critical realist perspective also go beyond educational research, indicating a conception of education as an emancipatory enterprise. By virtue of its evolutionary, stratified model of human rationality, critical realism raises significant challenges to dominant views of pedagogy and praxis in education. Given its concern with absenting constraints upon human freedom, it is claimed that critical realism reveals the real task of education as facilitating the emergent rationality of students towards emancipation. In light of this emancipatory mission, the possible contribution of critical realism to the field of education is too significant to ignore.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical realism</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">theological critical realism</field><field name="subject">dialectical critical realism</field><field name="subject">educational research</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/103</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcultural teachers: experiences of academics teaching tourism and hospitality in multicultural and transnational contexts</field><field name="creator">Witsel, Mieke</field><field name="description">The rapid growth in internationalisation of education has led to the point where Australia has become a world leader in transnational education. Simultaneously, the provision of hospitality and tourism management education has developed rapidly from its inception in 1974 with numbers of international students rising steadily. Although robust research into the international student experience has been conducted, the impact of these changes upon tertiary academics has received little attention from researchers.  Within this context, this research project aims to develop a better understanding of academics&#8217; experiences of teaching tourism and hospitality in transcultural settings. More specifically, the study seeks to discover the impacts of working in a multicultural, multinational and multilingual environment on the tourism and hospitality academic (Objective One), and to explore the concept of competence in multicultural and transnational teaching (Objective Two). This thesis is presented in five stages. The first stage considers the formative background to the research, and explores literature and concepts surrounding transcultural contexts of higher education. The current state of internationalisation of tourism and hospitality higher education in Australia is outlined, and gaps in the research field are highlighted. This section observes a need for transcultural competence in teaching. Stage Two addresses methodological considerations and explores the use of interpretive phenomenological methodology for gaining a greater understanding of the lived experiences of academics teaching in transcultural contexts. The practice and philosophies surrounding phenomenology, interviewing, and transcribing talk are critically examined. This stage also proposes the use of mind mapping as a tool for qualitative research analysis. Employing the interpretive methodologies outlined in the previous stage, Stage Three considers Objective One by addressing the research question &#8216;What are the concerns and constraints experienced by academics teaching in transnational and multicultural contexts?&#8217; In keeping with a phenomenological approach which encourages testing initial intuitions by subjecting them to critical evaluation, this section incorporates a peer-reviewed paper written by the researcher. Findings showed that academics experienced concerns and constraints relating to their sense of self, the intercultural other (the students) and the temporal and education environment in which they are situated. Stage Three also addresses the second research question, &#8216;What influences the positive experiences of academics teaching in transnational and multicultural contexts?&#8217; Findings showed that travel and journeying (both physical and metaphorical) were highly significant, beneficial, and contributed greatly to emotional well-being as they allowed the academics to experience joy in transcultural teaching. Stage Four addresses the second research objective and incorporates two research questions. The question &#8216;How are academics&#8217; intercultural competences in multicultural education formed?&#8217; involved the theoretical delineation of the specific research area through an in-depth systematic literature review in order to develop a holistic explanatory model. The model considers epistemology and ontology of teaching practice, and contains four quadrants: self-knowledge, values, knowledge and skills. The final research question, &#8216;How do successful international tourism and hospitality educators embody and integrate competence in their teaching within multicultural and transnational classrooms?&#8217; entailed close phenomenological analysis of the narrated experiences of four academics who had not only derived much enjoyment from their transcultural teaching, but had been publicly recognised by peers and by their universities as being successful teachers. The narrated experiences, approaches and opinions of these academics are analysed and organised according to the model and are explored under the headings Epistemology &#8211; which includes &#8216;cultural knowledge&#8217; and &#8216;skills&#8217;; and Ontology, which covers &#8216;values&#8217; and &#8216;self&#8217;.  Stage Five considers the implications and significance of this research for higher education. The thesis contributes not only to research into teaching and internationalisation of education, but also makes original contributions to qualitative research methodology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">internationalisation</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">teaching</field><field name="subject">competence</field><field name="subject">tourism education</field><field name="subject">hospitality education</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Hospitality Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">International and Intercultural Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/80</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwife to Gaia, birthing global consciousness: a reflective topical autobiography</field><field name="creator">Myers, Estelle</field><field name="description">This Reflective Topical Autobiography (RTA) aimed to reflect on and recount my own actual life stories and the life lessons learned, in order to identify patterns, trends and insights from my life and to offer these insights to others. My objectives were to promote personal empowerment as a tool for fulfilling individual potential, and to heal and be healed, by taking personal responsibility and making choices that enhance the individual and thus the collective consciousness.The research questions I posed to myself to assist in reflecting on and recounting my life stories were: What are the key stories of my life? What life lessons have I learned from my experiences? What are the patterns, trends and insights from my life? How can I offer these insights to other people? The RTA activities included writing personal stories, reflecting on my life patterns, trends and insights, and using photographs and a DVD production, to illustrate the main ideas and events.The research process allowed me to move from being reactive to reflective and to answer the research questions. Some of my life lessons learned from my experiences are that: one person can make a difference; lack of money is not lack of personal power; and nothing is impossible. My life patterns and trends include having a high-energy lifestyle, living without fear, learning to deal with disappointments, keeping life records, taking responsibility for action, and creating a morphic field. This RTA also offers insights to other people, with whom they resonate.It became apparent to me, in the process of documenting my personal journey in this RTA, that by suspending judgement and keeping an open mind and open heart, I am able to attune to what I call &#8216;Divine Intelligence&#8217;. It is a deep cellular knowing, that we are all connected. In 32 years of my own development, I have witnessed quantum leaps in the disciplines of science, spirit, ancient wisdom and health, which are acknowledged in the academies of the world. There is a new way of seeing and thinking, which is about a future based on these holistic principles of interconnectedness. It is the contention of this RTA that thoughts and intentions are the tools for personal and global change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alternative and Complementary Medicine</field><field name="subject">Medicine and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/78</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of genetic algorithms to Visual Interactive Simulation optimisation</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Gary M</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD in Computer and Information Science)--University of South Australia, 1995</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SimView (Computer file)</field><field name="subject">Combinatorial optimization</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83971</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42486</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art education of older adults in institutional settings /</field><field name="creator">Gibbs, Michael James</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEd (Curriculum Leadership))--University of South Australia, 1997</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art and older people.</field><field name="subject">Older people</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81268</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43232</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visions of Eden :</field><field name="creator">Gibbons, Geoffrey T</field><field name="description">Thesis (MArt)--University of South Australia, 2001.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Palmer, Samuel,</field><field name="subject">Pastoral art.</field><field name="subject">Landscape in art.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/78006</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43683</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of frequency programs on customer loyalty :</field><field name="creator">Gibbins, Anchalee</field><field name="description">Most customer loyalty programs available across the service industry have largely focused on building repeat patronage.

It is exported to Japan, China, Korea and the United States for the sushi and sashimi markets. The primary purpose of SBT farming in SA is to fatten wild-caught juvenile fish (2-4 years of age with initial mean weights between 12-20 kg) over a period of approximately five months by feeding a selection of baitfish types. Farmers, farm managers and consumers of SBT all have an interest in managing chemical residues that have the potential to biomagnify in the fatty tissue of the farmed SBT fillets. Of particular interest are chemical residues of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins / dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs). This research presents the investigations and experimental validation of a predictive model that can be used to address the levels of residues in the fillets of farmed SBT at harvest from feeding (as the source) when applied to SBT aquaculture. An additional industry-focussed aim of this research was to determine if a Longer Term Holding (LTH) farming period, with a duration of an extra 12 months after a typical farming period of approximately five months, could produce SBT with higher condition index (CI) and lipid content, while keeping levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs low, compared to the typical farming period. The justification for this research is that an adequate quantitative model is essential to help industry achieve targeted concentrations in the final fillet product by making scientific-based decisions on baitfish selection (baitfish strategies for the feeding of SBT), and longer term, to confidently demonstrate to local markets and importing countries that Australia is actively managing levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in farmed SBT, to ensure a high quality and safe product is delivered to the consumer. The novelty of this research is underpinned by four integrated stages, and the criteria for an adequate model established. The important criteria included: accurate predictions versus observed data demonstrated through the analysis of residual plots, potential physiological interpretation of model coefficients, parsimony &#8211; the model should be as simple as possible (but no simpler) and that the model should be easy to use. Firstly, a logical starting point was the development of a risk framework for residues in SBT. The developed framework was based on conventional principles of microbiological risk assessment highlighted in Codex Alimentarius. The risk framework consists of five governing principles: hazard identification, hazard characterisation, exposure assessment, risk characterisation and model validation. The advantages of the risk framework is that it provides a systematic research approach and permits information to be handled unambiguously, especially important for the niche SBT industry where chemical residue research is carried out for the first time. Secondly, because of a lack of available scientific data in context of this research, commercial-scale experimental field data for levels of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in typical farmed SBT as affected by feeding and growth were collected over 17 months at seven time intervals from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd in 2005/06 (n = 50). Field data from another commercial company, Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd, was collected over the typical farming period specific to this company, spanning 15 weeks at three time intervals in 2006, for validation work (n = 15). The data obtained from Farm Delta Fishing Pty Ltd revealed that whole weight of farmed SBT increased from 18.5 kg to 30.3 kg for a typical farming period, and subsequently to 41.0 kg by the end of the LTH farming period. A maximum mean CI of 24.0 &#177; 0.5 kg.m&#8315;&#179; and a maximum mean lipid content of 17.6 &#177; 0.5% was achieved at the third time interval of the typical farming period, for the baitfish types and ratios used as feed. There were no significant differences in the CI and lipid between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods, i.e. even after an additional 12 months of farming. PCB and PCDD/F concentrations, however, increased between the final harvests of the typical farming and LTH periods. The data indicated that a typical farming period was sufficient to achieve a maximum CI and lipid content with lower concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in the fillets relative to the LTH farming period. For the third stage of this research, a quantitative model was synthesised and applied to the PCB and PCDD/F (2,3,7,8-TeCDF) data detected in farmed SBT fillets. Assimilation efficiencies for PCBs and 2,3,7,8-TeCDF in the fillets of SBT were obtained. An assimilation efficiency, or percentage retention (efficiency expressed as a percentage), in the fillet of SBT is a measure of the uptake of a chemical residue from food (baitfish) to the SBT fillet. For the WHO-PCBs, assimilation efficiencies based on SBT fillets ranged between 19.1 &#8211; 35.3 % with the exception of PCB 169. The highest assimilation efficiency of 35.3 %, with a range of 30.4 &#8211; 40.3 % (at the 95 % confidence level) was attributed to the most toxic PCB congener, PCB 126. An assimilation efficiency of 39.2 % was determined in SBT fillets for the congener 2,3,7,8-TeCDF, which was higher than the assimilation efficiencies determined for the WHO-PCB congeners. A residual plot as predicted value versus observed value indicated that the predictive model was neither under- or over-parameterised. However, when the predictive model was assessed against the data set from Farm Alpha Pty Ltd, the model over-predicted the actual PCB and PCDD/F concentrations. The over-prediction is attributed to possible overfeeding of SBT farmed by Farm Alpha Fishing Pty Ltd. From a food safety point of view, in the absence of ideal predictions because of a lack of ideal validation data sets, an over-prediction instead of under-prediction is preferred. In the fourth stage, the practical application of the predictive model was demonstrated. Because SBT fillets are retailed as tissue group-specific, i.e. akami (low fat), chu-toro (medium fat) and otoro (high fat) fillets, PCB and PCDD/F analyses were carried out on the three tissue groups for selected SBT (n = 7). Dietary modelling on SBT consumption in humans was carried out using findings from the predictive model and tissue-specific data. The baitfish strategy employed for the feeding of farmed SBT consequently affects dietary exposure to SBT consumers. Exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is approximately seven times lower for the consumption of a skin-free, boneless akami fillet than for a comparable otoro fillet of the same size. This dietary exposure assessment accounted only for consumption of SBT tissue-specific fillets. The experimental field study and modelling work on PCB and PCDD/F concentrations in farmed SBT (fillets) outlined in this thesis importantly directs the need to re-evaluate a specific model to better cater for SBT farming practices where SBT fillets are produced for human consumption. Because conditions that normally pertain to commercial farming of wild-caught fish were studied, findings should be of interest to industries where other species of fish (for food) are farmed in sea-cages in the open ocean.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemical residues; fish; Southern Bluefin Tuna; predictive modelling; PCBs; PCDD/Fs; bipheyls; dioxins; biomagnification model</field><field name="subject">Bluefin tuna Australia</field><field name="subject">Bluefin tuna fisheries Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58572</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molybdenum transport in plants.</field><field name="creator">Fitzpatrick, Kate Louise</field><field name="description">Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential micronutrient required by plants. It is biologically inactive until bound in a pterin compound named the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) that binds to apoproteins used in both reductive and oxidative reactions such as nitrate reductase (NR), xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), aldehyde oxidase (AO) and sulfite oxidase (SOX). In Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot, molybdenum deficiency is common amongst vines grown on own roots in acidic soils often resulting in yield reductions. Foliar application of molybdenum sprays increases yield and remedies deficiency indicating that Merlot grown on own roots has a reduced capacity for molybdenum uptake from the soil. Molybdenum generally occurs as molybdate (MoO&#8324;  &#178;&#8315;) within the soil solution. The mechanism(s) involved in molybdenum transport have recently been discovered in plants, although are well characterised within prokaryotic systems. Unfortunately, no homologues of prokaryotic genes involved in molybdate transport exist within eukaryotes. It has been suggested that molybdenum transport in plants may occur through other systems including sulfate transporters due to chemical similarities between sulfate and molybdate. A yeast functional complementation approach using a sulfate transport mutant was initially used to identify novel putative plant molybdenum transport proteins. A cDNA library derived from Pinot noir roots starved of molybdenum was screened for transporters. Unfortunately, no cDNAs were identified that met the requirements of a molybdenum transporter when screened on media containing low amounts of molybdenum. However, a number of putative cDNA&#8217;s partially complemented the yeast mutant YSD1, however none of these could be validated in second round screens. A candidate gene approach was then initiated to identify pre-characterised genes that may also have capacity to transport molybdenum. The plant sulfate transporter, SHST1, restored growth of YSD1 on media containing low amounts of molybdenum. Kinetic analysis using &#8313;&#8313;MoO&#8324;&#178;&#8315; to trace molybdenum transport in yeast cells demonstrated that SHST1 enhanced the uptake of molybdenum at nM concentrations. The uptake was not inhibited by sulfate, but the transport of sulfate was reduced with molybdenum. Further analysis demonstrated that SHST1 did prefer sulfate as the substrate but molybdenum could compete at higher concentrations. This result is the first measurement of molybdenum being transported through a pre characterised sulfate transport protein. Whole plant experiments using rooted grapevine cuttings and &#8313;&#8313;MoO&#8324;&#178;&#8315; to trace molybdenum movement into plants indicated that Merlot did not have reduced capacity to uptake molybdenum compared to other varieties that do not suffer from molybdenum deficiencies such as Chardonnay. When plants were grown with molybdenum, Merlot accumulated more molybdenum than Chardonnay, with the reverse being true when plants were grown without molybdenum. Similar experiments were performed on symbiosomes isolated from Glycine max grown with and without molybdenum. Symbiosomes absorbed more molybdenum when plants were grown without molybdenum. A field site was established to look at the molybdenum profiles within petioles against yield responses over a 3-year period. Molybdenum application did not increase the yield amongst vines despite all vines initially being deficient in molybdenum. There were no cumulative effects of molybdenum application over the trial, however, molybdenum did have limited translocation ability within the vine system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">molybdenum transport; sulfate transport; SHST1; YSD1; grapevine; molybdenum nutrition</field><field name="subject">Molybdenum</field><field name="subject">Plants</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58573</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic analysis and manipulation of economically important traits in bread wheat.</field><field name="creator">Kuchel, Haydn</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis were to firstly gain an improved understanding of the genetic basis to economically important complex traits in bread wheat, and secondly, to investigate marker assisted selection (MAS) methodologies that may lead to improved rates of genetic gain. An elite Australian breeder's line, 'Stylet', and its parents 'Trident' and 'Molineux' were used as the basis of this study. A doubled-haploid (DH) population previously produced from a cross between 'Trident' and 'Molineux' (TIM DH) was used to dissect the genetic basis to end-use quality and agronomic performance. The study of end-use quality confirmed the widely published relationship between the glutenin loci and dough rheology. However this study also identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 2A that was shown to be associated with dough resistance and baking quality, and another QTL on 3A that was associated with baking quality. QTL were identified in the T/M DH population that were involved in the control of time to ear-emergence through their effects on vernalisation sensitivity, photoperiod sensitivity and earliness per se. In addition to the well characterised Vrn-A1 and Ppd-B1 genes, six other QTL were identified. Three of these, QPpd.agt-1A, QPpd.agt-7A and QPpd.agt-7B are putative new loci involved in the control of photoperiod sensitivity in wheat. QPpd.agt-1A appears homoeologous to the photoperiod response gene Ppd-H2 in barley. QPpd.agt-7A and QPpd.agt-7B are located in homoeologous regions, and may represent a new phenology gene series in wheat. The T/M DH population was also used to dissect the genetic basis to grain yield and grain yield components, and to examine the influence of QTL-by environmental covariable interaction on genotype-by-environment interaction. The association of plant height genes, rust resistance genes and phenology genes with grain yield were determined. Overall, semi-dwarf rust resistant DH lines, carrying alleles conferring a short time to ear-emergence, showed the highest and most stable grain yield. Nine genetic associations with grain yield, without effects on plant height, time to ear-emergence and rust resistance, were identified. Two QTL, QGyld.agt-1B and QGyld.agt-4D were shown to have large and frequent associations with grain yield. QGyld.agt-1B showed only low levels of interaction with environmental covariables and therefore constitutes a prime candidate for MAS for grain yield. The second part of this study investigated the potential role of MAS through a practical breeding strategy and by computer simulation. An 'Anneullo/2*Stylet' cross aimed at producing a rust resistant 'Stylet' derivative with improved end-use quality was used as the model for this analysis. MAS was shown to be highly effective at improving the rate of genetic gain for rust resistance and end-use quality. This was most evident when undertaken on the BC&#8321;F&#8321;  population, although MAS also improved the efficiency of the breeding programme when performed on fixed lines. Practical implementation of the MAS breeding strategy validated the results from the simulation study and produced elite lines approaching the grain yield level of 'Stylet', with resistance to leaf, stem and stripe rust, and with improved end-use quality. While the results from this study highlight the complex nature of the major economically important traits being manipulated by wheat breeders, this study also concluded that improvements in rate of genetic gain are possible through the application of MAS.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58575</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Declining water quality as a driver of changes to subtidal communities.</field><field name="creator">Gorman, Daniel</field><field name="description">This body of work examines the influence of land use on nearshore water quality, and how this can drive changes to algal and invertebrate communities along Australia's southern coastline. The overall aim of the thesis was to investigate links between increasing coastal water-column nitrogen concentrations (derived from terrestrial inputs) and the expansion of turf-forming habitats that can alter the structure and function of subtidal ecosystems. I initially tested whether human activities in coastal catchments can increase subsidies of nitrogen to open rocky coasts. I identified landscape-scale variation in the supply of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) to coastal waters adjacent to natural, agricultural and urban catchments. Compared to natural catchments, subsidies of DIN were 8 - 407 times greater in urban catchments, and 1 - 63 times greater in agricultural catchments. Subsidies of nitrogen from urban catchments were attributed to the release of sewage effluent, as delineated by &#948;&#185;  &#8309;N isotopic values of transplanted algae. Having made this link, I then assessed whether catchment-scale variation in nitrogen subsidies may predict patterns of subtidal habitat structure, particularly as related to theories of regime shifts from forested landscapes to structurally depauperate turf-forming habitats. I validated this hypothesis, demonstrating that both relative covers and patch-sizes of turfed habitat were greater where the ratio of terrestrial nitrogen inputs to ambient coastal resources was large. An important realisation was that loss of forests may be more strongly related to the size of subsidy (i.e. the relative increases in water column nitrogen concentrations along urban coasts) rather than the size of coastal populations. Together, these data link coastal development with modified land-to-sea subsidies, and indirectly support the model that ecological effects may be proportional to the disparity between donor and recipient resources. Having demonstrated a link between nitrogen subsidies and subtidal habitat change, I then investigated factors likely to initiate and maintain such shifts. My results demonstrate that nutrient elevation can alter the natural phenology of turfs, sustaining dense covers throughout periods of natural senescence (winter). Perennial turf covers are able to accumulate large volumes of sediment; a synergy can impede the winter recruitment of canopy-forming species (kelps and fucoid algae). My observations of reduced forest recovery along urban coasts serve to highlight the complex interaction between elevated nutrients, persistent turf covers and increased sediment accumulation, which can reduce the resilience of coastal ecosystems to disturbance. In recognition that regime shifts are likely to have consequences for higher trophic levels, I compared the diet of invertebrate herbivores from healthy and degraded coastlines using stable isotope analysis (&#948;&#185;&#179;C and &#948;&#185;&#8309;N). Dietary modelling showed that turfs contributed more to the diet of consumers along degraded coastlines where turfed landscapes have replaced extensive covers of macroalgal forest. Additionally, there were strong correlations between covers of turfed habitat, herbivore diet and relative densities. Changes to ambient food quality associated with regime shift may be an important aspect of nutrient-driven change along human-dominated coastlines. The final component of my thesis redressed some of the uncertainty about restoration initiatives for urban coasts by demonstrating that regime shifts are not necessarily permanent. I showed that turf removal can facilitate the recovery of degraded forests. Future restoration, therefore, is a possible outcome of polices that aim to decouple the link between nutrient inputs and recalcitrant turfed habitats that prevent forest recovery. Initiatives that reduce nutrient discharge to coastal waters (e.g., wastewater recycling) are likely to restore the resilience of nearshore marine ecosystems and promote their rehabilitation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine ecology Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58578</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An extension of the Jolly-Seber model combining two sources of capture-recapture data</field><field name="creator">Madon, B&#233;n&#233;dicte</field><field name="description">I propose a modification of the Jolly-Seber model, the two-source Jolly-Seber (TSJS) model, to estimate population size by combining two sources of capture-recapture data of the same population where there might be an unknown overlap between two datasets. This is the case with recent surveys of whales and dolphins where researchers use individual identification records from both photo-identification and DNA profiling of skin biopsy samples. This sampling configuration results in two datasets that might contain the same individuals. This new approach enables the estimation of the overlap and the calculation of the population size using capture-recapture information arising from both sampling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the properties of the present estimator. When all the assumptions are met, the estimator seems to be unbiased as long as the occasion-specific simultaneous sampling probability is above 0.2. Simulation analyses also indicate that the proposed method performs better than existing closed-population estimators when there is little heterogeneity among individuals in capture probabilities and when the average capture probability is high. Alternatives have been explored and a two-source version of model M0 has also been developed and compared to the TSJS estimator. Traditional closed-population estimators have been compared to the new approaches (TSJS and two-source M0 models) when the population is open and the assumption of homogeneous capture probability is violated. Both procedures are finally applied to real data on the humpback whale Megaptera novaeangliae, on the wintering grounds of New Caledonia (South Pacific), where individuals have been sampled independently by skin sampling biopsy and photo-identification or simultaneously by both methods on a same capture occasion. The proposed methods hold great promise in monitoring by providing researchers and managers with a method allowing a diversity of sampling protocols. It could be more efficient in estimating population size, in terms of both precision and bias, than models based only on one type of data. And as it is important to control variation in a sampling design, this methodology could also provide a useful way to reduce variation by increasing the sample size and, hence, to enhance the estimator precision.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5631</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record.

I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storytelling memories : a tangible connection to bomber command veterans : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Marriott, Tanya</field><field name="description">As we pass the 6oth anniversary of the end of World War Two (WW2) historians are diligently collecting the memoirs of veterans to preserve for future generations. Public archives of memorabilia, letters, photos and artefacts, in the process of digitisation are complimenting the stone memorials of the past. This material culture of memory discusses human interaction. &#8220;The poor, the rich, the brave and the afraid, the hero and the deserter&#8221; (Moriarty, 1999, p 654). In contemporary museum culture this digitised information is presented in either web-based systems, or interactive kiosks. However, this approach to packaging memories and historical data often leaves out much of the depth of the topic information, skimming the surface of the knowledge conveyed. New solutions to memory and artefact display have been developed effectively in the Churchill room&#8217;s exhibit designed by Small Design (Kabat,2008) and Memory Miner (Memory Miner, 2008), a home-based memory archive programme by John Fox. Both convey the memories and artefacts upon a mapped interface, using our desire to discover and connect with memories to navigate the narrative in a self-guided format. The Storytelling Memories project seeks to build on current research to formulate an interactive platform of memory immersion and experience within a museum environment. The project utilises a touch sensitive surface as an interface between the viewer and the memories. A physical controller, when placed near the interface surface will &#8220;unlock&#8221; contained memories, enabling an open-ended storytelling experience. The design encourages the user to interact directly with the memories to create their own dialogue, with the intention of developing a more emotive, personal connection to the Veteran.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">World War Two</field><field name="subject">museum exhibit design</field><field name="subject">war veterans</field><field name="subject">interactive platform</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1045</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and the follow-through experience in three year Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. &#8216;Placements with women, not institutions&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Gray, Joanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Background This research explored the follow-through experience in three year, pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. The follow-through experience involves midwifery students following women on their journey through pregnancy, labour and birth and into the early parenting period. The concept was introduced to midwifery education in Australia in 2001 when it was embedded in the foundational Australian College of Midwives. National Education Standards for Bachelor of Midwifery programs. The inclusion of the follow-through experience in Bachelor of Midwifery education programs was a deliberate strategy to ensure midwifery students would experience midwifery continuity of care. Aims The aims of this research were to: explore the follow-through experience in order to better understand its impact on students, midwifery education providers and midwives, and, to identify the learning that is associated with this experience. Setting This research was conducted in Australia. Students from all three-year pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs were invited to participate. Design A qualitative study was undertaken. In-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders who had been involved in the development and implementation of the follow-through experience. Data were collected from former and current Bachelor of Midwifery students through an online survey and telephone interviews. A thematic analysis was undertaken and situated learning and constructivist theories were used to identify whether learning occurred in the context of the follow-through experience. Results The findings provided a unique insight into the follow-through experience from the perception of students and stakeholders. This research established that students do learn from their engagement in this experience. This learning was characterised by the primacy of the relationship with the women. Students also identified the challenges they faced in undertaking these experiences, including problems with recruitment and time commitment. Difficulties were identified around requirements of the follow-through experience, the lack of support at times for students, and the lack of congruence with the existing Australian maternity system. These difficulties were identified as having a significant impact on the students. ability to engage in, and to maximise their learning from, this experience. A conceptual model was developed to provide a synthesis of the results of this research and a framework for effective implementation and management of the follow-through experience. Implications This research has implications for midwifery education, particularly in Australia but also internationally. This experience does indeed provide unique learning opportunities for students. It is however essential that the student is given adequate support to aid their learning and to ensure they gain the most from these experiences. Conclusions The follow-through experience is an innovative education strategy and this research identified that learning occurred within this experience. This learning was identified as being situated in the context of students being placed with women. This research clearly identifies the value of the follow-through experience as an important component of student learning.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery students.</field><field name="subject">Midwifery education.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1081</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Countertrade and the internationalisation of the Australian firm.</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Richard</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to broaden our understanding of the nature, causes and consquences of countertrade in the context of the internationalisation of the firm. A comprehensive review and assessment of previous research is presented, including a discussion of how countertrade fits within the context of the various models of the internationalisation process. An analytical framework is presented for studying a number of dimensions of internationalisation (viz forms of international behaviour and international orientation) and possible causes and effects. The forms of internatioalisation invole outward, inward linked forms (such as countertrade).  Based on the literature relating to internationalisation, a number of hypotheses are developed relating various management and firms' characteristics to predisposition to countertrade. These were tested using both bi-variate and multi-variate techniques which involved the use of data generated from a nationwide sample of Australian manufacturing firms. Generally the results of the bi-variate analysis supported the hypothesis showing that the factors which predict outward driven internationalisation also tend to predict countertrade. The analysis involved three measures of internationalisation and four measures of countertrade.   Firms were then grouped according to various measures of predisposition towards countertrade. Using discriminant analysis, these groups of firms were profiled according to factors found to predict countertrade in the bivariate analysis. In order to further explore the relationship between internationalisation and countertrade, firms were also grouped according to their degree of internationalisation and strength of their predisposition towards countertrade. Firms in each group were then profiled using bi-variate and multi-variate analysis. These profiles provide potentially useful classifications of firms as possible bases for targeting and designing government assistance programs.  Finally, three case studies of countertrade transactions by Australian firms were undertaken using the network approach which facilitates a deeper understanding of countertrade in the context of internationalisation. In each case the networks of relationships involved were analysed at both inception and maturity, to further explore how countertrade influenced the internationalisation of the Australian firm. It was found that although the transactions would not have occurred without countertrade, in all cases countertrade led to further international business which in some instances did not require countertrade.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Countertrade.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Commerce.</field><field name="subject">Internationalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1083</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">J.A.

S.</field><field name="description">This study explores the moderating variables that influence a student's decisions to enter into a hospitality management programme and subsequently pursue a career in the hospitality industry. It also examines how these factors are implicated in or modify a student's career commitment over time.  The sample includes students enrolling in various three year (6 semester) diploma and undergraduate programme offered by Malaysian hospitality institutions of higher learning over the academic years of 2002- 2003. This includes four public or government funded institutions with several branch campuses, and six private institutions. Predominantly the data for this study based are on self completion questionnaires with some additional insight particularly about respondents' direction of industry employment provided by means of qualitative responses. The initial comparisons are made between students in the public and private institutions and these are followed by an extensive series of analyses examining the differences and similarities of respondents' rating in the two rounds of data collection with reference to a range of independent variables. Also reported are how these ratings change over time.  Significant differences were found in terms of parental socio-economic background between students who enrolled in the private and those in the public hospitality institutions. Nevertheless, for the key issues as to whether parental backgrounds lead to differences in respondents' attitudes and values about a career in hospitality this was not seen as an influencing determinant for both institutions. Further, the independent variables of gender, ethnicity, religion and geographical upbringing, secondary school background and prior experience do not clearly show causation of how students reports their views about the dimensions investigated in this study. In fact, students' levels of intention and commitment towards career are apparently not directly related to these independent variables.  However, despite no clear pre-tertiary education indicators of likely disaffection being identified, a very clear picture emerged in this study that there is a declining sentiment among Malaysian hospitality students towards employment in the hospitality industry and reduced intention to pursue such a career. These weakened employment intentions are formed during the educational programme and are probably at least partially a result of the maturation process with varying consequences and implications for the students, hospitality institutions, industry and the government.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hospitality</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">career choice</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">moderating variables</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1577</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing the effect of in planta RNA silencing on Plasmodiophora brassicae infection</field><field name="creator">Bulman, S. R.</field><field name="description">In the late 1990s, a series of landmark publications described RNA interference (RNAi) and related RNA silencing phenomena in nematodes, plants and fungi. By manipulating RNA silencing, biologists have been able to create tools for specifically inactivating genes. In organisms from trypanosomes to insects, RNA silencing is now indispensible for studying gene function. RNA silencing has been used in a project aimed at systematically knocking out all genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  RNA silencing has a natural role in defending eukaryotic cells against virus replication. By assembling virus DNA sequences in a form that triggers RNA silencing, biologists have created plants resistant to specific viruses. In this study, we set out to test if a similar approach would protect plants against infection by the agriculturally important Brassica pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae. P. brassicae is an obligate intracellular biotroph, from the little studied eukaryotic supergroup, the Rhizaria.  To identify the gene sequences that would be starting material for P. brassicae RNA silencing, new P. brassicae genes were gathered by cDNA cloning or genomic PCR-walking. Using suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) and oligo-capping cloning of full-length cDNAs, 76 new gene sequences were identified. A large proportion of the cDNAs were predicted to contain signal peptides for ER translocation.  In addition to the new cDNA identified here, partial sequences for the P. brassicae actin and TPS genes were published by other researchers close to the beginning of this study. Using PCR-walking, full-length genomic DNA sequences from both genes were obtained. Later, genomic DNA sequences spanning or flanking a total of 24 P. brassicae genes were obtained. The P. brassicae genes were rich in typical eukaryotic spliceosomal introns. Transcription of P. brassicae genes also appears likely to begin from initiator elements rather than TATA-box-containing promoters.  A segment of the P. brassicae actin gene was assembled in hairpin format and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. Observation of simultaneous knockdown of the GUS marker gene as well as detection of siRNAs indicated that the hpRNA sequences induced RNA silencing. However, inoculation of these plants with P. brassicae resulted in heavy club root infection. We were unable to detect decreases in actin gene expression in the infecting P. brassicae, at either early or late stages of infection. We conclude that, within the limits of the techniques used here, there is no evidence for induction of RNA silencing in P. brassicae by in planta produced siRNAs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasmodiophora brassicae</field><field name="subject">club root</field><field name="subject">Rhizaria</field><field name="subject">RNA interference</field><field name="subject">in planta RNA silencing</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="subject">suppression subtractive hybridisation</field><field name="subject">cDNA cloning</field><field name="subject">genome</field><field name="subject">intron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1856</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluxes of carbon and water in a Pinus radiata plantation and a clear-cut, subject to soil water deficit</field><field name="creator">Arneth, Almut</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the abiotic control of carbon (C) and water vapour fluxes (FCO&#8322; and E, respectively) in a New Zealand Pinus radiata D. Don plantation and a nearby clearcut. It concentrates on the limitation of these fluxes imposed by growing season soil water deficit. This results from low precipitation (658 mm a&#8315;&#185;) in combination with a limited root zone water storage capacity of the very stony soil (&gt; 30% by volume).  The thesis analyses results from seven eddy covariance flux measurement campaigns between November 1994 and March 1996. The study site was located in Balmoral Forest, 100 km north-west of Christchurch (42&#176; 52' S, 172&#176; 45' E), in a (in November 1994) 8-year-old stand. One set of measurements was conducted in an adjacent clearcut. Ecosystem flux measurements were accompanied by separate measurements of ground fluxes and of the associated environmental variables. Flux analysis focussed on the underlying processes of assimilation (Ac), canopy stomatal conductance (Gc) and respiration (Reco), using biophysical models coupled to soil water balance and temperature subroutines. Aiming to link time inegrated net ecosystem C (NEP) to tree growth, sequestration in tree biomass (NPP) was quantified by regular measurements of stem diameter using allometric relationships.  Average rates of FCO&#8322; and E were highest in spring (324 mmol m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185; and 207 mol m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;, respectively) when the abiotic environment was most favourable for Gc and Ac. During summer, fluxes were impeded by the depletion of available soil water (&#952;) and the co-occurrence of high air saturation deficit (D) and temperature (T) and were equal or smaller than during winter (FCO&#8322; = 46 mmol m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185; in summer and 115 mmol m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185; in winter; E = 57 and 47 mol m&#8315;&#178; d&#8315;&#185;, respectively). With increasingly dry soil, fluxes and their associated ratios became predominantly regulated by D rather than quantum irradiance, and on particularly hot days the ecosystem was a net C source.  Interannually, forest C and water fluxes increased strongly with rainfall, and the simultaneously reduced D and T. For two succeeding years, the second having 3 % more rain, modelled NEP was 515 and 716 g C m&#8315;&#178; a&#8315;&#185;, Ac 1690 and 1841 g C m&#8315;&#178; a&#8315;&#185; and Reco 1175 and 1125 g C m&#8315;&#178; a&#8315;&#185;. NEP / E increased in wetter (and cooler) years (1.3 and 1.5 g kg&#8315;&#185;), reflecting a relatively larger gain in NEP. Responding mainly to increased rainfall during commonly dry parts of the year (ie summer), and reflecting the otherwise benign maritime climate of New Zealand, NEP during the winter months could exceed NEP during the middle of the notional tree growing season.  Annual Ac, NEP, and NPP were strongly linearly related. This relation did not hold during bi-weekly periods when the processes of intermediate C storage were influential. Separate knowledge of tree growth and C fluxes allowed quantification of autotrophic, and heterotrophic respiration (Rhet&#8776; 0.4 NEP), as well as fine-root turnover (&#8776;0.2 NEP). The ratio of NEP and stem volume growth was conservative (0.24 t C m&#8315;&#179;) and allows a direct connection to be made between ecosystem carbon fluxes and forest yield tables.  In the absence of living roots, the clearcut flux measurements demonstrated the expected limitation of Rhet by soil temperature (Ts) and &#952;. However, an additional 'pumping effect' was discovered at the open site whereby turbulence increased CO&#8322; efflux considerably when the soil surface was wet.  Accounting for the combined effects of Ts, &#952; and turbulence, annual Rhet at the clear-cut site (loss to the atmosphere) was &#187;50 % of NEP (C sequestered from the atmosphere) in the nearby forest. Clearly, there is an important contribution of C fluxes during early stages of ecosystem development to the total C sequestered over the lifetime of a plantation.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">canopy assimilation</field><field name="subject">canopy conductance</field><field name="subject">surface conductance</field><field name="subject">soil respiration</field><field name="subject">ecosystem respiration</field><field name="subject">carbon sequestration</field><field name="subject">root growth</field><field name="subject">soil water balance</field><field name="subject">eddy covariance</field><field name="subject">interannual variability</field><field name="subject">net-primary productivity</field><field name="subject">net-ecosystem productivity</field><field name="subject">0503 - Soil Sciences</field><field name="subject">050301 - Carbon Sequestration Science</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1955</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tertiary source rocks, coals and reservoir potential in the Asem Asem and Barito Basins, Southeastern Kalimantan, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Panggabean, Hermes</field><field name="description">The Asem Asem and Barito Basins, in southeastern Kalimantan, are likely areas for coal exploitation and have good potential for hydrocarbon accumulation. Therefore, an understanding of the development of the basins, the coal and source rock potential within the sedimentary sequence, together with the physical properties of the rocks I will provide valuable information for the economic assessment and development of the region. Rifting occurred on the southeastern margin of the Sundaland continent during the Late Paleocene-Early Eocene. This formed a large, initially contiguous basin, comprising the Barito, Asem Asem and Kutei Basins, in the southeast and east Kalimantan areas. The Meratus Uplift commenced in Late Miocene and continued during the Plio-Pleistocene causing the subdivision of the large basin into the present Barito, Asem Asem and Kutei Basins. The Barito and Asem Asem Basins were filled with Tertiary and Quaternary sedimentary sequences. Deposition of the Tangung Formation commenced in the Eocene from a meandering river system which gave way to a fluvial-dominated delta and shallow marine systems. The Tanjung Formation was succeeded by the peak of the Late Eocene transgressive phase, represented by the carbonate-dominated facies of the Berai Formation. The overlying unit is the regressive lower delta plain and fluviatile succession of the Miocene Warukin Formation. The sequence ends with the Plio-Pleistocene Dahor Formation which unconformably covers the earlier units. Both the Tanjung and Warukin Formations have abundant sandstone units which consist largely of quartzarenite and sublitharenite, whilst feldspathic litharenite and subarkose are minor constituents. The Berai Formation is composed mainly of wackestone, packstone and grainstone with subordinate carbonate mudstone. The Dahor Formation is composed of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone and mudstone. The clastic rocks of the Tanjung and Warukin Formations were transported southwards from a recycled orogen source, which probably included the Kuching High, part of the Mangkalihat Ridge and the Sundaland continent or Schwaner Block. Organic petrology shows that vitrinite and liptinite are the dominant macerals within both fine-grained clastic rocks and coal in the Tanjung, Warukin and Dahor Formations. Inertinite is a minor maceral in these units, but it is slightly more prominent in the Berai Formation. The Eocene and Miocene coals do not differ greatly in terms of maceral group composition. However, the Eocene coal contains more liptinite than the Miocene coal. The rank of the Eocene coal ranges between sub-bituminous and where the average vitrinite reflectance (Rvmax) is 0.43%. The Miocene coal contains less mineral matter than the Eocene coal. Mineral matter comprises mainly kaolinite, quartz, pyrite, carbonate and small amounts of chlorite. Both the Tanjung and Warukin Formations have very good hydrocarbon generation potential. The Berai Formation has less significant source potential as this unit contains little organic matter. The vitrinite reflectance data indicates that the onset of oil generation occurs below 1600 m depth throughout both basins. In most parts of the basins the Tanjung Formation entered the oil window zone during the Miocene. In the deeper parts of the basins the Berai Formation and, locally, the lower and middle parts of the Warukin Formation also lie within the oil window. The oil generation zone does not extend up into the Dahor Formation. The results of maturation modelling and burial history indicate that relatively rapid, early coalification of the section of Eocene age occurred over most of both the Asem Asem and Barito Basins. A second, more rapid, phase of coalification affected the lower part of the Miocene succession. A late Miocene-Pliocene history of constant or falling temperature resulted in a lowered thermal drive for maturation and migration. Microscopic features indicating hydrocarbon generation occur in many samples from the Tanjung and Warukin Formations, but they are most prominent within coal samples. These features comprise migrabitumen, oil droplets, oil cuts, oil haze and dead oil. Organic geochemical analyses show that the Warukin Formation has produced some oil in the Barito Basin. A minor quantity of oil from the Tanjung Formation may have migrated into reservoir rocks in the Warukin Formation. The study proved that the oil is mainly of terrestrial higher plant origin. Sandstone beds in the Tanjung and Warukin Formations have good to very good potential as petroleum reservoir rocks. The Berai Formation is considered to be marginally favourable as a reservoir rock for hydrocarbon accumulation. Diagenetic regimes (eodiagenesis and mesodiagenesis) have controlled the enhancement of secondary porosity after reducing primary porosity within the reservoir rocks. The most economically viable areas for coal are on the eastern flank of the Senakin Peninsula, and in the Kintap, Bunati and Gunung Kukusan areas. For petroleum exploration, the eastern and southern Barito Basin, and south of Pulau Laut and the A-1 and A-2 wells in the Asem Asem Basin, probably have the highest potential for hydrocarbon discovery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/2113</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Novel hydrogels for protein drug delivery</field><field name="creator">Mawad, Damia, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Embolic agents are used to block blood flow of hypervascular tumours, ultimately resulting in target tissue necrosis. However, this therapy is limited by the formation of new blood vessels within the tumour, a process known as angiogenesis. Targeting angiogenesis led to the discovery of anti-angiogenic factors, large molecular weight proteins that can block the angiogenic process. The aim of this research is development of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) aqueous solutions that cross-link in situ to form a hydrogel that functions as an embolic agent for delivery of macromolecular drugs. Methods: PVA (14 kDa, 83% hydrolysed), functionalised by 7 acrylamide groups per chain, was used to prepare 10, 15, and 20wt% non-degradable hydrogels, cured by UV or redox initiation. Structural properties were characterised and the release of FITCDextran (20kDa) was quantified. Degradable networks were then prepared by attaching to PVA (83% and 98 % hydrolysed) ester linkages with an acrylate end group. The effect on degradation profiles was assessed by varying parameters such as macromer concentration, cross-linking density, polymer backbone and curing method. To further enhance the technology, radiopaque degradable PVA was synthesised, and degradation profiles were determined. Cell growth inhibition of modified PVA and degradable products were also investigated. Results: Redox initiation resulted in non-degradable PVA networks of well-controlled structural properties. Increasing the solid content from 10 to 20wt% prolonged the release time from few hours to ~ 2 days but had no effect on the percent release, with only a maximum release of 65% achieved. Ester attachment to the PVA allowed flexibility in designing networks of variable swelling behaviors and degradation times allowing ease of tailoring for specific clinical requirements. Synthesis of radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels was successful without affecting the polymer solubility in water or its ability to polymerize by redox. This suggested that this novel hydrogel is a potential liquid embolic with enhanced X-ray visibility. Degradable products had negligible cytotoxicity.  Conclusion: Novel non-degradable and radiopaque degradable PVA hydrogels cured by redox initiation were developed in this research. The developed PVA hydrogels showed characteristics in vitro that are desirable for the in vivo application as release systems for anti-angiogenic factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug delivery systems</field><field name="subject">Drug targeting</field><field name="subject">Polymers in medicine</field><field name="subject">Drugs - Controlled release</field><field name="subject">Polymeric drug delivery systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25221</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Was the Tooth Fairy breast fed? The politics of infant tooth decay</field><field name="creator">Luxford, Yvonne, School of History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the mid 1970s American paediatric dentists started publishing claims that breast feeding an infant on demand and/or during the night was as dangerous to the infant's dental health, in terms of the production of caries, as the previously established dangers of Baby Bottle Tooth Decay. It was argued by some dentists that this danger increased if the infant was breast fed for an extended period of time. Such claims have gained support from many dentists, and their professional bodies, into the twenty-first century. This thesis examines the historical, social, commercial and cultural influences that supported the development of such assertions. It analyses the ways in which expert reinforcement was gained, and scrutinises the scientific controversy as publicly fought in professional journals and other outlets. The thesis also examines the growing status of the dental profession, especially in connection with its claim to specialised scientific and medical knowledge in the production of dental caries. Further, consideration is given to the medicalisation of breast feeding and the associated commercial infant feeding dispute. The thesis attempts to redress the current lack of theoretical analysis of the construction of dental knowledge. To date there has been minimal academic contribution to the history of dentistry; however, the absence of extensive analysis has been advantageous in enabling an original approach to the material.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breastfeeding.</field><field name="subject">Dental caries in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25224</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereotype threat behind the wheel</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Nai Chi, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Stereotype threat refers to the pressure that individuals feel when they are at risk of confirming a demeaning stereotype about themselves. Research has found that stereotype threat impairs performance on cognitive-based tasks by inducing mental interference (e.g., Schmader &amp; Johns, 2003). This thesis hypothesised that this finding would generalise to driving and that drivers who are better able to inhibit cognitive interference (i.e., with better inhibitory ability) would be less susceptible to the disruptive effect of stereotype threat than drivers who are less able (i.e., with poorer inhibitory ability). A series of three experiments conducted in a driving simulator tested the predictions using the gender stereotype of driving skills and investigated the interpretation of the results. The experiments revealed that stereotype threat exerted both a facilitative and debilitative influence on driving performance, as indicated by different performance measures. The facilitative effect diminished when drivers experienced increased mental demands or when they were assessed by an unexpected performance measure, while the debilitative effect was more likely observed among drivers who received negative feedback than drivers who received positive feedback. Moreover, the results supported the prediction that inhibitory ability would moderate the detrimental impact of stereotype threat as the performance of drivers with poorer inhibitory ability was impeded more than that of drivers with better inhibitory ability. Regarding the processes underlying the present findings, the experiments provided suggestive evidence that stereotype threat elicits cognitive interference and simultaneously motivates drivers to concentrate on particular performance areas in an attempt to refute the stereotype. In combination, these processes appear to be at least partly responsible for the performance deficits and boosts observed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stereotype (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stereotypes (Social psychology)</field><field name="subject">Bahavior modification</field><field name="subject">Automobile driving - Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Performance - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26242</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strength and ductility of high-strength concrete shear walls under reversed cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Dabbagh, Hooshang, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study concerns the strength and behaviour of low-rise shear walls made from high-strength concrete under reversed cyclic loading. The response of such walls is often strongly governed by the shear effects leading to the shear induced or brittle failure. The brittle nature of high-strength concrete poses further difficulties in obtaining ductile response from shear walls. An experimental program consisting of six high-strength concrete shear walls was carried out. Specimens were tested under inplane axial load and reversed cyclic displacements with the test parameters investigated being longitudinal reinforcement ratio, transverse reinforcement ratio and axial load. Lateral loads, lateral displacements and the strains of reinforcement in edge elements and web wall were measured. The test results showed the presence of axial load has a significant effect on the strength and ductility of the shear walls. The axially loaded wall specimens exhibited a brittle behaviour regardless of reinforcement ratio whereas the specimen with no axial load had a lower strength but higher ductility. It was also found that an increase in the longitudinal reinforcement ratio gave an increase in the failure load while an increase in the transverse reinforcement ratio had no significant effect on the strength but influenced the failure mode. A non-linear finite element program based on the crack membrane model and using smeared-fixed crack approach was developed with a new aggregate interlock model incorporated into the finite element procedure. The finite element model was corroborated by experimental results of shear panels and walls. The finite element analysis of shear wall specimens indicated that while strengths can be predicted reasonably, the stiffness of edge elements has a significant effect on the deformational results for two-dimensional analyses. Therefore, to capture the deformation of walls accurately, three-dimensional finite element analyses are required. The shear wall design provisions given in the current Australian Standard and the Building Code of American Concrete Institute were compared with the experimental results. The comparison showed that the calculated strengths based on the codes are considerably conservative, specially when there exists the axial load.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Concrete walls -- Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27467</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spontaneous recovery in Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition</field><field name="creator">Leung, Hiu Tin, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in the present thesis examined the behavioural processes of Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition. The first series of experiments studied the reacquisition of extinguished fear responses following different amounts of extinction training. Rapid reacquisition occurred when rats were reconditioned after moderate extinction, showing that the original learning remained intact across this extinction. In contrast, when reconditioning was given after massive extinction, reconditioned responding was first depressed but then spontaneously recovered over time. This suggests that massive extinction produces a relatively permanent loss of the originally learned responding, while additionally imposes on the extinguished CS a transient latent inhibitory process that prevented the immediate but not the delayed expression of reconditioning.  The second series of experiments studied the impact of spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear responses on their additional extinction. These experiments demonstrated that a CS that had time to show spontaneous recovery underwent greater response loss across additional extinction than one lacking recovery. They also showed that an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS showing recovery suffered greater response loss than an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS lacking recovery. Further, extinction of a compound composed of two CSs, one showing recovery and a second lacking recovery, produced greater extinction to the CS that showed recovery. These results show that spontaneous recovery of extinguished responses deepens their extinction through an error-correction mechanism regulated by both common and individual error terms.  The third series of experiments studied the spontaneous recovery of latently inhibited and extinguished fear responses in within-subject designs. Using a compound test procedure, a CS that had received extensive preexposure or extensive extinction was found to have undergone greater spontaneous recovery relative to a CS just moderately preexposed or moderately extinguished. A CS given a mixed history of preexposure and extinction also underwent greater recovery relative to a CS just preexposed or just extinguished. These results suggest that both latent inhibition and extinction share a transient depressive process, and that the resulting recovery of responding is proportional to the amount of this depression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spontaneous recovery</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">latent inhibition</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">conditioning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43701</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the demagnetisation process and possible alternative magnetic treatments for naval vessels</field><field name="creator">Baynes, Timothy Malcolm, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naval submarines and surface ships are regularly subjected to a treatment called &amp;quotdeperming&amp;quot that seeks to design the vessel???s permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate various aspects of the deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A &amp;quotlaboratory MTF&amp;quot was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU200T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ??5%) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU200T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ??0.1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0.94 ??0.09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA2S-E and CU200T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU200T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5.97??10-3 and 0.0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D): redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel &amp;quotanhysteretic deperm&amp;quot method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin???s equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. &amp;quotSympathetic deperming&amp;quot occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (&amp;gt 0.1m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0.5mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Degaussing</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic devices</field><field name="subject">Magnetism of ships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20479</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composing women and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century in England, France and Germany</field><field name="creator">Harris, Amanda Jane, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The turn from the nineteenth century into the twentieth saw an increase in the number of composing European women attaining prominence in the music world. This period of history is also now recognised as one of the key phases of the first wave of feminism. Feminists and musical women moved in a similar stratum of society. Although women of this era have increasingly been the subject of scholarly research, music historians have rarely investigated the links between the turn of the century??s wave of composing women and feminists.  This dissertation uses the feminist and musical press as a means to investigate composing women??s engagement with feminism. I examine feminists?? regard for women musicians and conversely composing women??s views on feminism. The thesis also reframes the privatelives of composing women through an analysis of primary sources. The composers who form the focus of this biographical investigation include Lili Boulanger (1893-1918), Ethel Smyth (1858-1944), Luise Adolpha Le Beau (1850-1927), Louise H??ritte-Viardot (1841-1918) and Armande de Polignac (1876-1962). Using a large body of newly analysed, unpublished correspondence and private papers, this research offers fresh insights into the biographies of composing women as well as their own self-portrayal, revealing the complex nature of Ethel Smyth??s sexuality and reassessing the fatalistic portrait of Lili Boulanger which has been drawn in some previous studies. These biographical insights background the contentions of the thesis that composing women and feminists shared common ground.  Through investigating the presence of musicians in the feminist press and of feminism in the musical press, the thesis reveals an ambivalent relationship between feminists and musicians. The disappointed expectations of feminists are contrasted with the reasons composing women had for retaining a distance from feminism. The exploration of composing women??s political and personal context enables an understanding not only of their contribution to music history, but also of their place within the greater history of women??s development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">Wwomen</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Twentieth century</field><field name="subject">Composers</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">Smyth</field><field name="subject">Boulanger</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43745</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Provably correct on-chip communication: a formal approach to automatic synthesis of SoC protocol converters</field><field name="creator">Avnit, Karin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The field of chip design is characterized by contradictory pressures to reduce time-to-market and maintain a high level of reliability. As a result, module reuse has become common practice in chip design. To save time on both design and verification, Systems-on-Chips (SoCs) are composed using pre-designed and pre-verified modules. The integrated modules are often designed by different groups and for different purposes, and are later integrated into a single chip. In the absence of a single interface standard for such modules, "plug-n-play" style integration is not likely, as the subject modules are often designed to comply with different interface protocols. For such modules to communicate correctly there is a need for some glue logic, also called a protocol converter that mediates between them.  Though much research has been dedicated to the protocol converter synthesis problem of SoC communication, converter synthesis is still performed manually, consuming development and verification time and risking human error. Current approaches to automatic synthesis of protocol converters mostly lack formal foundations and either employ abstractions far removed from the Hardware Description Language (HDL) implementation level or grossly simplify the structure of the protocols considered.  This thesis develops and presents techniques for automatic synthesis of provably correct on-chip protocol converters. Basing the solution on a formal approach, a novel state-machine based formalism is presented for modelling bus-based protocols and formalizing the notions of protocol compatibility and correct protocol conversion. Algorithms for automatic compatibility checking and provably-correct converter synthesis are derived from the formalism, including a systematic exploration of the design space of the protocol converter, the first in the field, which enables generation of various alternative deterministic converters. The work presented is unique in its combination of a completely formal approach and the use of a low abstraction level that enables precise modelling of protocol characteristics and automatic translation of the constructed converter to HDL.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System-on-Chip</field><field name="subject">Formal Methods</field><field name="subject">Protocol converter</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44701</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guided random-walk based model checking</field><field name="creator">Bui, Hoai Thang, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ever increasing use of computer systems in society brings emergent challenges to companies and system designers. The reliability of software and hardware can be financially critical, and lives can depend on it. The growth in size and complexity of software, and increasing concurrency, compounds the problem. The potential for errors is greater than ever before, and the stakes are higher than ever before. Formal methods, particularly model checking, is an approach that attempts to prove mathematically that a model of the behaviour of a product is correct with respect to certain properties. Certain errors can therefore be proven never to occur in the model. This approach has tremendous potential in system development to provide guarantees of correctness. Unfortunately, in practice, model checking cannot handle the enormous sizes of the models of real-world systems. The reason is that the approach requires an exhaustive search of the model to be conducted. While there are exceptions, in general model checkers are said not to scale well.  In this thesis, we deal with this scaling issue by using a guiding technique that avoids searching areas of the model, which are unlikely to contain errors. This technique is based on a process of model abstraction in which a new, much smaller model is generated that retains certain important model information but discards the rest. This new model is called a heuristic. While model checking using a heuristic as a guide can be extremely effective, in the worst case (when the guide is of no help), it performs the same as exhaustive search, and hence it also does not scale well in all cases.  A second technique is employed to deal with the scaling issue. This technique is based on the concept of random walks. A random walk is simply a `walk' through the model of the system, carried out by selecting states in the model randomly. Such a walk may encounter an error, or it may not. It is a non-exhaustive technique in the sense that only a manageable number of walks are carried out before the search is terminated. This technique cannot replace the conventional model checking as it can never guarantee the correctness of a model. It can however, be a very useful debugging tool because it scales well. From this point of view, it relieves the system designer from the difficult task of dealing with the problem of size in model checking. Using random walks, the effort goes instead into looking for errors.  The effectiveness of model checking can be greatly enhanced if the above two techniques are combined: a random walk is used to search for errors, but the walk is guided by a heuristic. This in a nutshell is the focus of this work. We should emphasise that the random walk approach uses the same formal model as model checking. Furthermore, the same heuristic technique is used to guide the random walk as a guided model checker. Together, guidance and random walks are shown in this work to result in vastly improved performance over conventional model checking. Verification has been sacrificed of course, but the new technique is able to find errors far more quickly, and deal with much larger models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heuristic search</field><field name="subject">Model checking</field><field name="subject">Guided random-walk</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44829</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promoter targeted siRNAs induce transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)</field><field name="creator">Lim, Gaik Wee Heidi, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">RNA interference is a phenomenon by which double-stranded RNA is processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can cause gene silencing in plants, yeast, Drosophila (fruit fly) and human cells. Small interfering double stranded RNAs (siRNAs) can induce gene silencing via two pathways: post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). PTGS involves siRNA triggering of sequence- specific degradation of mRNA takes place in the cell's cytoplasm. In contrast, siRNAs, which induce TGS have sequence complementary to regions within a gene's promoter and the action happens in the nucleus and is associated with de novo methylation of CpG sites and histone methylation within the promoter region.  Suziki et al. utilised siRNAs to target regions within 5'-long-terminal repeat (5'LTR) promoter region of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and subsequently induce silencing of HIV-1 in HeLa cells. Here I recapitulate the previous findings in HIV-1 by showing that certain promoter-targeted siRNAs can also induce silencing of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication by inducing CpG methylation and epigenetic changes.  A similar silencing effect was observed by using shRNA and miRNA mimics based on the most effective siRNAs. The shRNAs and miRNA mimics after conversion gained a PTGS effect in addition of TGS effect. The dual effect appeared to enhance the silencing efficiency.  Here I show that the co-localisation of Ago1 and Ago2 with a TGS inducing siRNA (si2A) in nucleus and at the rim of the nucleus respectively in SIV infected cells but not in non-infected cells. The P-body protein, GW182 complexed with si2A was found in both the nucleus and nuclear envelope and was consistent with the location Ago1/si2A and Ago2/si2A complexes. This indicated a role for this protein in TGS together with Ago proteins. Using SIV 5'-LTR luciferase reporter cells, complexes containing Ago1/Ago2/si2A were showed to work in combination and provide the optimal suppression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44889</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Political Compromise : A Study of the Origins, Structure and Performance of the Australian Defence Force Academy</field><field name="creator">Felsche, Klaus, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the stages which led to the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy. The origins of the Academy are to be found in the 1950s. The perceived need for highly qualified technical officers to handle the technological demands of the future was complemented by a perception that officers with degree-level education would be better equipped to make decisions and provide strategic advice to government than their less educated counterparts. The emergence of the tri-Service Academy concept is discussed in some detail to highlight the constantly increasing involvement in the proposal by people and organisations from outside the defence community.  The struggle between the three Services, eager to retain control over their officers' education, and the Department of Defence with its ambition to rationalise common defence functions, is described. The heated debate over the proposal to establish an armed forces university resulted in the rejection of the proposal by the Parliament Standing Committee on Public Works. The response from the Government and the Department of Defence was a modified proposal, acceptable to most of Casey University's critics, but flawed in its basic structure.  Some aspects of the Academy's performance are described and compared to the performance and experiences of the Australian single-Service colleges which preceded it and some comparable overseas institutions. The paper concludes by revisiting some of the proposals presented as alternative models for the Academy during the Public Works Committee hearings in 1978/9. These may well provide a sound basis for the future development of the Australian Defence Force Academy.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Defence Force Academy</field><field name="subject">Military education : Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44892</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terms and processes in translation between Indonesian and English</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Richard K., School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to examine particular problems that the Indonesian language poses for translators, whether translating from Indonesian to English or English to Indonesian. The notation Indonesian~English translation substitutes the swung dash ~ substitutes for the hyphen -. This notation is used in this thesis to indicate translation either from Indonesian to English or from English to Indonesian. It is a convenient way to make it clear when translation is in both directions. A multifaceted approach to translation will enable translation to be viewed in much the same way as the kinds of demands it places on the translator, who needs constantly to be aware of author~reader, source~target culture, syntax, semantics, semiotics, even geography and even politics. The use of metaphor and illustrations to describe the theoretical processes of translation is justified in the same way that imagery is justified in literature. To go a step further, it is important to see through the artificial distinction often made between interpretation and translation, so that translation acquires flexibility and a deeper ethical structure. A symbolic approach may be used by the translator., involving the perception of modules within text, identified with symbols, that can facilitate the process of translation. With Indonesian, the influx of foreign words occurred in three identifiable stages, Sanskrit, Arabic and Dutch/English. In relation to Indonesian~ English translation, the levels of Javanese and the co-existing presence of the Jakarta dialect may be compared to English vocabulary levels, for example Anglo- Saxon versus Latinate forms. This means an awareness of the existence of layers on the part of the translator. It does not imply a match between the layers in each language, philological layers between English and Indonesian, or strict equivalence between one set of borrowings in English and one in Indonesian. The hypothesis put forward is that there are advantages for the translator in being aware of waves of foreign and regional input that are part of the history of Indonesian as well as English, and that there is potential for creative utilisation of the resources of the two languages. Although a match between the layers in each language or strict equivalence between one set of  borrowings in English and one in Indonesianis not implied, it is useful to recognise word origins where this may impact on the appropriate translation. Examination of the corpus presented in this thesis has shown that the history of Indonesian words can readily affect their meaning, while the history of English words may affect the choice of terms/. Nevertheless it has proved difficult to demonstrate any particular effect of the history or layer of meaning on the choice of terminology in translation. It seems that once the Indonesian term has been understood, the translation that will emerge will not particularly be bound by reference to the history of English terminology. The hypothesis then may be reduced to an observation that the derivation of Indonesian terms, like that of English terms, is important in fully understanding the scope of meaning of the terms. The other hypothesis in this thesis is that texts or terms can be viewed as a root system containing various nodes content that the translator can respond to and wrap into the translated version, with the form of the target text possibly differing from that of the source text. The process of translation can be compared to a process of unpackaging various semantic and other elements in a unit to be translated and repackaging them for the target version. The undbundling~rebundling hypothesis is in the end a very practical matter. It aims to enlarge the discretion of the translator to carry over content with judicious changes in form. It is fair to summarise examination of the corpus by concluding that evidence of the need for unbundling~rebundling has not been convincingly presented in this thesis. It is also fair to say that in general the English translation has followed the order of the Indonesian original quite closely, and this means that a process of unbundling~rebundling is often unlikely to be necessary. Nevertheless the validity of the unbundling~rebundling approach remains, and if a text requires this kind of analysis there is ample justification for its use.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indonesian language - Translating into English</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23080</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive protocol suite for wireless sensor and ad hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Liu, Bao Hua (Michael), Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Continuing advances in wireless communications and MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechan- ical Systems) technologies have fostered the construction of a wide variety of sensor and ad hoc networks. These networks have broad applications spanning wide ar- eas, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure maintenance, traffic manage- ment, energy management, disaster mitigation, personal medical monitoring, smart building, as well as military and defence. While these applications require high per- formance from the network, they suffer from resource constraints (such as limited battery power, processing capability, buffer space, etc.) that do not appear in tra- ditional wired networks. The inherent infrastructure-less characteristic of the sensor and ad hoc networks creates significant challenges. This dissertation addresses these challenges with two protocol designs. The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of CS- MAC (stands for CDMA Sensor MAC), a novel multi-channel media access control (MAC) protocol for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) wire- less sensor networks. Our protocol design uses combination of DS-CDMA and fre- quency division to reduce the channel interference and consequently improves system capacity and network throughput. We provide theoretical characterisation of the mean multiple access interference (MAI) at a given node in relation to the number of frequency channels. We show that by using only a small number of frequency chan- nels, the mean MAI can be reduced significantly. Through discrete event simulation (using UC Berkerly NS-2 simulator), we provide comparison of our proposed system to a pure DS-CDMA system as well as a contention based system. Simulation results reveal that our proposed system can achieve significant improvement in system efi ciency (measured in packet/second/channel) of a contention based system. When the same number of packets are transmitted in the network, our system consumes much less communication energy compared to the contention based system. A distributed channel allocation protocol is also proposed for the network forma- tion phase. We prove that our algorithm converges with correct channel assignments. Simulation results reveal that a much smaller number of channels is required than theoretical value when nodes are uniformly randomly deployed. The second contribution of this dissertation involves the design and evaluation of two location-aware select optimal neighbour (SON) algorithms for CSMA/CA based MAC protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. Both algorithms concentrate on the improvement of energy eficiency of the whole network through the optimisation of the number of neighbours of each node. Our algorithms not only consider radio electronic energy consumption (e.g., coding, decoding) and radio transmission energy consumption (e.g., power amplifier), but also the electronic energy consumption at those irrelevant receivers (those who are not addressed by the transmission) that are located within the transmission range. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms can achieve signi??cant energy savings compared to the standard IEEE 802.11.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">sensor networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23387</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time, quasi-temporal change and imaginary numbers</field><field name="creator">Wiszniewski, Witold Roman, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is mainly concerned with the argument for dynamic time. Accepting McTaggart???s proof of the unreality of time, it is argued however, that any description of dynamic time involving static concepts must lead to a contradiction. It is shown that the contradiction arising from this proof is equivalent to the contradiction posed by Aristotle???s definition of change: change is the possession of incompatible properties. A special case of such a change is quasi-temporal change, defined as the possession of incomparable properties at the same time. Furthermore it is claimed that change is a primitive entity. The Block Universe view that three-dimensional dynamic and four-dimensional static representations of the world are equivalent to each other is rejected because of the unknown nature of imaginary numbers describing the time-like dimension of spacetime. It is proposed that the imaginary number i is an mathematical embodiment of change, expressed in the form of quasi-temporal variable: i = [1,-1]. As such i is a scalar variable with two numbers, 1 and ???1, assigned to it. To develop further this idea the Special Theory of Relativity and Hamilton???s theory of the complex numbers are used. It is claimed that the natures of imaginary numbers the time-like dimension are the same. It is shown that this dimension can be given by two opposite displacements of light occurring at the same time. To use Hamilton???s theory a pair of two times is proposed: normal time and dimensional time. The moments of these times are identified with the Hamilton???s primary and secondary moments of time respectively. It is shown that Hamilton???s theory is invariant upon such identification. This allows the extension of the argument forming the theory of the complex numbers. The second theme of the thesis is an argument for multiplicity of times. It is proposed that every being of a natural kind exists in its own time. Individual time is taken as a composition of topologically open time and topologically closed time. Such a composition allows an explanation of the convolution of change and permanence and also formulation of a new interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23401</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic ocular surface medium: clinical and in vitro studies</field><field name="creator">Watson, Stephanie Louise, Prince of Wale Hospital Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Therapeutic Ocular Surface Medium (TOSM) is a potential new treatment for patients with ocular surface disorders such as dry eye and persistent epithelial defect (PED). New therapies are needed as many patients with dry eye and PED continue to suffer despite maximal standard therapy, and while efficacious autologous serum therapy is not routinely available. Like serum, TOSM contains tear components and was expected to have some of the physiological effects of tears. Clinical and in vitro studies were used to evaluate two similar formulations of TOSM. To comply with local pharmacy manufacturing policies, components were omitted from TOSM v1 to produce TOSM v2. In pilot studies, conducted over 1 month, TOSM v1 improved dry eye signs and symptoms and healed over a quarter of PED. In a 2 month randomised double-masked trial, TOSM v2 improved the signs and symptoms of dry eye but was not superior to saline (placebo). No serious or irreversible side-effects occurred. The altered composition of TOSM v2 may have reduced its efficacy. However, a significant improvement in blepharitis (eyelid margin disease) and conjunctival impression cytology (an objective measure of ocular surface health) was found with TOSM v2. Improvement in blepharitis is an encouraging finding as it has not been reported in other dry eye trials. It was hypothesised that TOSM would benefit ocular surface disorders by improving ocular surface health. In vitro, primary and cell line human corneal epithelial cells were supported by TOSM v1 and TOSM v2. Outgrowth from limbal explants and corneal reepithelialisation following wounding occurred with TOSM v2. This and the impression cytology findings support our hypothesis. Further, ocular surface damage with dry eye and PED may activate the corneal wound healing response. For wound healing, compared to human serum, TOSM v1 and TOSM v2 had beneficial effects in vitro on epithelial cells and human corneal fibroblasts. This may translate into a reduction in potentially vision-threatening corneal scarring in vivo with TOSM. However, ocular surface disorders are a heterogenous group and wound healing is a complex process such that different preparations of TOSM may be needed for use in different disorders and at different stages of the disease process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Therapeutics, Ophthalmological</field><field name="subject">Eye - Diseases</field><field name="subject">Ocular Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24283</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction between physical and sedimentary biogeochemical processes in south-west Spencer Gulf, South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Emlyn Morris</field><field name="description">Located in the south-west region of Spencer Gulf, South Australia, a multi-million dollar aquaculture industry based on the ranching of southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) contributes significantly to the regional economy. The interaction between aquaculture activities and the environment is of significant interest to industry stakeholders, management authorities and the broader science community. No studies, to the best of my knowledge, have investigated the relationships between the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry of the system and the ability of the benthic ecosystem to deal with the increased loads of organic material from aquaculture activities. This thesis uses a multi-disciplinary approach combined with modern statistical techniques to explore the linkages between hydrodynamics, sediment geochemistry, sedimentary nutrient cycling and the aquaculture industry.
Modelling results have identified that swell entering the mouth of Spencer Gulf from directly south causes the greatest swell heights in the central tuna farming zone. Winds from the north-east through to south-east generate the greatest wind-wave heights in the central tuna farming zone. This is directly related to the available fetch. The energy contained in the locally generated wind waves was the same order of magnitude as that of the dissipated oceanic swells. Yet the incoming swell poses the greatest risk to aquaculture activities as the increased wave length causes swell energy to penetrate to the seafloor.
The results of this work suggest that the sediment geochemistry is tightly coupled to both the hydrodynamic regime and the buildup of silt originating from aquaculture activities. In the more exposed regions of the tuna farming zone, periodic resuspension events caused by swell propagating into the area from the Southern Ocean, resuspend fine unconsolidated sediments into the lower 10 m of the water column. This material is then advected through the region by the residual (low-frequency) currents until it settles out in areas of lower energy. This process has created two distinct provinces within the region that can either be classified as depositional or erosional.
The combined effect of wave action and tidal currents have generated a heterogeneous distribution of biogeochemical properties within the sediments. Denitrification rates were measured in these heterogeneous sediments using a novel technique based on Bayesian statistics to explicitly account for the spatial variability of the sediment biogeochemistry. The denitrification rates were found to be generally low, largely due to the lack of organic matter entering the sediments. However, adjacent to aquaculture activities, the high organic loads stimulate sedimentary denitrification, with rates reaching values of up to three orders of magnitude greater than the control sites. Denitrification efficiencies were high adjacent to the aquaculture activities, with up to 95% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen produced from the breakdown of organic matter in the sediments being removed. Variability in the denitrification efficiencies was related to the textural characteristics of the sediments, with high efficiencies in finer sediments. It is proposed that this is due to the lower permeability of these sediments restricting the advective exchange of porewater nutrients.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wave modelling</field><field name="subject">aquaculture</field><field name="subject">denitrification</field><field name="subject">sediment geochemistry</field><field name="subject">B-IPT</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100531.124356</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards obesity resistance in children: Assessing the predictors of healthy behaviours within the family environment.</field><field name="creator">Hendrie, Gilly</field><field name="description">Understanding the determinants of behaviour in children is crucial to curb the current population obesity trends.  Children's behaviour develops within the home, making it a target for obesity prevention efforts.  Previous research has identified a network of parental factors that are thought to influence children's health-related behaviour including weight, health-related knowledge and behaviour, parenting styles and practices, to name but a few.  This complexity makes it important to use theory or models to guide research and to determine the relative importance of factors within the home environment to improve the effectiveness of future obesity prevention interventions.

Embedded in psychological theory and nutrition education principles is the concept that knowledge is required for behaviour change.  This thesis provides much-needed support for the theoretical foundation that nutrition knowledge is a determinant of dietary intake behaviour.  The measurement of knowledge and the collection and interpretation of intake data are often cited as limitations to research &amp; issues this thesis aimed to address.  Modifications were made to an existing measure of nutrition knowledge, and a validation exercise conducted within a heterogeneous Australian community setting provided a valid and reliable assessment tool to measure knowledge. 

Single nutrient or food group analysis omits the synergistic nature of whole diet.  A key component of this thesis was the modification of the United States Department of Agriculture's Healthy Eating Index to be consistent with Australian dietary guidelines and its application to the interpretation of dietary intake.  An exploratory study, using the validated knowledge tool and modified diet quality index, revealed that some of the basic nutrition guidelines, such as eat more vegetables and less fatty foods, are reaching the community, but detailed knowledge of the nutrient content of foods, diet-disease relationships and making healthier food choices is poor.  Indeed, knowledge was shown to be a significant independent predictor of dietary intake and diet quality.  Knowledge was shown to be a stronger predictor of overall diet quality than of any single nutrient or food group.  

The second aim of this thesis was to disentangle the relative importance of family environmental factors in the context of obesity resistance in children.  A 12-month longitudinal study involved 154 South Australian families with primary school-aged children, and used structural equation modelling and previous research to present a model of obesity resistance.  The proposed model showed an acceptable fit (NFI=0.458; CFI=0.741; RMSEA=0.045).  Parents' BMI (&#946;=0.34*) and knowledge (&#946;=-0.21*) had the strongest direct associations with children's obesity risk.  Parents' intake and expenditure behaviours were indirectly associated with children's behaviours through the creation of the home environment.  The physical activity environment was associated with children's sedentary (&#946;=-0.44*) and activity habits (&#946;=0.29*).  The food environment was associated with fruit and vegetable intake (&#946;=0.47*).  General parenting styles (&#946;=0.63*) and child feeding practices (&#946;=-0.74*) were associated with the family environment.  Parents' knowledge also had a direct influence on their parenting practices &amp; parenting style (&#946;=0.25*) and feeding practices (&#946;=-0.50*).  The proposed model provided a comprehensive insight into the potential avenues for intervention within the complex network of factors that make up the family home environment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">obesity prevention</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">family environment</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100520.100129</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFICIENT GRID COMPUTING BASED ALGORITHMS FOR POWER SYSTEM DATA ANALYSIS</field><field name="creator">Mohsin Ali</field><field name="description">The role of electric power systems has grown steadily in both scope and importance over time making electricity increasingly recognized as a key to social and economic progress in many developing countries. In a sense, reliable power systems constitute the foundation of all prospering societies. The constant expansion in electric power systems, along with increased energy demand, requires that power systems become more and more complex. Such complexity results in much uncertainty which demands comprehensive reliability and security assessment to ensure reliable energy supply. Power industries in many countries are facing these challenges and are trying to increase the computational capability to handle the ever-increasing data and analytical needs of operations and planning. Moreover, the deregulated electricity markets have been in operation in a number of countries since the 1990s. During the deregulation process, vertically integrated power utilities have been reformed into competitive markets, with initial goals to improve market efficiency, minimize production costs and reduce the electricity price. Given the benefits that have been achieved by deregulation, several new challenges are also observed in the market. Due to fundamental changes to the electric power industry, traditional management and analysis methods cannot deal with these new challenges. Deterministic reliability assessment criteria still exists but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy the probabilistic nature of power systems. In the deterministic approach the worst case analysis results in excess operating costs. On the other hand, probabilistic methods are now widely accepted. The analytical method uses a mathematical formula for reliability evaluation and generates results more quickly but it needs accurate and a lot of assumptions and is not suitable for large and complex systems. Simulation based techniques take care of much uncertainty and simulates the random behavior of the system. However, it requires much computing power, memory and other computing resources. Power engineers have to run thousands of times domain simulations to determine the stability for a set of credible disturbances before dispatching. For example, security analysis is associated with the steady state and dynamic response of the power system to various disturbances. It is highly desirable to have real time security assessment, especially in the market environment. Therefore, novel analysis methods are required for power systems reliability and security in the deregulated environment, which can provide comprehensive results, and high performance computing (HPC) power in order to carry out such analysis within a limited time. Further, with the deregulation in power industry, operation control has been distributed among many organizations. The power grid is a complex network involving a range of energy resources including nuclear, fossil and renewable energy resources with many operational levels and layers including control centers, power plants and transmission and distribution systems. The energy resources are managed by different organizations in the electricity market and all these participants (including producers, consumers and operators) can affect the operational state of the power grid at any time. Moreover, adequacy analysis is an important task in power system planning and can be regarded as collaborative tasks, which demands the collaboration among the electricity market participants for reliable energy supply. Grid computing is gaining attention from power engineering experts as an ideal solution to the computational difficulties being faced by the power industry. Grid computing infrastructure involves the integrated and collaborative use of computers, networks, databases and scientific instruments owned and managed by multiple organizations. Grid computing technology offers potentially feasible support to the design and development of grid computing based infrastructure for power system reliability and security analysis. It can help in building infrastructure, which can provide a high performance computing and collaborative environment, and offer an optimal solution between cast and efficiency. While power system analysis is a vast topic, only a limited amount of research has been initiated in several places to investigate the applications of grid computing in power systems. This thesis will investigate probabilistic based reliability and security analysis of complex power systems in order to develop new techniques for providing comprehensive result with enormous efficiency. A review of existing techniques was conducted to determine the computational needs in the area of power systems. The main objective of this research is to propose and develop a general framework of computing grid and special grid services for probabilistic power system reliability and security assessment in the electricity market. As a result of this research, grid computing based techniques are proposed for power systems probabilistic load flow analysis, probabilistic small signal analysis, probabilistic transient stability analysis, and probabilistic contingencies analysis. Moreover, a grid computing based system is designed and developed for the monitoring and control of distributed generation systems. As a part of this research, a detailed review is presented about the possible applications of this technology in other aspects of power systems. It is proposed that these grid based techniques will provide comprehensive results that will lead to great efficiency, and ultimately enhance the existing computing capabilities of power companies in a cost-effective manner. At a part of this research, a small scale computing grid is developed which will consist of grid services for probabilistic reliability and security assessment techniques. A significant outcome of this research will be the improved performance, accuracy, and security of data sharing and collaboration. More importantly grid based computing will improve the capability of power system analysis in a deregulated environment where complex and large amounts of data would otherwise be impossible to analyze without huge investments in computing facilities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">power system analysis</field><field name="subject">Grid Computing</field><field name="subject">Grid computing based monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">parallel and distributed computing</field><field name="subject">embedded generation system monitoring and control</field><field name="subject">emerging techniques in power system analysis</field><field name="subject">power system security analysis</field><field name="subject">analysis computing grid</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204801</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing Teachers' Understanding of Critical Evaluation through Productive Pedagogies: An Action Research Case Study</field><field name="creator">Margot Bowes</field><field name="description">This case study reports the use of action research to improve teachers&#8217; understanding of critical evaluation.

Determining the molecular mechanisms regulating the development of schistosome-induced pathology, including granuloma formation, fibrosis and splenomegaly, is essential for understanding how schistosomes influence the immune system of the mammalian host. I report on the first whole genome microarray analysis of the murine liver and spleen during the progression of Schistosoma japonicum infection and of S. japonicum-Soluble Egg Antigen (SEA)-stimulated macrophages. My analyses of the infected liver revealed a distinct temporal relationship between the expression of chemokines and the recruitment of cells to the liver. T-cell and B-cell chemoattractants were up-regulated earlier reflecting the recruitment of these cells to the liver as illustrated by flow cytometry. The later phases of the response corresponded with peak accumulation of eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and myofibroblasts/hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and the expression of chemokines with activity for these cells including CCL11, members of the Monocyte-chemoattractant protein family (CCL7, CCL8, CCL12) and the hepatic stellate cell/myofibroblast chemoattractant CXCL1. Peak expression of macrophage chemoattractants (CCL6, CXCL14) and markers of alternatively-activated macrophages (e.g. Retnla) during this later phase provided further evidence for a role for these cells in schistosome-induced pathology. Additionally, I demonstrated that CCL7 immunolocalises to the fibrotic zone of granulomas. Furthermore, striking up-regulation of neutrophil markers and the localisation of neutrophils and the neutrophil chemokine S100A8 to fibrotic areas suggested the involvement of neutrophils in S. japonicum&#172;-induced hepatic fibrosis. The transcriptional profile of the spleen was closely related to changes in cellular composition illustrated by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Significant up-regulation of genes associated with progression through the cell cycle, proliferation makers and genes involved in lymphocyte proliferation, paralleled the initial expansion of T-cells and B-cells and the increased cellularity of the spleen overtime. Accumulation of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages was paralleled by enhanced expression of markers for these cells and the declining proportion of B- and T-cells in the spleen over time was reflected in the decreased expression of B- and T-cell markers. Significant up-regulation of Chi3l3 and F4/80+ macrophages suggested the presence of alternatively activated macrophages in the spleen, where these cells could play an immunoregulatory role. Comparison of the liver and spleen profiles revealed divergent expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules. Expression of lymphocyte chemokines including the homeostatic chemokines, CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21, were significantly up-regulated in the liver while down regulated in the spleen. Expression of chemokines with activity for eosinophils (CCL11, CCL24), neutrophils (CXCL1) and monocytes (CXCL14, CCL12) and the cell adhesion molecules VCAM1, NCAM1, PECAM1 were up-regulated in the liver while unchanged in the spleen. Chemokines up-regulated in both organs were expressed at significantly higher levels in the liver. Divergent expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules likely contributes to the development of a chemotactic signalling gradient that promotes recruitment of effector cells to the liver. The results of liver and spleen microarrays suggested an important role for alternatively activated macrophages in the development of schistosome-induced pathology. This led me to investigate the in vivo transcriptional profile of S. japonicum SEA-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. The transcriptional profile of these cells was characterised by up-regulation of alternatively activated macrophage makers (Chi3l3, Chi3l4, Arg1). Retnla was not significantly induced in these macrophages suggesting that the specific function of these cells may differ to those induced by S. mansoni and other parasites. Other features of the transcriptional profile of these cells included modulated expression of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules and chemokines which may confer immunomodulatory activity. S. japonicum-stimulated alternative activation of macrophages was additionally associated with deactivation of classical activation pathways and altered expression of cell surface receptors and complement components that may alter phagocytic activity. Together these data significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms associated with alternative activation of macrophages and provide significant insight into the role of these cells in schistosomiasis japonica. The findings presented in this thesis represent the most comprehensive description to date of the molecular mechanisms, and especially chemotactic signalling pathways, regulating the development of schistosome-induced granulomas, fibrosis, splenomegaly and alternative macrophage activation in the murine host. In summary, my data have revealed that co-ordinated gene expression of chemokines in the liver and spleen regulates the recruitment of cells to the liver during schistosome infection. My results provide additional evidence for a role for neutrophils and alternatively activated macrophages in the development of schistosome-induced pathology and provide further insight to the molecular basis of alternative macrophage activation during infection. Furthermore, my data serve to highlight clear differences in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis mansoni and schistosomiasis japonica. Together these findings further our understanding of the systemic, local, cellular, and especially, chemokine signalling pathways that regulate the development of S. japonicum-induced pathology and offer correlative insight into the pathogenesis of other chronic inflammatory diseases where fibrosis, splenomegaly and alternative activation of macrophages are common features.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">schistosomiasis</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="subject">helminth</field><field name="subject">parasitology</field><field name="subject">chemotaxis</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">macrophages</field><field name="subject">spleen</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">immunopathology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205370</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Cyril Scott&#8217;s Aesthetic Thinking: An Interpretation Informed by Literary and Biographical Sources</field><field name="creator">Sarah Siobhan Collins</field><field name="description">Musicological studies into the works of English composer, Cyril Scott (1879-1970), will almost ubiquitously include a brief and circumspect reference to his avowed &#8220;occult&#8221; interests. Considered for a time to be one of the most promising talents of the English Musical Renaissance, Scott is certainly a figure of great interest in the context of British music history; however, the fanatical nature of his personal activities and belief system have typically dissuaded researchers from venturing beyond a bare consideration of his music. The source of the academic reluctance is clear&#8212;those interested in pursuing Scott&#8217;s biographical details any further than the scant outline often provided are confronted with references to secret occult circles, Masters and sw&#226;mis, gnomes and angels, the &#8220;sheaths of the soul,&#8221; clairaudient investigations and disembodied Tibetan organists. The impenetrable character of Scott&#8217;s belief system has led to the arbitrary application of such cover-all terms as &#8220;mystical&#8221; or &#8220;Theosophical&#8221; in its description, thereby effectively sealing shut a potential hermeneutic gateway into his musical output, and eluding a further understanding of the man himself. Much of the biographical information currently available on Scott relies almost solely on the detail provided in the composer&#8217;s own two autobiographies. These are clearly problematic sources on which to base our understanding, for a number of reasons. The difficulties associated with approaching Scott&#8217;s belief system are similar to those regarding his biographical detail, including issues of authenticity, representation and &#8220;veiling.&#8221; As a result, much of Scott&#8217;s thinking has remained hidden in his sizable literary oeuvre, untouched by musicologists. Within his literary output is revealed a distinct line of developing aesthetic thought, culminating in a theory which he considered to have been his greatest literary contribution. By examining Scott&#8217;s literary output and extrapolating new biographical detail from other sources, there begins to appear a clearer picture of how Scott&#8217;s aesthetic thinking gradually became intimately entwined in, and driven by, his developing philosophical outlook and spiritual beliefs. It is the contention of this thesis that Scott&#8217;s aesthetic thought, rather than falling within an &#8220;Orientalist&#8221; or merely &#8220;Theosophical&#8221; construct, was actually firmly rooted in the aestheticism of modernist anti-rationalist philosophies traditionally associated with certain literary movements, particularly Symbolism. From this characterisation, the present study will explore Scott&#8217;s aesthetic theorizing within the framework of his spiritual development. Its purpose is to initiate a new and more comprehensive platform from which to approach Scott&#8217;s music and also to raise new questions regarding the impact of the aesthetics of particular literary trends on the position of music within early twentieth-century aesthetic theories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyril Scott (1879-1970), English music history, late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, aesthetics, modernism.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205375</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le grand voyage</field><field name="creator">Garet, Catherine Annie France</field><field name="description">For most writers who deal with displacement, rewriting themselves, articulating and communicating their sense of estrangment is their lifetime work. For displacement forces one to leave behind the familiar and embrace the unknown. In this process of deconstruction, the concepts of home, belonging and identity are renegotiated and questioned constantly. Le Grand Voyage &#8211; the working title for the draft of a novel that is presented in conjunction with this exegesis &#8211; is a fictional work that is produced out of the implications of displacement, which inscribes itself in a series of explorations I started in 2001, cumulating with two video works Frammento in 2003 and Footnotes in 2004. Le Grand Voyage investigates further the concept of home by questioning the home/mother relationship. The exegesis aims to contextualise the making of Le Grand Voyage by using another woman&#8217;s narrative as the main point of reference: Linda Olsson&#8217;s Let Me Sing You Gentle Songs (2005). Olsson&#8217;s work &#8211; like mine &#8211; is conceived out of the effects of displacement, and the literary form and structure display symptoms that are characteristics to narratives of displacement. By putting the home/mother/daughter in context, the narrative displays home as a patriarchal construct showing how the idealisation of home/place is predicated on a gendering of home, whereby, as McDermott notes, &#8216;home is constructed as a maternal, static and past, to which the (male) subjects longs to return&#8217; (2003: 265). The narrative&#8217;s point of view is that of daughters but also that of mothers as daughters, and enables not only a feminist discussion of the notion of home but also of motherhood. Therefore, the theoretical approach for this work has encompassed feminists&#8217; writings that have particularly focused their research on space, place and gender. In challenging the dominant form of gender constructions and relations, the first and second wave feminism have empowered many women to leave home in order to shape their own version of identity. I believe it is within the perspective of displacement, of being out of place, that many women continue to find the necessary distance to contest a particular reading of woman and home that still prevails in academic literature and fiction. Thus, an important part of this exegesis concentrates on the critic of home. I want to argue in a feminist way that our ideas of home and belonging still reflect gendered assumptions and are therefore contestable. That displacement as a catalyst for loss, emotional grief and mourning becomes an enabling way for women to rethink home in terms of what was at play rather than in place and to do the &#8216;memory work&#8217; that feminists ask women to do: to remember in order not to forget because &#8216;forgetting is a major obstacle to change&#8217; (Greene, 1991: 298). Their attacks on the feminisation of place have opened up for me possibilities to think of home outside the parameters of sameness. They have also enabled me to understand the paradoxical position a displaced person is faced with: if displacement is favored and privileged why then do longings for home still persist for some? &#8211; a fact that is well illustrated in the actual resurgence of the preoccupation to belong. The gain in displacement also involves the fact that distance forces one to look at the longing and nostalgia for what they really conceal. In the case of a woman and, motherless daughters, distance, as this exegesis demonstrates, enables the writer to unveil the longings as subversive and fraudulent, tricking women into thinking there was nothing better than the past: home sweet home, the safe, bounded nest where women could be women: could be the mother. With the &#8216;memory work&#8217; they both learn to think away from the parameters of sameness and the past, outside the nostalgic stances of singularity, safety, boundaries and internalised histories, therefore outside of the maternal, the home/mother relationship. &#8216;What is home?&#8217; is a difficult question to negotiate for a woman. The exegesis and the first draft of the novel show what is at stake when one asks the question and the responsibility of women when writing about home.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concept of home</field><field name="subject">Narrative of displacement</field><field name="subject">Feminist perspective</field><field name="subject">Mother/daughter relationship</field><field name="subject">First draft novel</field><field name="subject">Linda Olsson&#8217;s "Let me sing you gentle songs" (2005)</field><field name="subject">Feminisation of place</field><field name="subject">Nostalgia</field><field name="subject">Gender construction</field><field name="subject">Home/mother relationship</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Longings</field><field name="subject">Gendering of home</field><field name="subject">Literary structure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/903</field><field name="validLink">True</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a kinetic model to support control decisions in a chloraminated distribution system /</field><field name="creator">Gnos, Gregory</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEngineering(HydrologyWaterRes))--University of South Australia, 2007.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chloramines.</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Water quality</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80796</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44422</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of temporality in Alzheimer's dementia : n existential philosophical interpretation</field><field name="creator">Glonek, Judith A</field><field name="description">This thesis represents a work of basic research into dimensions of time and space, referred to as temporality, in the condition Alzheimer's dementia.

Between pH 4.5 and 9.5 where PDMS droplets and the silica probe are both negatively charged, a repulsive force is evident that increases less rapidly on surface approach than expected for electrical double layer interaction of rigid particles. The departure from hard-sphere behaviour, i.e. the deformation, has been determined and by varying the extent of internal cross-linking within the PDMS droplets, the influence of bulk rheology and interfacial properties on droplet deformation and nano-rheology has been isolated. For highly cross-linked droplets, the extent of deformation is controlled by the bulk rheology rather than the droplet's interfacial properties. Upon retraction of the surfaces, force curve hysteresis is observed and is due to the viscoelastic response of the PDMS. The extent of hysteresis is dependent on the rate of approach/retraction anf the loading force, and has been theretically fitted to obtain nano-rheological paraameters, which describe the droplet relaxation process. For liquid-like droplets, with a low level of cross-linking, no force curve hysteresis is observed and the elastic deformation may be described by a single spring constant. The spring constant is proportional to the surface tension (as controlled by surfactant adsortion) and the reciprocal of the droplet radius, i.e. deformation is controlled by the Laplace pressure. Furthermore, droplet deformation is altered by the presence of adsorbed nano-particles. These colloid probe AFM studies offer due insight into the deformation and interaction of emulsion droplets and have implications when considering the stability, adhesion and processing of emulsions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Deformations (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Emulsions</field><field name="subject">Colloids</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/80535</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43906</field><field name="validLink">False</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a model for the online delivery of nurse education /</field><field name="creator">Gillham, David</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a well-defined sequential program of education projects in the area of online nurse and health sciences education culminating in a model for online nurse education based on the concept of a shared database.
