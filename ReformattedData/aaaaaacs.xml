From a statistical point of view this corresponds to computing the Maximum likelihood estimate, under the assumption of Gaussian noise. However, it is well known that this choice leads to results that are very sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data. For this reason it has been proposed to minimize the functions of the form Eni=1V(gi-f), where V is a function that increases less rapidly than the square. Several choices for V have been proposed and successfully used to obtain "robust" estimates. In this paper we show that, for a class of functions V, using these robust estimators corresponds to assuming that data are corrupted by Gaussian noise whose variance fluctuates according to some given probability distribution, that uniquely determines the shape of V.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1287</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1287</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Green Theorems and Qualitative Properties of the Optical Flow</field><field name="creator">Poggio, Tomaso</field><field name="description">How can one compute qualitative properties of the optical flow, such as expansion or rotation, in a way which is robust and invariant to the position of the focus of expansion or the center of rotation?

Are they  related? The main point of this paper is to  show that for normalized inputs, multilayer  perceptron networks are radial function  networks (albeit with a non-standard radial  function). This provides an interpretation of the  weights w as centers t of the radial function  network, and therefore as equivalent to  templates. This insight may be useful for  practical applications, including better  initialization procedures for MLP. In the  remainder of the paper, we discuss the  relation between the radial functions that  correspond to the sigmoid for normalized  inputs and well-behaved radial basis  functions, such as the Gaussian. In particular,  we observe that the radial function associated  with the sigmoid is an activation function that  is good approximation to Gaussian basis  functions for a range of values of the bias  parameter. The implication is that a MLP  network can always simulate a Gaussian  GRBF network (with the same number of units  but less parameters); the converse is true  only for certain values of the bias parameter.  Numerical experiments indicate that this  constraint is not always satisfied in practice by  MLP networks trained with backpropagation.  Multiscale GRBF networks, on the other hand,  can approximate MLP networks with a similar  number of parameters.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1291</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1291</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tactual Display of Consonant Voicing to Supplement Lipreading</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Hanfeng</field><field name="description">This research is concerned with the development of tactual displays to supplement the information available through lipreading. Because voicing carries a high informational load in speech and is not well transmitted through lipreading, the efforts are focused on providing tactual displays of voicing to supplement the information available on the lips of the talker. This research includes exploration of 1) signal-processing schemes to extract information about voicing from the acoustic speech signal, 2) methods of displaying this information through a multi-finger tactual display, and 3) perceptual evaluations of voicing reception through the tactual display alone (T), lipreading alone (L), and the combined condition (L+T). Signal processing for the extraction of voicing information used amplitude-envelope signals derived from filtered bands of speech (i.e., envelopes derived from a lowpass-filtered band at 350 Hz and from a highpass-filtered band at 3000 Hz). Acoustic measurements made on the envelope signals of a set of 16 initial consonants represented through multiple tokens of C1VC2 syllables indicate that the onset-timing difference between the low- and high-frequency envelopes (EOA: envelope-onset asynchrony) provides a reliable and robust cue for distinguishing voiced from voiceless consonants. This acoustic cue was presented through a two-finger tactual display such that the envelope of the high-frequency band was used to modulate a 250-Hz carrier signal delivered to the index finger (250-I) and the envelope of the low-frequency band was used to modulate a 50-Hz carrier delivered to the thumb (50T). The temporal-onset order threshold for these two signals, measured with roving signal amplitude and duration, averaged 34 msec, sufficiently small for use of the EOA cue. Perceptual evaluations of the tactual display of EOA with speech signal indicated: 1) that the cue was highly effective for discrimination of pairs of voicing contrasts; 2) that the identification of 16 consonants was improved by roughly 15 percentage points with the addition of the tactual cue over L alone; and 3) that no improvements in L+T over L were observed for reception of words in sentences, indicating the need for further training on this task</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Technical Report (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Research Laboratory of Electronics);669</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intelligence Without Reason</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Rodney A.</field><field name="description">Computers and Thought are the two categories that together define Artificial Intelligence as a discipline.

The Von Neumann model of computation has lead Artificial Intelligence in particular directions. Intelligence in biological systems is completely different.

The theory  stresses the opportunistic nature of designing  and the complementary roles of focus and  distraction, the interdependence of evaluation  and generation, the multiplicity of ways of  seeing over the history of a design session  versus the exclusivity of a given way of seeing  over an arbitrarily short period, and the  incommensurability of criteria used to  evaluate a design. The thesis argues for a  principle based rather than rule based  approach to designing documents. The  Discursive Generator is presented as a  computational framework for implementing  specific design systems, and a simple  system for arranging blocks according to a set  of formal principles is developed by way of  illustration. Both shape grammars and  constraint based systems are used to  contrast current trends in design automation  with the discursive approach advocated in the  thesis. The Discursive Generator is shown to  have some important properties lacking in  other types of systems, such as dynamism,  robustness and the ability to deal with partial  designs. When studied in terms of a search  metaphor, the Discursive Generator is shown  to exhibit behavior which is radically different  from some traditional search techniques, and  to avoid some of the well-known difficulties  associated with them.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1309</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1309</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sequence-Seeking and Counter Streams: A Model for Information Processing in the Cortex</field><field name="creator">Ullman, Shimon</field><field name="description">This paper presents a model for the general flow in the neocortex.

The search is bi-directional, "bottom-up" as well as "top-down," and it explores in parallel a large numbe rof alternative sequences. This operation is implemented in a structure termed "counter streams," in which multiple sequences are explored along two separate, complementary pathways which seeking to meet. The first part of the paper discusses the general sequence-seeking scheme and a number of related processes, such as the learning of successful sequences, context effects, and the use of "express lines" and partial matches. The second part discusses biological implications of the model in terms of connections within and between cortical areas.

The "curvature method", developed by Basri and Ullman [1988], provides a method to approximate the appearance of such objects from different viewpoints. In this paper we analyze the curvature method. We apply the method to ellipsoidal objects and compute analytically the error obtained for different rotations of the objects. The error depends on the exact shape of the ellipsoid (namely, the relative lengths of its axes), and it increases a sthe ellipsoid becomes "deep" (elongated in the Z-direction). We show that the errors are usually small, and that, in general, a small number of models is required to predict the appearance of an ellipsoid from all possible views. Finally, we show experimentally that the curvature method applies as well to objects with hyperbolic surface patches.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1332</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1332</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On The Uniqueness of Correspondence Under Orthographic and Perspective Projections</field><field name="creator">Basri, Ronen</field><field name="description">The task of shape recovery from a motion sequence requires the establishment of correspondence between image points. The two processes, the matching process and the shape recovery one, are traditionally viewed as independent. Yet, information obtained during the process of shape recovery can be used to guide the matching process. This paper discusses the mutual relationship between the two processes. The paper is divided into two parts. In the first part we review the constraints imposed on the correspondence by rigid transformations and extend them to objects that undergo general affine (non rigid) transformation (including stretch and shear), as well as to rigid objects with smooth surfaces. In all these cases corresponding points lie along epipolar lines, and these lines can be recovered from a small set of corresponding points. In the second part of the paper we discuss the potential use of epipolar lines in the matching process. We present an algorithm that recovers the correspondence from three contour images. The algorithm was implemented and used to construct object models for recognition.

We distinguish between two types of similarity metrics: metrics computed in image-space (image metrics) and metrics computed in transformation-space (transformation metrics). Existing methods typically use image and the nearest view of the object. Example for such a measure is the Euclidean distance between feature points in the image and corresponding points in the nearest view. (Computing this measure is equivalent to solving the exterior orientation calibration problem.) In this paper we introduce a different type of metrics: transformation metrics. These metrics penalize for the deformatoins applied to the object to produce the observed image. We present a transformation metric that optimally penalizes for "affine deformations" under weak-perspective. A closed-form solution, together with the nearest view according to this metric, are derived. The metric is shown to be equivalent to the Euclidean image metric, in the sense that they bound each other from both above and below.

The method  is based on representing the scene as a set  of 2D views and predicting the appearances  of novel views by linear combinations of the  model views.

Analysis of this  projection as well as experimental results  demonstrate that in many cases it is sufficient  to accurately describe the scene.

Furthermore, recognition systems often rely  on the "weak-perspective" imaging model in  place of the perspective imaging model. This  paper discusses computing the pose of a  model from three corresponding points under  weak-perspective projection. A new solution to  the problem is proposed which, like previous  solutins, involves solving a biquadratic  equation. Here the biquadratic is motivate  geometrically and its solutions, comprised of  an actual and a false solution, are interpreted  graphically.

This paper describes the theory and implementation issues of tracking any desired point in the environment. This method is performed completely in software without any need to mechanically move the camera relative to the vehicle. This tracking technique is simple an inexpensive. Furthermore, it does not use either optical flow or feature correspondence. Instead, the spatio-temporal gradients of the input intensity images are used directly. The experimental results presented support the idea of tracking in software. The final result is a sequence of tracked images where the desired point is kept stationary in the images independent of the nature of the relative motion. Finally, the quality of these tracked images are examined using spatio-temporal gradient maps.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1382</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1382</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some Extensions of the K-Means Algorithm for Image Segmentation and Pattern Classification</field><field name="creator">Marroquin, Jose L.</field><field name="description">In this paper we present some extensions to  the k-means algorithm for vector quantization  that permit its efficient use in image  segmentation and pattern classification tasks.

The scheme  proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, the  categorization stage, the image is compared  to prototype objects. For each prototype, the  view that most resembles the image is  recovered, and, if the view is found to be  similar to the image, the class identity of the  object is determined. In the second stage, the  identification stage, the observed object is  compared to the individual models of its  class, where classes are expected to contain  objects with relatively similar shapes. For  each model, a view that matches the image is  sought. If such a view is found, the object's  specific identity is determined. The advantage  of categorizing the object before it is identified  is twofold. First, the image is compared to a  smaller number of models, since only models  that belong to the object's class need to be  considered. Second, the cost of comparing  the image to each model in a classis very low,  because correspondence is computed once  for the whoel class. More specifically, the  correspondence and object pose computed in  the categorization stage to align the prototype  with the image are reused in the identification  stage to align the individual models with the  image. As a result, identification is reduced to  a series fo simple template comparisons.  The paper concludes with an algorithm for  constructing optimal prototypes for classes of  objects.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1391</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1391</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analytical Representation of Contours</field><field name="creator">Chaney, Ronald D.</field><field name="description">The interpretation and recognition of noisy contours, such as silhouettes, have proven to be difficult. One obstacle to the solution of these problems has been the lack of a robust representation for contours. The contour is represented by a set of pairwise tangent circular arcs. The advantage of such an approach is that mathematical properties such as orientation and curvature are explicityly represented. We introduce a smoothing criterion for the contour tht optimizes the tradeoff between the complexity of the contour and proximity of the data points. The complexity measure is the number of extrema of curvature present in the contour. The smoothing criterion leads us to a true scale-space for contours. We describe the computation of the contour representation as well as the computation of relevant properties of the contour. We consider the potential application of the representation, the smoothing paradigm, and the scale-space to contour interpretation and recognition.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1392</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1392</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploiting the Parallelism Exposed by Partial Evaluation</field><field name="creator">Berlin, Andrew A.</field><field name="description">We describe an approach to parallel compilation that seeks to harness the vast amount of fine-grain parallelism that is exposed through partial evaluation of numerically-intensive scientific programs.

For a two-grating plaid pattern,  this translates to either tracking the grating  intersections or to appropriately combining  the motion estimates for each grating. Since  both component and feature information are  simultaneously available in any plaid pattern  made of contrast defined gratings, it is  unclear how to determine which of the two  schemes is actually used to recover the  plaid"s motion. To address this problem, we  have designed a plaid pattern made with  subjective, rather than contrast defined,  gratings. The distinguishing characteristic of  such a plaid pattern is that it contains no  contrast defined intersections that may be  tracked. We find that notwithstanding the  absence of such features, observers can  accurately recover the pattern velocity.  Additionally we show that the hypothesis of  tracking "illusory features" to estimate pattern  motion does not stand up to experimental  test. These results present direct evidence in support of the idea that calls for  the integration of component motions over the  one that mandates tracking localized features  to recover 2D pattern motion. The localized  features, we suggest, are used primarily as  providers of grouping information - which  component motion signals to integrate and  which not to.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1415</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1415</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formalizing Triggers: A Learning Model for Finite Spaces</field><field name="creator">Niyogi, Partha</field><field name="description">In a recent seminal paper, Gibson and Wexler  (1993) take important steps to formalizing the  notion of language learning in a (finite) space  whose grammars are characterized by a finite  number of parameters.

Inferotemporal neurons  are known to respond to complex visual  stimuli, including patterns like faces, hands,  or other body parts. What is the role of such  neurons in object recognition? The present  study examines this question in combined  psychophysical and electrophysiological  experiments, in which monkeys learned to  classify and recognize novel visual 3D  objects. A population of neurons in IT were  found to respond selectively to such objects  that the monkeys had recently learned to  recognize. A large majority of these cells  discharged maximally for one view of the  object, while their response fell off gradually  as the object was rotated away from the  neuron"s preferred view. Most neurons  exhibited orientation-dependent responses  also during view-plane rotations. Some  neurons were found tuned around two views  of the same object, while a very small number  of cells responded in a view- invariant  manner. For five different objects that were  extensively used during the training of the  animals, and for which behavioral  performance became view-independent,  multiple cells were found that were tuned  around different views of the same object. No  selective responses were ever encountered  for views that the animal systematically failed  to recognize. The results of our experiments  suggest that neurons in this area can develop  a complex receptive field organization as a  consequence of extensive training in the  discrimination and recognition of objects.  Simple geometric features did not appear to  account for the neurons" selective responses.  These findings support the idea that a  population of neurons -- each tuned to a  different object aspect, and each showing a  certain degree of invariance to image  transformations -- may, as an assembly,  encode complex 3D objects. In such a  system, several neurons may be active for any  given vantage point, with a single unit acting  like a blurred template for a limited  neighborhood of a single view.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1533</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1533</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aeroacoustics on Non-Dedicated Workstations</field><field name="creator">Skordos, Panayotis A.</field><field name="description">The simulation of subsonic aeroacoustic problems such as the flow-generated sound of wind instruments is well suited for parallel computing on a cluster of non-dedicated workstations.

In this paper, we introduce a vectorized image representation, which is a feature-based representation where correspondence has been established with respect to a reference image. This representation has two components: (1) shape, or (x, y) feature locations, and (2) texture, defined as the image grey levels mapped onto the standard reference image. This paper explores an automatic technique for "vectorizing" face images. Our face vectorizer alternates back and forth between computation steps for shape and texture, and a key idea is to structure the two computations so that each one uses the output of the other. A hierarchical coarse-to-fine implementation is discussed, and applications are presented to the problems of facial feature detection and registration of two arbitrary faces.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1537</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1537</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Cuts for Accelerated Interval Propagation</field><field name="creator">McAllester, D.</field><field name="description">This paper addresses the problem of  nonlinear multivariate root finding.

This paper analyzes the Saliency Network.  The Saliency Network is attractive for several  reasons. First, the network generally prefers  long and smooth curves over short or wiggly  ones. While computing saliencies, the  network also fills in gaps with smooth  completions and tolerates noise. Finally, the  network is locally connected, and its size is  proportional to the size of the image.  Nevertheless, our analysis reveals certain  weaknesses with the method. In particular,  we show cases in which the most salient  element does not lie on the perceptually most  salient curve. Furthermore, in some cases the  saliency measure changes its preferences  when curves are scaled uniformly. Also, we  show that for certain fragmented curves the  measure prefers large gaps over a few small  gaps of the same total size. In addition, we  analyze the time complexity required by the  method. We show that the number of steps  required for convergence in serial  implementations is quadratic in the size of the  network, and in parallel implementations is  linear in the size of the network. We discuss  problems due to coarse sampling of the  range of possible orientations. We show that  with proper sampling the complexity of the  network becomes cubic in the size of the  network. Finally, we consider the possibility of  using the Saliency Network for grouping. We  show that the Saliency Network recovers the  most salient curve efficiently, but it has  problems with identifying any salient curve  other than the most salient one.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1550</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1550</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Network Charge-Orineted MOS Transistor Model</field><field name="creator">Katzenelson, Jacob</field><field name="description">The MOS transistor physical model as described in [3] is presented here as a network model. The goal is to obtain an accurate model, suitable for simulation, free from certain problems reported in the literature [13], and conceptually as simple as possible. To achieve this goal the original model had to be extended and modified. The paper presents the derivation of the network model from physical equations, including the corrections which are required for simulation and which compensate for simplifications introduced in the original physical model. Our intrinsic MOS model consists of three nonlinear voltage-controlled capacitors and a dependent current source. The charges of the capacitors and the current of the current source are functions of the voltages $V_{gs}$, $V_{bs}$, and $V_{ds}$. The complete model consists of the intrinsic model plus the parasitics. The apparent simplicity of the model is a result of hiding information in the characteristics of the nonlinear components. The resulted network model has been checked by simulation and analysis. It is shown that the network model is suitable for simulation: It is defined for any value of the voltages; the functions involved are continuous and satisfy Lipschitz conditions with no jumps at region boundaries; Derivatives have been computed symbolically and are available for use by the Newton-Raphson method. The model"s functions can be measured from the terminals. It is also shown that small channel effects can be included in the model. Higher frequency effects can be modeled by using a network consisting of several sections of the basic lumped model. Future plans include a detailed comparison of the network model with models such as SPICE level 3 and a comparison of the multi- section higher frequency model with experiments.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1551</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1551</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimizing Statistical Bias with Queries</field><field name="creator">Cohn, David A.</field><field name="description">I describe an exploration criterion that  attempts to minimize the error of a learner by  minimizing its estimated squared bias.

To study the neural mechanism that underlies such competitive interactions, single cells were recorded in the visual areas V1, V2, and V4, while monkeys reported the perceived orientation of rivaling sinusoidal grating patterns. A number of neurons in all areas showed alternating periods of excitation and inhibition that correlated with the perceptual dominance and suppression of the cell"s preferred orientation. The remaining population of cells were not influenced by whether or not the optimal stimulus orientation was perceptually suppressed. Response modulation during rivalry was not correlated with cell attributes such as monocularity, binocularity, or disparity tuning. These results suggest that the awareness of a visual pattern during binocular rivalry arises through interactions between neurons at different levels of visual pathways, and that the site of suppression is unlikely to correspond to a particular visual area, as often hypothesized on the basis of psychophysical observations. The cell-types of modulating neurons and their overwhelming preponderance in higher rather than in early visual areas also suggests -- together with earlier psychophysical evidence -- the possibility of a common mechanism underlying rivalry as well as other bistable percepts, such as those experienced with ambiguous figures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1553</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1553</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Attention in Binocular Rivalry as Revealed Through Optokinetic Nystagmus</field><field name="creator">Leopold, D.A.</field><field name="description">When stimuli presented to the two eyes differ considerably, stable binocular fusion fails, and the subjective percept alternates between the two monocular images, a phenomenon known as binocular rivalry. The influence of attention over this perceptual switching has long been studied, and although there is evidence that attention can affect the alternation rate, its role in the overall dynamics of the rivalry process remains unclear. The present study investigated the relationship between the attention paid to the rivalry stimulus, and the dynamics of the perceptual alternations. Specifically, the temporal course of binocular rivalry was studied as the subjects performed difficult nonvisual and visual concurrent tasks, directing their attention away from the rivalry stimulus. Periods of complete perceptual dominance were compared for the attended condition, where the subjects reported perceptual changes, and the unattended condition, where one of the simultaneous tasks was performed. During both the attended and unattended conditions, phases of rivalry dominance were obtained by analyzing the subject"s optokinetic nystagmus recorded by an electrooculogram, where the polarity of the nystagmus served as an objective indicator of the perceived direction of motion. In all cases, the presence of a difficult concurrent task had little or no effect on the statistics of the alternations, as judged by two classic tests of rivalry, although the overall alternation rate showed a small but significant increase with the concurrent task. It is concluded that the statistical patterns of rivalry alternations are not governed by attentional shifts or decision-making on the part of the subject.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1554</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1554</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Three-Dimensional Interpretation of a Class of Simple Line-Drawings</field><field name="creator">Marill, Thomas</field><field name="description">We provide a theory of the three-dimensional interpretation of a class of line-drawings called p-images, which are interpreted by the human vision system as parallelepipeds ("boxes"). Despite their simplicity, p-images raise a number of interesting vision questions: *Why are p-images seen as three-dimensional objects? Why not just as flatimages? *What are the dimensions and pose of the perceived objects? *Why are some p-images interpreted as rectangular boxes, while others are seen as skewed, even though there is no obvious distinction between the images? *When p-images are rotated in three dimensions, why are the image-sequences perceived as distorting objects---even though structure-from-motion would predict that rigid objects would be seen? *Why are some three-dimensional parallelepipeds seen as radically different when viewed from different viewpoints? We show that these and related questions can be answered with the help of a single mathematical result and an associated perceptual principle. An interesting special case arises when there are right angles in the p-image. This case represents a singularity in the equations and is mystifying from the vision point of view. It would seem that (at least in this case) the vision system does not follow the ordinary rules of geometry but operates in accordance with other (and as yet unknown) principles.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1555</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1555</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Fine Motion by Markov Mixtures of Experts</field><field name="creator">Meila, Marina</field><field name="description">Compliant control is a standard method for performing fine manipulation tasks, like grasping and assembly, but it requires estimation of the state of contact between the robot arm and the objects involved.

The current state of contact is viewed as the hidden state variable of a discrete HMM. The control dependent transition probabilities between states are modeled as parametrized functions of the measurement We show that their parameters can be estimated from measurements concurrently with the estimation of the parameters of the movement in each state of contact. The learning algorithm is a variant of the EM procedure. The E step is computed exactly; solving the M step exactly would require solving a set of coupled nonlinear algebraic equations in the parameters.

The learning algorithm compiles a corpus of words into increasingly sophisticated constraints. The algorithm is incremental, greedy, and fast.

DPLs are languages for presenting, discovering, and checking formal proofs. In particular, in this paper we discus type-alpha DPLs---a simple class of DPLs  for which termination is guaranteed and proof checking can be  performed in time linear in the size of the proof.  Type-alpha DPLs allow for lucid proof presentation and for efficient proof checking, but not for proof search.  Type-omega DPLs allow for search as well as simple presentation and checking, but termination is no longer guaranteed and  proof checking may diverge. We do not study type-omega DPLs here.   We start by listing some common characteristics of DPLs. We  then illustrate with a particularly simple example: a toy  type-alpha DPL called PAR, for deducing parities. We present the abstract syntax of PAR, followed by two  different kinds of formal semantics: evaluation and denotational.  We then relate the two semantics and show how proof checking  becomes tantamount to evaluation. We proceed to develop the  proof theory of PAR, formulating and studying certain  key notions such as observational equivalence that pervade all DPLs.   We then present NDL, a type-alpha DPL for classical zero-order  natural deduction. Our presentation of NDL mirrors that of PAR,  showing how every basic concept that was introduced in PAR resurfaces in NDL. We present sample proofs of several well-known tautologies of propositional logic that demonstrate our thesis that DPL proofs are  readable, writable, and concise. Next we contrast DPLs to typed logics based  on the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and discuss the distinction between pure and augmented DPLs. Finally we consider the issue of  implementing DPLs, presenting an implementation of PAR in SML and one in Athena, and end with some concluding remarks.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-025</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Deduction</field><field name="subject">formal proofs</field><field name="subject">semantics</field><field name="subject">proof checking</field><field name="subject">soundness</field><field name="subject">logic</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-025</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Type-omega DPLs</field><field name="creator">Arkoudas, Konstantine</field><field name="description">Type-omega DPLs (Denotational Proof Languages) are languages for proof presentation and search that offer strong soundness guarantees. LCF-type systems such as HOL offer similar guarantees, but their soundness relies heavily on static type systems. By contrast, DPLs  ensure soundness dynamically, through their evaluation semantics; no type system is necessary. This is possible owing to a novel two-tier syntax  that separates deductions from computations, and to the abstraction of assumption bases, which is factored into the semantics of the language and allows for sound evaluation.   Every type-omega DPL properly contains a type-alpha DPL, which can be used to present proofs in a lucid and detailed form, exclusively in terms of primitive inference rules. Derived inference rules are expressed  as user-defined methods, which are "proof recipes" that take arguments  and dynamically perform appropriate deductions. Methods arise naturally  via parametric abstraction over type-alpha proofs. In that light, the  evaluation of a method call can be viewed as a computation that carries  out a type-alpha deduction. The type-alpha proof "unwound" by such a method  call is called the "certificate" of the call. Certificates can be checked  by exceptionally simple type-alpha interpreters, and thus they are useful  whenever we wish to minimize our trusted base.   Methods are statically closed over lexical environments, but dynamically scoped over assumption bases. They can take other methods as arguments, they can iterate, and they can branch conditionally. These capabilities,  in tandem with the bifurcated syntax of type-omega DPLs and their dynamic assumption-base semantics, allow the user to define methods in  a style that is disciplined enough to ensure soundness yet fluid enough  to permit succinct and perspicuous expression of arbitrarily sophisticated derived inference rules.   We demonstrate every major feature of type-omega DPLs by defining and studying NDL-omega, a higher-order, lexically scoped, call-by-value type-omega DPL for classical zero-order natural deduction---a simple choice that allows us to focus on type-omega syntax and semantics rather than on the subtleties of the underlying logic. We start by illustrating how type-alpha DPLs naturally lead to type-omega DPLs by way of abstraction; present the formal syntax and semantics of NDL-omega; prove several results about it, including soundness; give numerous examples of methods; point out connections to the lambda-phi calculus, a very general framework for type-omega DPLs; introduce a notion of computational and deductive cost; define several instrumented interpreters for computing such costs and for generating certificates; explore the use of type-omega DPLs as general programming languages; show that DPLs do not have to be type-less by formulating a static Hindley-Milner polymorphic type system for NDL-omega; discuss some idiosyncrasies of type-omega DPLs such as the potential divergence of proof checking; and compare type-omega DPLs to other approaches to proof presentation and discovery. Finally, a complete implementation of NDL-omega in SML-NJ is given for users who want to run the examples and experiment with the language.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-027</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">deduction</field><field name="subject">computation</field><field name="subject">proof search</field><field name="subject">soundness</field><field name="subject">logic</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-027</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How do Humans Determine Reflectance Properties under Unknown Illumination?</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Roland W.</field><field name="description">Under normal viewing conditions, humans find it easy to distinguish between objects made out of different materials such as plastic, metal, or paper. Untextured materials such as these have different surface reflectance properties, including lightness and gloss. With single isolated images and unknown illumination conditions, the task of estimating surface reflectance is highly underconstrained, because many combinations of reflection and illumination are consistent with a given image. In order to work out how humans estimate surface reflectance properties, we asked subjects to match the appearance of isolated spheres taken out of their original contexts. We found that subjects were able to perform the task accurately and reliably without contextual information to specify the illumination. The spheres were rendered under a variety of artificial illuminations, such as a single point light source, and a number of photographically-captured real-world illuminations from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Subjects performed more accurately for stimuli viewed under real-world patterns of illumination than under artificial illuminations, suggesting that subjects use stored assumptions about the regularities of real-world illuminations to solve the ill-posed problem.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-032</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">illumination</field><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="subject">natural image statistics</field><field name="subject">human vision</field><field name="subject">BRDF</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-032</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition of Surface Reflectance Properties from a Single Image under Unknown Real-World Illumination</field><field name="creator">Dror, Ron O.</field><field name="description">This paper describes a machine vision system that classifies reflectance properties of surfaces such as metal, plastic, or paper, under unknown real-world illumination.

New programming paradigms are required for obtaining organized and coherent behavior from the cooperation of large numbers of unreliable processing elements that are interconnected in unknown, irregular, and possibly time-varying ways. Amorphous computing is the study of developing and programming such ultrascale computing environments. This paper presents an approach to programming an amorphous computer by spontaneously organizing an unstructured collection of processing elements into cooperative groups and hierarchies. This paper introduces a structure called an AC Hierarchy, which logically organizes processors into groups at different levels of granularity. The AC hierarchy simplifies programming of an amorphous computer through new language abstractions, facilitates the design of efficient and robust algorithms, and simplifies the analysis of their performance. Several example applications are presented that greatly benefit from the AC hierarchy. This paper introduces three algorithms for constructing multiple levels of the hierarchy from an unstructured collection of processors.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1614</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1614</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Perturbation Scheme for Spherical Arrangements with Application to Molecular Modeling</field><field name="creator">Halperin, Dan</field><field name="description">We describe a software package for computing and manipulating the subdivision of a sphere by a collection of (not necessarily great) circles and for computing the boundary surface of the union of spheres.

At the core of the paper is a novel perturbation scheme to overcome degeneracies and precision problems in computing spherical arrangements while using floating point arithmetic. The scheme is relatively simple, it balances between the efficiency of computation and the magnitude of the perturbation, and it performs well in practice. In one O(n) time pass through the data, it perturbs the inputs necessary to insure no potential degeneracies and then passes the perturbed inputs on to the geometric algorithm. We report and discuss experimental results. Our package is a major component in a larger package aimed to support geometric queries on molecular models; it is currently employed by chemists working in "rational drug design." The spherical subdivisions are used to construct a geometric model of a molecule where each sphere represents an atom.

One can then use the images from both pairs combined to compute a dense depth map. The motion estimates between stereo pairs enable us to combine depth maps from all the pairs in the sequence to form an extended scene reconstruction and we show results from a real image sequence. The motion computation is a linear least squares computation using all the pixels in the image.

Aggregating the processors into groups is a useful paradigm for programming an amorphous computer because groups can be used for specialization, increased robustness, and efficient resource allocation. This paper presents a new algorithm, called the clubs algorithm, for efficiently aggregating processors into groups in an amorphous computer, in time proportional to the local density of processors. The clubs algorithm is well-suited to the unique characteristics of an amorphous computer. In addition, the algorithm derives two properties from the physical embedding of the amorphous computer: an upper bound on the number of groups formed and a constant upper bound on the density of groups. The clubs algorithm can also be extended to find the maximal independent set (MIS) and $Delta + 1$ vertex coloring in an amorphous computer in $O(log N)$ rounds, where $N$ is the total number of elements and $Delta$ is the maximum degree.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1626</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1626</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Binocular, Foveated Active Vision System</field><field name="creator">Scassellati, Brian</field><field name="description">This report documents the design and implementation of a binocular, foveated active vision system as part of the Cog project at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

We propose a novel model of fast learning that exploits the properties of sparse representations and the constraints imposed by a plausible hardware mechanism. To demonstrate our approach we describe a computational model of acquisition in the domain of morphophonology. We encapsulate phonological information as bidirectional boolean constraint relations operating on the classical linguistic representations of speech sounds in term of distinctive features. The performance model is described as a hardware mechanism that incrementally enforces the constraints. Phonological behavior arises from the action of this mechanism. Constraints are induced from a corpus of common English nouns and verbs. The induction algorithm compiles the corpus into increasingly sophisticated constraints. The algorithm yields one-shot learning from a few examples. Our model has been implemented as a computer program. The program exhibits phonological behavior similar to that of young children. As a bonus the constraints that are acquired can be interpreted as classical linguistic rules.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1633</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1633</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restructuring Sparse High Dimensional Data for Effective Retrieval</field><field name="creator">Isbell, Charles</field><field name="description">The task in text retrieval is to find the subset of  a collection of documents relevant to a user's  information request, usually expressed as a  set of words. Classically, documents and  queries are represented as vectors of word  counts. In its simplest form, relevance is  defined to be the dot product between a  document and a query vector--a measure of  the number of common terms. A central  difficulty in text retrieval is that the presence or  absence of a word is not sufficient to  determine relevance to a query. Linear  dimensionality reduction has been proposed  as a technique for extracting underlying  structure from the document collection. In  some domains (such as vision)  dimensionality reduction reduces  computational complexity. In text retrieval it is  more often used to improve retrieval  performance. We propose an alternative and  novel technique that produces sparse  representations constructed from sets of  highly-related words. Documents and queries  are represented by their distance to these  sets. and relevance is measured by the  number of common clusters. This technique  significantly improves retrieval performance,  is efficient to compute and shares properties  with the optimal linear projection operator and  the independent components of documents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1636</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1636</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Separating Reflections from Images Using Independent Components Analysis</field><field name="creator">Farid, Hany</field><field name="description">The image of an object can vary dramatically depending on lighting, specularities/reflections and shadows.

This paper tackles the problem of self-calibration of multiple cameras which are very far apart, using feature correspondences to determine the camera geometry. The key problem is finding such correspondences. Since the camera geometry and photometric characteristics vary considerably between images, one cannot use brightness and/or proximity constraints. Instead we apply planar geometric constraints to moving objects in the scene in order to align the scene"s ground plane across multiple views. We do not assume synchronized cameras, and we show that enforcing geometric constraints enables us to align the tracking data in time. Once we have recovered the homography which aligns the planar structure in the scene, we can compute from the homography matrix the 3D position of the plane and the relative camera positions. This in turn enables us to recover a homography matrix which maps the images to an overhead view. We demonstrate this technique in two settings: a controlled lab setting where we test the effects of errors in internal camera calibration, and an uncontrolled, outdoor setting in which the full procedure is applied to external camera calibration and ground plane recovery. In spite of noise in the internal camera parameters and image data, the system successfully recovers both planar structure and relative camera positions in both settings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1655</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1655</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detecting Digital Forgeries Using Bispectral Analysis</field><field name="creator">Farid, Hany</field><field name="description">With the rapid increase in low-cost and sophisticated digital technology the need for techniques to authenticate digital material will become more urgent.

The basic approach that we take is to assume that in the frequency domain a "natural" signal has weak higher-order statistical correlations. We then show that "un-natural" correlations are introduced if this signal is passed through a non-linearity (which would almost surely occur in the creation of a forgery). Techniques from polyspectral analysis are then used to detect the presence of these correlations. We review the basics of polyspectral analysis, show how and why these tools can be used in detecting forgeries and show their effectiveness in analyzing human speech.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1657</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1657</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stable Mixing of Complete and Incomplete Information</field><field name="creator">Corduneanu, Adrian</field><field name="description">An increasing number of parameter estimation tasks involve the use of at least two information sources, one complete but limited, the other abundant but incomplete.

Traditionally the answer to this question has  been sought in different problem solving  paradigms and in different approaches to  encoding and indexing knowledge. Each of  these is useful with a certain variety of  problem, but they all share a common  problem: they become ineffective in the face of  a sufficiently large knowledge base. How then  can we make it possible for a system to  continue to function in the face of a very large  number of plausibly useful chunks of  knowledge? In response to this question we  propose a framework for viewing issues of  knowledge indexing and retrieval, a  framework that includes what appears to be a  useful perspective on the concept of a  strategy. We view strategies as a means of  controlling invocation in situations where  traditional selection mechanisms become  ineffective. We examine ways to effect such  control, and describe meta-rules, a means of  specifying strategies which offers a number of  advantages. We consider at some length how  and when it is useful to reason about control,  and explore the advantages meta-rules offer  for doing this.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-576</field><field name="identifier">AIM-576</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative Inference in a Mechanical Design Compiler</field><field name="creator">Ward, Allen C.</field><field name="description">This paper presents the ideas underlying a  program that takes as input a schematic of a  mechanical or hydraulic power transmission  system, plus specifications and a utility  function, and returns catalog numbers from  predefined catalogs for the optimal selection  of components implementing the design.

For example, we may wish to recover  regulatory networks from high-throughput data sources. In this paper  we examine how Bayesian regularization using a Dirichlet prior over the  model parameters affects the learned model structure in a  domain with discrete variables. Surprisingly, a weak prior in the  sense of smaller equivalent sample size leads to a strong  regularization of the model structure (sparse graph) given a sufficiently  large data set. In particular, the empty graph is obtained in the  limit of a vanishing strength of prior belief. This is  diametrically opposite to what one may expect in this limit, namely the  complete graph from an (unregularized) maximum likelihood estimate.  Since the prior affects the parameters as expected, the prior strength  balances a "trade-off" between regularizing the parameters or the  structure of the model. We demonstrate the benefits of optimizing this  trade-off in the sense of predictive accuracy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2002-014</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Regularization</field><field name="subject">Dirichlet Prior</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2002-014</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovering Intrinsic Images from a Single Image</field><field name="creator">Tappen, Marshall F.</field><field name="description">We present an algorithm that uses multiple  cues to recover shading and reflectance intrinsic images from a single  image.

This method depends critically  on the choice of hash functions; we show how to find the set of hash  functions that are optimally relevant to a particular estimation problem.  Experiments demonstrate that the resulting algorithm, which we call Parameter-Sensitive Hashing, can rapidly and  accurately estimate the articulated pose of human figures from a large  database of example images.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2003-009</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">parameter estimation</field><field name="subject">nearest neighbor</field><field name="subject">locally weighted learning</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2003-009</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light Field Morphable Models</field><field name="creator">Christoudias, Chris Mario</field><field name="description">Statistical shape and texture appearance models are  powerful image representations, but previously had  been restricted to 2D or simple 3D shapes.

A number of projects around the world are constantly contributing ideas and solutions  that are bound to change the way we interact with our environments and with one another. An  essential component of the future is a software infrastructure that is capable of supporting interactions  on scales ranging from a single physical space to intercontinental collaborations. Such  infrastructure must help applications adapt to very diverse environments and must protect people's  privacy and respect their personal preferences. In this paper we indicate a number of limitations present  in the software infrastructures proposed so far (including our previous work). We then describe the  framework for building an infrastructure that satisfies the abovementioned criteria. This  framework hinges on the concepts of delegation, arbitration and high-level service discovery.

Developmental psychology and computational experience have demonstrated that the motion segmentation of objects is a simpler, more primitive process than the detection of object boundaries by static image cues. Therefore, motion information provides a plausible supervision signal for learning the static boundary detection task and for evaluating performance on a test set. A video camera and previously developed background subtraction algorithms can automatically produce a large database of motion-segmented images for minimal cost. The purpose of this work is to use the information in such a database to learn how to detect the object boundaries in novel images using static information, such as color, texture, and shape.

However, due to the complexity of computing the exact minimum cost matching, previous algorithms could only run efficiently when using a limited number of features per shape, and could not scale to perform retrievals from large databases. We present a contour matching algorithm that quickly computes the minimum weight matching between sets of descriptive local features using a recently introduced low-distortion embedding of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) into a normed space. Given a novel embedded contour, the nearest neighbors in a database of embedded contours are retrieved in sublinear time via approximate nearest neighbors search.

For a known object class, however, 3D shape can be successfully inferred from a single snapshot. We present a method for generating a ``virtual visual hull''-- an estimate of the 3D shape of an object from a known class, given a single silhouette observed from an unknown viewpoint. For a given class, a large database of multi-view silhouette examples from calibrated, though possibly varied, camera rigs are collected. To infer a novel single view input silhouette's virtual visual hull, we search for 3D shapes in the database which are most consistent with the observed contour. The input is matched to component single views of the multi-view training examples. A set of viewpoint-aligned virtual views are generated from the visual hulls corresponding to these examples. The 3D shape estimate for the input is then found by interpolating between the contours of these aligned views. When the underlying shape is ambiguous given a single view silhouette, we produce multiple visual hull hypotheses; if a sequence of input images is available, a dynamic programming approach is applied to find the maximum likelihood path through the feasible hypotheses over time. We show results of our algorithm on real and synthetic images of people.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-003</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">visual hulls</field><field name="subject">silhouettes</field><field name="subject">nearest neighbors</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-003</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sharing visual features for multiclass and multiview object detection</field><field name="creator">Torralba, Antonio</field><field name="description">We consider the problem of detecting a large number of different classes of objects in cluttered scenes. Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data, since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (run-time) computational complexity, and the (training-time) sample complexity, scales linearly with the number of classes to be detected. It seems unlikely that such an approach will scale up to allow recognition of hundreds or thousands of objects.  We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required, and therefore the computational cost, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected jointly are closer to edges and generic features typical of many natural structures instead of finding specific object parts. Those generic features generalize better and reduce considerably the computational cost of an algorithm for multi-class object detection.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-008</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Object detection</field><field name="subject">sharing features</field><field name="subject">feature selection</field><field name="subject">multiclass</field><field name="subject">Boosting</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-008</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextual Influences on Saliency</field><field name="creator">Torralba, Antonio</field><field name="description">This article describes a model for including scene/context priors in attention guidance.

For example, a person might want to return to Web content via a link encountered earlier on a Web page, only to learn that the link has since been removed. Changes can benefit users by providing new information, but they hinder returning to previously viewed information. The observational study presented here analyzed instances, collected via a Web search, where people expressed difficulty re-finding information because of changes to the information or its environment. A number of interesting observations arose from this analysis, including that the path originally taken to get to the information target appeared important in its re-retrieval, whereas, surprisingly, the temporal aspects of when the information was seen before were not. While people expressed frustration when problems arose, an explanation of why the change had occurred was often sufficient to allay that frustration, even in the absence of a solution. The implications of these observations for systems that support re-finding in dynamic environments are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-012</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">re-finding</field><field name="subject">information management</field><field name="subject">dynamic information</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-012</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextual models for object detection using boosted random fields</field><field name="creator">Torralba, Antonio</field><field name="description">We seek to both detect and segment objects in images.

A major  focus of computer vision (and recently  graphics) research is the automatic recovery  of three-dimensional models from two-dimensional images. After many years of  research this goal is yet to be achieved. Most  practical modeling systems require  substantial human input and unlike automatic  systems are not scalable. This thesis  presents a novel method for automatically  recovering dense surface patches using large  sets (1000's) of calibrated images taken from  arbitrary positions within the scene. Physical  instruments, such as Global Positioning  System (GPS), inertial sensors, and  inclinometers, are used to estimate the  position and orientation of each image.  Essentially, the problem is to find  corresponding points in each of the images.  Once a correspondence has been  established, calculating its three-dimensional  position is simply a matter of geometry. Long  baseline images improve the accuracy. Short  baseline images and the large number of  images greatly simplifies the correspondence  problem. The initial stage of the algorithm is  completely local and scales linearly with the  number of images. Subsequent stages are  global in nature, exploit geometric constraints,  and scale quadratically with the complexity of  the underlying scene. We describe  techniques for: 1) detecting and localizing  surface patches; 2) refining camera  calibration estimates and rejecting false  positive surfels; and 3) grouping surface  patches into surfaces and growing the  surface along a two-dimensional manifold.  We also discuss a method for producing high  quality, textured three-dimensional models  from these surfaces. Some of the most  important characteristics of this approach are  that it: 1) uses and refines noisy calibration  estimates; 2) compensates for large  variations in illumination; 3) tolerates  significant soft occlusion (e.g. tree branches);  and 4) associates, at a fundamental level, an  estimated normal (i.e. no frontal-planar  assumption) and texture with each surface  patch.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1674</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Computer Vision</field><field name="subject">Multi-camera Stereo</field><field name="subject">APGD</field><field name="subject">3D Reconstruction</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1674</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proceedings of the Second PHANToM User's Group Workshop</field><field name="creator">Salisbury, J.

Internet Fish (IFish) are semi-autonomous, persistent information brokers;  users deploy individual IFish to gather and  refine information related to a particular topic.  An IFish will initiate research, continue to  discover new sources of information, and  keep tabs on new developments in that topic.  As part of the information-gathering process  the user interacts with his IFish to find out  what it has learned, answer questions it has  posed, and make suggestions for guidance.  Internet Fish differ from other Internet  resource discovery systems in that they are  persistent, personal and dynamic. As part of  the information-gathering process IFish  conduct extended, long-term conversations  with users as they explore. They incorporate  deep structural knowledge of the organization  and services of the net, and are also capable  of on-the-fly reconfiguration, modification and  expansion. Human users may dynamically  change the IFish in response to changes in  the environment, or IFish may initiate such  changes itself. IFish maintain internal state,  including models of its own structure,  behavior, information environment and its  user; these models permit an IFish to perform  meta-level reasoning about its own structure.  To facilitate rapid assembly of particular IFish  I have created the Internet Fish Construction  Kit. This system provides enabling  technology for the entire class of Internet Fish  tools; it facilitates both creation of new IFish  as well as additions of new capabilities to  existing ones. The Construction Kit includes  a collection of encapsulated heuristic  knowledge modules that may be combined in  mix-and-match fashion to create a particular  IFish; interfaces to new services written with  the Construction Kit may be immediately  added to "live" IFish. Using the Construction  Kit I have created a demonstration IFish  specialized for finding World-Wide Web  documents related to a given group of  documents. This "Finder" IFish includes  heuristics that describe how to interact with  the Web in general, explain how to take  advantage of various public indexes and  classification schemes, and provide a method  for discovering similarity relationships among  documents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1579</field><field name="subject">automated resource discovery</field><field name="subject">semi-autonomous information retrieval</field><field name="subject">persistent information brokers</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1579</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analog VLSI Chip for Estimating the Focus of Expansion</field><field name="creator">McQuirk, Ignacio Sean</field><field name="description">For applications involving the control of  moving vehicles, the recovery of relative  motion between a camera and its  environment is of high utility. This thesis  describes the design and testing of a real-time analog VLSI chip which estimates the  focus of expansion (FOE) from measured  time-varying images. Our approach assumes  a camera moving through a fixed world with  translational velocity; the FOE is the projection  of the translation vector onto the image plane.  This location is the point towards which the  camera is moving, and other points appear to  be expanding outward from. By way of the  camera imaging parameters, the location of  the FOE gives the direction of 3-D translation.  The algorithm we use for estimating the FOE  minimizes the sum of squares of the  differences at every pixel between the  observed time variation of brightness and the  predicted variation given the assumed  position of the FOE. This minimization is not  straightforward, because the relationship  between the brightness derivatives depends  on the unknown distance to the surface being  imaged. However, image points where  brightness is instantaneously constant play a  critical role. Ideally, the FOE would be at the  intersection of the tangents to the iso-brightness contours at these "stationary"  points. In practice, brightness derivatives are  hard to estimate accurately given that the  image is quite noisy. Reliable results can  nevertheless be obtained if the image  contains many stationary points and the point  is found that minimizes the sum of squares of  the perpendicular distances from the tangents  at the stationary points. The FOE chip  calculates the gradient of this least-squares  minimization sum, and the estimation is  performed by closing a feedback loop around  it. The chip has been implemented using an  embedded CCD imager for image acquisition  and a row-parallel processing scheme. A 64  x 64 version was fabricated in a 2um CCD/ BiCMOS process through MOSIS with a  design goal of 200 mW of on-chip power, a  top frame rate of 1000 frames/second, and a  basic accuracy of 5%. A complete  experimental system which estimates the  FOE in real time using real motion and image  scenes is demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1577</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Machine Vision</field><field name="subject">sMotion Vision</field><field name="subject">Focus of Expansion</field><field name="subject">Analog VLSI</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1577</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pose-Invariant Face Recognition Using Real and Virtual Views</field><field name="creator">Beymer, David</field><field name="description">The problem of automatic face recognition is  to visually identify a person in an input image.  This task is performed by matching the input  face against the faces of known people in a  database of faces. Most existing work in face  recognition has limited the scope of the  problem, however, by dealing primarily with  frontal views, neutral expressions, and fixed  lighting conditions. To help generalize  existing face recognition systems, we look at  the problem of recognizing faces under a  range of viewpoints. In particular, we consider  two cases of this problem: (i) many example  views are available of each person, and (ii)  only one view is available per person,  perhaps a driver's license or passport  photograph. Ideally, we would like to address  these two cases using a simple view-based  approach, where a person is represented in  the database by using a number of views on  the viewing sphere. While the view-based  approach is consistent with case (i), for case  (ii) we need to augment the single real view of  each person with synthetic views from other  viewpoints, views we call 'virtual views'. Virtual  views are generated using prior knowledge of  face rotation, knowledge that is 'learned' from  images of prototype faces. This prior  knowledge is used to effectively rotate in  depth the single real view available of each  person. In this thesis, I present the view-based face recognizer, techniques for  synthesizing virtual views, and experimental  results using real and virtual views in the  recognizer.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1574</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">sface recognition</field><field name="subject">facial feature detection</field><field name="subject">virtualsviews</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1574</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6772</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SketchIT: A Sketch Interpretation Tool for Conceptual Mechanical Design</field><field name="creator">Stahovich, Thomas F.</field><field name="description">We describe a program called SketchIT  capable of producing multiple families of  designs from a single sketch. The program is  given a rough sketch (drawn using line  segments for part faces and icons for springs  and kinematic joints) and a description of the  desired behavior. The sketch is "rough" in the  sense that taken literally, it may not work.  From this single, perhaps flawed sketch and  the behavior description, the program  produces an entire family of working designs.  The program also produces design variants,  each of which is itself a family of designs.  SketchIT represents each family of designs  with a "behavior ensuring parametric model"  (BEP-Model), a parametric model augmented  with a set of constraints that ensure the  geometry provides the desired behavior. The  construction of the BEP-Model from the sketch  and behavior description is the primary task  and source of difficulty in this undertaking.  SketchIT begins by abstracting the sketch to  produce a qualitative configuration space (qc-space) which it then uses as its primary  representation of behavior. SketchIT modifies  this initial qc-space until qualitative simulation  verifies that it produces the desired behavior.   SketchIT's task is then to find geometries that  implement this qc-space. It does this using a  library of qc-space fragments. Each fragment  is a piece of parametric geometry with a set of  constraints that ensure the geometry  implements a specific kind of boundary (qcs-curve) in qc-space. SketchIT assembles the  fragments to produce the BEP-Model.  SketchIT produces design variants by  mapping the qc-space to multiple  implementations, and by transforming rotating  parts to translating parts and vice versa.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1573</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Geometric Reasoning</field><field name="subject">Qualitative Simulation</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1573</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and Example Selection for Object and Pattern Detection</field><field name="creator">Sung, Kah-Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a learning based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. It consists of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model. The approach makes few assumptions about the target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target class has predictable image boundaries. Because our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based, how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. We propose an {em active learning} formulation for function approximation, and show for three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. We then simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern detection problems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1572</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Computer Vision</field><field name="subject">Face Detection</field><field name="subject">Object Detection</field><field name="subject">Example-based Learning</field><field name="subject">Active Learning</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1572</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Fixation and Visual Attention in Object Recognition</field><field name="creator">Ratan, Aparna Lakshmi</field><field name="description">This research project is a study of the role of  fixation and visual attention in object  recognition. In this project, we build an active  vision system which can recognize a target  object in a cluttered scene efficiently and  reliably. Our system integrates visual cues  like color and stereo to perform figure/ground  separation, yielding candidate regions on  which to focus attention. Within each image  region, we use stereo to extract features that  lie within a narrow disparity range about the  fixation position. These selected features are  then used as input to an alignment-style  recognition system. We show that visual  attention and fixation significantly reduce the  complexity and the false identifications in  model-based recognition using Alignment  methods. We also demonstrate that stereo  can be used effectively as a figure/ground  separator without the need for accurate  camera calibration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1529</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Computer Vision</field><field name="subject">Object Recognitions</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1529</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Series Elastic Actuators</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Matthew M.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the design, construction,  control and evaluation of a novel force  controlled actuator.

Previous  approaches to learning causal world models  have concentrated on environments that are  too "easy" (deterministic finite state  machines) or too "hard" (containing much  hidden state). We describe a new domain --- environments with manifest causal structure --- for learning. In such environments the  agent has an abundance of perceptions of its  environment. Specifically, it perceives almost  all the relevant information it needs to  understand the environment. Many  environments of interest have manifest causal  structure and we show that an agent can learn  the manifest aspects of these environments  quickly using straightforward learning  techniques. We present a new algorithm to  learn a rule-based causal world model from  observations in the environment. The  learning algorithm includes (1) a low level  rule-learning algorithm that converges on a  good set of specific rules, (2) a concept  learning algorithm that learns concepts by  finding completely correlated perceptions, and  (3) an algorithm that learns general rules. In  addition this thesis examines the problem of  finding a good expert from a sequence of  experts. Each expert has an "error rate"; we  wish to find an expert with a low error rate.  However, each expert's error rate and the  distribution of error rates are unknown. A new  expert-finding algorithm is presented and an  upper bound on the expected error rate of the  expert is derived.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1513</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">intelligent agents</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1513</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing 3-D Motion in Custom Analog and Digital VLSI</field><field name="creator">Dron, Lisa</field><field name="description">This thesis examines a complete design  framework for a real-time, autonomous  system with specialized VLSI hardware for  computing 3-D camera motion.

I will argue  that a variety of interesting tasks can be  solved using simple and inexpensive vision  systems. I will provide a number of working  examples in the form of a state-of-the-art  mobile robot, Polly, which uses vision to give  primitive tours of the seventh floor of the MIT AI  Laboratory. By current standards, the robot  has a broad behavioral repertoire and is both  simple and inexpensive (the complete robot  was built for less than $20,000 using  commercial board-level components). The  approach I will use will be to treat the structure  of the agent's activity---its task and  environment---as positive resources for the  vision system designer. By performing a  careful analysis of task and environment, the  designer can determine a broad space of  mechanisms which can perform the desired  activity. My principal thesis is that for a broad  range of activities, the space of applicable  mechanisms will be broad enough to include  a number mechanisms which are simple and  economical. The simplest mechanisms that  solve a given problem will typically be quite  specialized to that problem. One thus worries  that building simple vision systems will be  require a great deal of {it ad-hoc} engineering  that cannot be transferred to other problems.  My second thesis is that specialized systems  can be analyzed and understood in a  principled manner, one that allows general  lessons to be extracted from specialized  systems. I will present a general approach to  analyzing specialization through the use of  transformations that provably improve  performance. By demonstrating a sequence  of transformations that derive a specialized  system from a more general one, we can  summarize the specialization of the former in  a compact form that makes explicit the  additional assumptions that it makes about  its environment. The summary can be used  to predict the performance of the system in  novel environments. Individual  transformations can be recycled in the design  of future systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1511</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">behavior-based systems</field><field name="subject">agents</field><field name="subject">real-time</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1511</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Named-State Register File</field><field name="creator">Nuth, Peter R.</field><field name="description">This thesis introduces the Named-State  Register File, a fine-grain, fully-associative  register file.

In  this thesis, we propose a novel feature  extraction paradigm. The features consist of  salient, simple parts of regions bounded by  zero-crossings. The features are dense,  stable, and robust. The primary advantage of  the features is that they have abstract  geometric attributes pertaining to their size  and shape.

Structure information is recovered from  images continuously using shading, motion  or other visual mechanisms. A Kalman filter  represents structure in a dense depth map.  With each new image, the filter first updates  the current depth map by a minimum variance  estimate that best fits the new image data and  the previous estimate. Then the structure  estimate is predicted for the next time step by  a transformation that accounts for relative  camera motion. Experimental evaluation  shows the significant improvement in quality  and computation time that can be achieved  using this technique.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1296</field><field name="subject">3D reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Kalman Filter</field><field name="subject">temporal vision</field><field name="subject">structuresestimation</field><field name="subject">surface reconstruction</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1296</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reliable Interconnection Networks for Parallel Computers</field><field name="creator">Dennison, Larry R.</field><field name="description">This technical report describes a new  protocol, the Unique Token Protocol, for  reliable message communication.

The first question is what joint time-frequency  energy representations are most appropriate  for auditory signals, in particular, for speech  signals in sonorant regions. The quadratic  transforms of the signal are examined, a large  class that includes, for example, the  spectrograms and the Wigner distribution.  Quasi-stationarity is not assumed, since this  would neglect dynamic regions. A set of  desired properties is proposed for the  representation: (1) shift-invariance, (2)  positivity, (3) superposition, (4) locality, and (5)  smoothness. Several relations among these  properties are proved: shift-invariance and  positivity imply the transform is a  superposition of spectrograms; positivity and  superposition are equivalent conditions when  the transform is real; positivity limits the  simultaneous time and frequency resolution  (locality) possible for the transform, defining  an uncertainty relation for joint time-frequency  energy representations; and locality and  smoothness tradeoff by the 2-D generalization  of the classical uncertainty relation. The  transform that best meets these criteria is  derived, which consists of two-dimensionally  smoothed Wigner distributions with (possibly  oriented) 2-D guassian kernels. These  transforms are then related to time-frequency  filtering, a method for estimating the time-varying 'transfer function' of the vocal tract,  which is somewhat analogous to ceptstral  filtering generalized to the time-varying case.  Natural speech examples are provided. The  second question addressed is how to obtain  a rich, symbolic description of the phonetically  relevant features in these time-frequency  energy surfaces, the so-called schematic  spectrogram. Time-frequency ridges, the 2-D  analog of spectral peaks, are one feature that  is proposed. If non-oriented kernels are used  for the energy representation, then the ridge  tops can be identified, with zero-crossings in  the inner product of the gradient vector and the  direction of greatest downward curvature. If  oriented kernels are used, the method can be  generalized to give better orientation selectivity  (e.g., at intersecting ridges) at the cost of  poorer time-frequency locality. Many speech  examples are given showing the performance  for some traditionally difficult cases: semi-vowels and glides, nasalized vowels,  consonant-vowel transitions, female speech,  and imperfect transmission channels.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-974</field><field name="identifier">AITR-974</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and Evaluation of the Hamal Parallel Computer</field><field name="creator">Grossman, J.P.</field><field name="description">Parallel shared-memory machines with hundreds or thousands of processor-memory nodes have been built; in the future we will see machines with millions or  even billions of nodes. Associated with such large systems is a new set of  design challenges. Many problems must be addressed by an architecture in  order for it to be successful; of these, we focus on three in particular.  First, a scalable memory system is required. Second, the network messaging  protocol must be fault-tolerant. Third, the overheads of thread creation,  thread management and synchronization must be extremely low.  This thesis presents the complete system design for Hamal, a shared-memory  architecture which addresses these concerns and is directly scalable to one  million nodes. Virtual memory and distributed objects are implemented in a  manner that requires neither inter-node synchronization nor the storage of  globally coherent translations at each node. We develop a lightweight  fault-tolerant messaging protocol that guarantees message delivery and  idempotence across a discarding network. A number of hardware mechanisms  provide efficient support for massive multithreading and fine-grained  synchronization.  Experiments are conducted in simulation, using a trace-driven network  simulator to investigate the messaging protocol and a cycle-accurate simulator to evaluate the Hamal architecture. We determine implementation parameters  for the messaging protocol which optimize performance. A discarding network  is easier to design and can be clocked at a higher rate, and we find that with this protocol its performance can approach that of a non-discarding network.  Our simulations of Hamal demonstrate the effectiveness of its thread  management and synchronization primitives. In particular, we find  register-based synchronization to be an extremely efficient mechanism which  can be used to implement a software barrier with a latency of only 523 cycles on a 512 node machine.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2002-011</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">parallel</field><field name="subject">network</field><field name="subject">simulation</field><field name="subject">hashing</field><field name="subject">multithreading</field><field name="subject">synchronization</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2002-011</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual Navigation: Constructing and Utilizing Simple Maps of an Indoor Environment</field><field name="creator">Sarachik, Karen Beth</field><field name="description">The goal of this work is to navigate through an  office environmentsusing only visual  information gathered from four cameras  placed onboard a mobile robot.

This work presents a method to shape force  profiles that reduce excitation energy at the  natural frequencies in order to reduce  residual vibration for fast moves. Such  profiles are developed using a ramped  sinusoid function and its harmonics,  choosing coefficients to reduce spectral  energy at the natural frequencies of the  system. To improve robustness with respect  to parameter uncertainty, spectral energy is  reduced for a range of frequencies  surrounding the nominal natural frequency.  An additional set of versine profiles are also  constructed to permit motion at constant  speed for velocity-limited systems. These  shaped force profiles are incorporated into a  simple closed-loop system with position and  velocity feedback. The force input is doubly  integrated to generate a shaped position  reference for the controller to follow. This  control scheme is evaluated on the MIT  Cartesian Robot. The shaped inputs  generate motions with minimum residual  vibration when actuator saturation is avoided.  Feedback control compensates for the effect  of friction Using only a knowledge of the  natural frequencies of the system to shape  the force inputs, vibration can also be  attenuated in modes which vibrate in  directions other than the motion direction.  When moving several axes, the use of shaped  inputs allows minimum residual vibration  even when the natural frequencies are  dynamically changing by a limited amount.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1018</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">vibration</field><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1018</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residual Vibration Reduction in Computer Controlled Machines</field><field name="creator">Singer, Neil C.</field><field name="description">Control of machines that exhibit flexibility  becomes important when designers attempt  to push the state of the art with faster, lighter  machines. Three steps are necessary for the  control of a flexible planet. First, a good  model of the plant must exist. Second, a good  controller must be designed. Third, inputs to  the controller must be constructed using  knowledge of the system dynamic response.  There is a great deal of literature pertaining to  modeling and control but little dealing with the  shaping of system inputs. Chapter 2  examines two input shaping techniques  based on frequency domain analysis. The  first involves the use of the first deriviate of a  gaussian exponential as a driving function  template. The second, acasual filtering,  involves removal of energy from the driving  functions at the resonant frequencies of the  system. Chapter 3 presents a linear  programming technique for generating  vibration-reducing driving functions for  systems. Chapter 4 extends the results of the  previous chapter by developing a direct  solution to the new class of driving functions.  A detailed analysis of the new technique is  presented from five different perspectives and  several extensions are presented.  Chapter 5  verifies the theories of the previous two  chapters with hardware experiments.  Because the new technique resembles  common signal filtering, chapter 6 compares  the new approach to eleven standard filters.  The new technique will be shown to result in  less residual vibrations, have better  robustness to system parameter uncertainty,  and require less computation than other  currently used shaping techniques.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1030</field><field name="subject">vibrations</field><field name="subject">oscillations</field><field name="subject">teleoperators</field><field name="subject">flexible manipulators</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1030</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computation and Pre-Parametric Design</field><field name="creator">Ulrich, Karl T.</field><field name="description">My work is broadly concerned with the  question "How can designs bessynthesized  computationally?"

This thesis explains  the theoretical basis for each technique,  describes how they are implemented, and  discusses the difference between the two.  DQ analysis is sound; it never generates an  incorrect answer to a comparative analysis  question.

The  selected space pruning constraints are then  used to reduce the search space and the  sampling is repeated. This approach can be  used either to verify whether some set of  space pruning constraints can prune with  discrimination or to generate solutions  directly. Schedules can be represented as  trajectories through a Cartesian space.  Under the objective criteria of Minimum  maximum Lateness family of "good"  schedules (trajectories) are geometric  neighbors (reside with some "tube") in this  space. This second method of generating  solutions takes advantage of this adjacency  by pruning the space from the outside in thus  converging gradually upon this "tube."

Sensory  feedback is critical or full utilization of its  advanced manipulatory capabilities. The hand  itself provides tendon tensions and joint  angles information. However, planned control  algorithms require more information than  these sources can provide. The tactile sensor  utilizes capacitive transduction with a novel  design based entirely on silicone elastomers.  It provides an 8 x 8 array of force cells with 1.9  mm center-to-center spacing. A pressure  resolution of 8 significant bits is available over  a 0 to 200 grams per square mm range. The  thermal sensor measures a material's heat  conductivity by radiating heat into an object  and measuring the resulting temperature  variations. This sensor has a 4 x 4 array of  temperature cells with 3.5 mm center-to-center spacing. Experiments show that the  thermal sensor can discriminate among  material by detecting differences in their  thermal conduction properties. Both sensors  meet the stringent mounting requirements  posed by the Utah-MIT hand. Combining them  together to form a sensor with both tactile and  thermal capabilities will ultimately be  possible. The computational requirements for  controlling a sensor equipped dexterous hand  are severe. Conventional single processor  computers do not provide adequate  performance. To overcome these difficulties, a  computational architecture based on  interconnecting high performance  microcomputers and a set of software  primitives tailored for sensor driven control  has been proposed. The system has been  implemented and tested on the Utah-MIT  hand. The hand, equipped with tactile and  thermal sensors and controlled by its  computational architecture, is one of the most  advanced robotic manipulatory devices  available worldwide. Other ongoing projects  will exploit these tools and allow the hand to  perform tasks that exceed the capabilities of  current generation robots.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-900</field><field name="identifier">AITR-900</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Synthesis of Stable Force-Closure Grasps</field><field name="creator">Nguyen</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of  synthesizing grasps that are force-closure  and stable. The synthesis of force-closure  grasps constructs independent regions of  contact for the fingertips, such that the motion  of the grasped object is totally constrained.  The synthesis of stable grasps constructs  virtual springs at the contacts, such that the  grasped object is stable, and has a desired  stiffness matrix about its stable equilibrium.  A grasp on an object is force-closure if and  only if we can exert, through the set of  contacts, arbitrary forces and moments on the  object. So force-closure implies equilibrium  exists because zero forces and moment is  spanned. In the reverse direction, we prove  that a non-marginal equilibrium grasp is also  a force-closure grasp, if it has at least two  point contacts with friction in 2D, or two soft-finger contacts or three hard-finger contacts in  3D.  Next, we prove that all force-closure grasps  can be made stable, by using either active or  passive springs at the contacts. The thesis  develops a simple relation between the  stability and stiffness of the grasp and the  spatial configuration of the virtual springs at  the contacts. The stiffness of the grasp  depends also on whether the points of contact  stick, or slide without friction on straight or  curved surfaces of the object.  The thesis presents fast and simple  algorithms for directly constructing stable fore-closure grasps based on the shape of the  grasped object. The formal framework of  force-closure and stable grasps provides a  partial explanation to why we stably grasp  objects to easily, and to why our fingers are  better soft than hard.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-905</field><field name="identifier">AITR-905</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning by Failing to Explain</field><field name="creator">Hall, Robert Joseph</field><field name="description">Explanation-based Generalization requires  that the learner obtain an explanation of why a  precedent exemplifies a concept.

Some of the manipulator operations studied are: (1) Grasping an object. The object will usually slide and rotate during the period between first contact and prehension. (2) Placing an object. The object may slip slightly in the fingers upon contact with the table as the base aligns with the table. (3) Pushing. Often the final stage of mating two parts involves pushing one object into the other.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-690</field><field name="identifier">AITR-690</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image Chunking: Defining Spatial Building Blocks for Scene Analysis</field><field name="creator">Mahoney, James V.</field><field name="description">Rapid judgments about the properties and  spatial relations of objects are the crux of  visually guided interaction with the world.  Vision begins, however, with essentially  pointwise representations of the scene, such  as arrays of pixels or small edge fragments.  For adequate time-performance in  recognition, manipulation, navigation, and  reasoning, the processes that extract  meaningful entities from the pointwise  representations must exploit parallelism.  This report develops a framework for the fast  extraction of scene entities, based on a  simple, local model of parallel  computation.sAn image chunk is a subset of  an image that can act as a unit in the course  of spatial analysis. A parallel preprocessing  stage constructs a variety of simple chunks  uniformly over the visual array. On the basis  of these chunks, subsequent serial  processes locate relevant scene components  and assemble detailed descriptions of them  rapidly. This thesis defines image chunks  that facilitate the most potentially time-consuming operations of spatial analysis---boundary tracing, area coloring, and the  selection of locations at which to apply  detailed analysis. Fast parallel processes for  computing these chunks from images, and  chunk-based formulations of indexing, tracing,  and coloring, are presented. These  processes have been simulated and  evaluated on the lisp machine and the  connection machine.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-980</field><field name="subject">machine vision</field><field name="subject">chunking</field><field name="subject">segmentation</field><field name="subject">tracing</field><field name="subject">blobsdetection</field><field name="subject">image understanding</field><field name="subject">visual routines</field><field name="subject">region growing</field><field name="identifier">AITR-980</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ARLO: Another Representation Language Offer</field><field name="creator">Haase, Kenneth W., Jr.</field><field name="description">This paper describes ARLO, a representation  language loosely modelled after Greiner and  Lenant's RLL-1. ARLO is a structure-based  representation language for describing  structure-based representation languages,  including itself. A given representation  language is specified in ARLO by a collection  of structures describing how its descriptions  are interpreted, defaulted, and verified. This  high level description is compiles into lisp  code and ARLO structures whose  interpretation fulfills the specified semantics  of the representation. In addition, ARLO itself- as a representation language for expressing  and compiling partial and complete language  specifications- is described and interpreted in  the same manner as the language it  describes and implements. This self-description can be extended of modified to  expand or alter the expressive power of  ARLO's initial configuration. Languages  which describe themselves like ARLO- provide powerful mediums for systems which  perform automatic self-modification,  optimization, debugging, or documentation.

Automating this  recognition process will make it easier to  perform many tasks which require program  understanding, e.g., maintenance,  modification, and debugging. This report  describes a recognition system, called the  Recognizer, which automatically identifies  occurrences of stereotyped computational  fragments and data structures in programs.  The Recognizer is able to identify these  familiar fragments and structures, even  though they may be expressed in a wide  range of syntactic forms. It does so  systematically and efficiently by using a  parsing technique. Two important advances  have made this possible.

The programming  system can be used to construct strategies  consisting of compliant motions, in which a  moving robot slides along obstacles in its  environment. The programming system is  referred to as high level because the user is  spared of many robot-level details, such as  the specification of conditional tests, motion  termination conditions, and compliance  parameters. Instead, the user specifies task-level information, including a geometric model  of the robot and its environment. The user  may also have to specify some suggested  motions.  There are two main system components. The  first component is an interactive teaching  system which accepts motion commands  from a user and attempts to build a compliant  motion strategy using the specified motions  as building blocks. The second component is  an autonomous compliant motion planner,  which is intended to spare the user from  dealing with "simple" problems. The planner  simplifies the representation of the  environment by decomposing the  configuration space of the robot into a finite  state space, whose states are vertices,  edges, faces, and combinations thereof.  States are inked to each other by arcs, which  represent reliable compliant motions. Using  best first search, states are expanded until a  strategy is found from the start state to a  global state. This component represents one  of the first implemented compliant motion  planners.  The programming system has been  implemented on a Symbolics 3600 computer,  and tested on several examples. One of the  resulting compliant motion strategies was  successfully executed on an IBM 7565 robot  manipulator.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-936</field><field name="subject">motion planning</field><field name="subject">mechanical assembly</field><field name="subject">parts mating</field><field name="subject">srobotics</field><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">guiding</field><field name="identifier">AITR-936</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of Knowledge in Motor Learning</field><field name="creator">Atkeson, Christopher Granger</field><field name="description">The goal of this thesis is to apply the  computational approach to motor learning,  i.e., describe the constraints that enable  performance improvement with experience  and also the constraints that must be  satisfied by a motor learning system, describe  what is being computed in order to achieve  learning, and why it is being computed. The  particular tasks used to assess motor  learning are loaded and unloaded free arm  movement, and the thesis includes work on  rigid body load estimation, arm model  estimation, optimal filtering for model  parameter estimation, and trajectory learning  from practice. Learning algorithms have been  developed and implemented in the context of  robot arm control. The thesis demonstrates  some of the roles of knowledge in learning.  Powerful generalizations can be made on the  basis of knowledge of system structure, as is  demonstrated in the load and arm model  estimation algorithms. Improving the  performance of parameter estimation  algorithms used in learning involves  knowledge of the measurement noise  characteristics, as is shown in the derivation  of optimal filters. Using trajectory errors to  correct commands requires knowledge of  how command errors are transformed into  performance errors, i.e., an accurate model of  the dynamics of the controlled system, as is  demonstrated in the trajectory learning work.  The performance demonstrated by the  algorithms developed in this thesis should be  compared with algorithms that use less  knowledge, such as table based schemes to  learn arm dynamics, previous single trajectory  learning algorithms, and much of traditional  adaptive control.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-942</field><field name="subject">motor control</field><field name="subject">motor learning</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">robotics</field><field name="subject">ssystem identification</field><field name="identifier">AITR-942</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6858</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Coupled Depth/Slope Approach to Surface Reconstruction</field><field name="creator">Harris, John G.</field><field name="description">Reconstructing a surface from sparse  sensory data is a well known problem in  computer vision. Early vision modules  typically supply sparse depth, orientation and  discontinuity information. The surface  reconstruction module incorporates these  sparse and possibly conflicting  measurements of a surface into a consistent,  dense depth map. The coupled depth/slope  model developed here provides a novel  computational solution to the surface  reconstruction problem. This method  explicitly computes dense slope  representation as well as dense depth  representations. This marked change from  previous surface reconstruction algorithms  allows a natural integration of orientation  constraints into the surface description, a  feature not easily incorporated into earlier  algorithms. In addition, the coupled depth/ slope model generalizes to allow for varying  amounts of smoothness at different locations  on the surface.  This computational model helps  conceptualize the problem and leads to two  possible implementations- analog and digital.  The model can be implemented as an  electrical or biological analog network since  the only computations required at each locally  connected node are averages, additions and  subtractions. A parallel digital algorithm can  be derived by using finite difference  approximations. The resulting system of  coupled equations can be solved iteratively on  a mesh-pf-processors computer, such as the  Connection Machine. Furthermore,  concurrent multi-grid methods are designed  to speed the convergence of this digital  algorithm.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-908</field><field name="identifier">AITR-908</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated Assembly Using Feature Localization</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Steven Jeffrey</field><field name="description">Automated assembly of mechanical devices  is studies by researching methods of  operating assembly equipment in a variable  manner; that is, systems which may be  configured to perform many different  assembly operations are studied. The  general parts assembly operation involves the  removal of alignment errors within some  tolerance and without damaging the parts.  Two methods for eliminating alignment errors  are discussed: a priori suppression and  measurement and removal. Both methods  are studied with the more novel measurement  and removal technique being studied in  greater detail. During the study of this  technique, a fast and accurate six degree-of-freedom position sensor based on a light-stripe vision technique was developed.  Specifications for the sensor were derived  from an assembly-system error analysis.  Studies on extracting accurate information  from the sensor by optimally reducing  redundant information, filtering quantization  noise, and careful calibration procedures  were performed. Prototype assembly systems  for both error elimination techniques were  implemented and used to assemble several  products. The assembly system based on the  a priori suppression technique uses a  number of mechanical assembly tools and  software systems which extend the  capabilities of industrial robots. The need for  the tools was determined through an  assembly task analysis of several consumer  and automotive products. The assembly  system based on the measurement and  removal technique used the six degree-of-freedom position sensor to measure part  misalignments. Robot commands for aligning  the parts were automatically calculated based  on the sensor data and executed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-932</field><field name="identifier">AITR-932</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shape from Contour</field><field name="creator">Witkin, Andrew P.</field><field name="description">The problem of using image contours to infer  the shapes and orientations of surfaces is  treated as a problem of statistical estimation.  The basis for solving this problem lies in an  understanding of the geometry of contour  formation, coupled with simple statistical  models of the contour generating process.  This approach is first applied to the special  case of surfaces known to be planar. The  distortion of contour shape imposed by  projection is treated as a signal to be  estimated, and variations of non-projective  origin are treated as noise. The resulting  method is then extended to the estimation of  curved surfaces, and applied successfully to  natural images. Next, the geometric treatment  is further extended by relating countour  curvature to surface curvature, using cast  shadows as a model for contour generation.  This geometric relation, combined with a  statistical model, provides a measure of  goodness-of-fit between a surface and an  image contour. The goodness-of-fit measure  is applied to the problem of establishing  registration between an image and a surface  model. Finally, the statistical estimation  strategy is experimentally compared to human  perception of orientation: human observers'  judgements of tilt correspond closely to the  estimates produced by the planar strategy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-589</field><field name="identifier">AITR-589</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherent Behavior from Incoherent Knowledge Sources in the Automatic Synthesis of Numerical Computer Programs</field><field name="creator">Brown, Richard</field><field name="description">A fundamental problem in artificial intelligence  is obtaining coherent behavior in rule-based  problem solving systems.

This work studies the  qualitative and geometric knowledge required  to reason in a world that consists of balls  moving through space constrained by  collisions with surfaces, including dissipative  forces and multiple moving objects. An analog  geometry representation serves the program  as a diagram, allowing many spatial  questions to be answered by numeric  calculation. It also provides the foundation for  the construction and use of place vocabulary,  the symbolic descriptions of space required to  do qualitative reasoning about motion in the  domain. The actual motion of a ball is  described as a network consisting of  descriptions of qualitatively distinct types of  motion. Implementing the elements of these  networks in a constraint language allows the  same elements to be used for both analysis  and simulation of motion. A qualitative  description of the actual motion is also used  to check the consistency of assumptions  about motion. A process of qualitative  simulation is used to describe the kinds of  motion possible from some state. The  ambiguity inherent in such a description can  be reduced by assumptions about physical  properties of the ball or assumptions about its  motion. Each assumption directly rules out  some kinds of motion, but other knowledge is  required to determine the indirect  consequences of making these assumptions.  Some of this knowledge is domain dependent  and relies heavily on spatial descriptions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-615</field><field name="identifier">AITR-615</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Computer Games to Facilitate Learning</field><field name="creator">White, Barbara Y.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to explore the  design of interactive computer learning  environments.

This report describes the design and implementation of one part of a geologic interpretation problem solver -- a system which uses a simulation technique called imagining to check the validity of a candidate sequence of events. Imagining uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative simulations to reason about the changes which occured to the geologic region. The spatial changes which occur are simulated by constructing a sequence of diagrams. The quantitative simulation needs numeric parameters which are determined by using the qualitative simulation to establish the cumulative changes to an object and by using a description of the current geologic region to make quantitative measurements. The diversity of reasoning skills used in imagining has necessitated the development of multiple representations, each specialized for a different task. Representations to facilitate doing temporal, spatial and numeric reasoning are described in detail. We have also found it useful to explicitly represent processes. Both the qualitative and quantitative simulations use a discrete 'layer cake' model of geologic processes, but each uses a separate representation, specialized to support the type of simulation. These multiple representations have enabled us to develop a powerful, yet modular, system for reasoning about change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-749</field><field name="identifier">AITR-749</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface Perception from Local Analysis of Texture and Contour</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Kent A.</field><field name="description">The visual analysis of surface shape from  texture and surface contour is treated within a  computational framework.

The goal of this work is to demonstrate the generality and practical value of a probabilistic (in particular, Bayesian) approach to this problem, particularly in the context of Computer Vision. In this approach, the prior knowledge about the solution is expressed in the form of a Gibbsian probability distribution on the space of all possible functions, so that the reconstruction task is formulated as an estimation problem. Our main contributions are the following: (1) We introduce the use of specific error criteria for the design of the optimal Bayesian estimators for several classes of problems, and propose a general (Monte Carlo) procedure for approximating them. This new approach leads to a substantial improvement over the existing schemes, both regarding the quality of the results (particularly for low signal to noise ratios) and the computational efficiency. (2) We apply the Bayesian appraoch to the solution of several problems, some of which are formulated and solved in these terms for the first time. Specifically, these applications are: teh reconstruction of piecewise constant surfaces from sparse and noisy observationsl; the reconstruction of depth from stereoscopic pairs of images and the formation of perceptual clusters. (3) For each one of these applications, we develop fast, deterministic algorithms that approximate the optimal estimators, and illustrate their performance on both synthetic and real data. (4) We propose a new method, based on the analysis of the residual process, for estimating the parameters of the probabilistic models directly from the noisy observations. This scheme leads to an algorithm, which has no free parameters, for the restoration of piecewise uniform images. (5) We analyze the implementation of the algorithms that we develop in non-conventional hardware, such as massively parallel digital machines, and analog and hybrid networks.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-860</field><field name="subject">inverse problems</field><field name="subject">computer vision</field><field name="subject">surface interpolation</field><field name="subject">simage restoration</field><field name="subject">Markov random fields</field><field name="subject">optimal estimation</field><field name="subject">simulated annealing</field><field name="identifier">AITR-860</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative Analysis of MOS Circuits</field><field name="creator">Williams, Brian C.</field><field name="description">With the push towards sub-micron  technology, transistor models have become  increasingly complex.

To understand common sense  physical reasoning and make programs that  interact with the physical world as well as  people do we must understand qualitative  reasoning about processes, when they will  occur, their effects, and when they will stop.  Qualitative Process theory defines a simple  notion of physical process that appears useful  as a language in which to write dynamical  theories. Reasoning about processes also  motivates a new qualitative representation for  quantity in terms of inequalities, called  quantity space. This report describes the  basic concepts of Qualitative Process theory,  several different kinds of reasoning that can  be performed with them, and discusses its  impact on other issues in common sense  reasoning about the physical world, such as  causal reasoning and measurement  interpretation. Several extended examples  illustrate the utility of the theory, including  figuring out that a boiler can blow up, that an  oscillator with friction will eventually stop, and  how to say that you can pull with a string but  not push with it.

The goal behind the  construction of the system is that, whenever  faced with a choice, it should sensibly choose  between alternatives based upon the  description of the film and as much general  knowledge as possible. The system is  presented as a computational model of  creativity and aesthetics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-540</field><field name="identifier">AITR-540</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reasoning Modeled as a Society of Communicating Experts</field><field name="creator">Steels, Luc</field><field name="description">This report describes a domain independent  reasoning system. The system uses a frame-based knowledge representation language  and various reasoning techniques including  constraint propagation, progressive  refinement, natural deduction and explicit  control of reasoning. A computational  architecture based on active objects which  operate by exchanging messages is  developed and it is shown how this  architecture supports reasoning activity. The  user interacts with the system by specifying  frames and by giving descriptions defining the  problem situation. The system uses its  reasoning capacity to build up a model of the  problem situation from which a solution can  interactively be extracted. Examples are  discussed from a variety of domains,  including electronic circuits, mechanical  devices and music. The main thesis is that a  reasoning system is best viewed as a parallel  system whose control and data are  distributed over a large network of processors  that interact by exchanging messages. Such a  system will be metaphorically described as a  society of communicating experts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-542</field><field name="identifier">AITR-542</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local Rotational Symmetries</field><field name="creator">Fleck, Margaret Morrison</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a new representation  for two-dimensional round regions called  Local Rotational Symmetries. Local  Rotational Symmetries are intended as a  companion to Brady's Smoothed Local  Symmetry Representation for elongated  shapes. An algorithm for computing Local  Rotational Symmetry representations at  multiple scales of resolution has been  implemented and results of this  implementation are presented. These results  suggest that Local Rotational Symmetries  provide a more robustly computable and  perceptually accurate description of round  regions than previous proposed  representations. In the course of developing  this representation, it has been necessary to  modify the way both Smoothed Local  Symmetries and Local Rotational Symmetries  are computed. First, grey-scale image  smoothing proves to be better than boundary  smoothing for creating representations at  multiple scales of resolution, because it is  more robust and it allows qualitative changes  in representations between scales. Secondly,  it is proposed that shape representations at  different scales of resolution be explicitly  related, so that information can be passed  between scales and computation at each  scale can be kept local. Such a model for  multi-scale computation is desirable both to  allow efficient computation and to accurately  model human perceptions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-852</field><field name="identifier">AITR-852</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Image Irradiance Equation: Its Solution and Application</field><field name="creator">Bruss, Anna R.</field><field name="description">How much information about the shape of an  object can be inferred from its image? In  particular, can the shape of an object be  reconstructed by measuring the light it reflects  from points on its surface? These questions  were raised by Horn [HO70] who formulated a  set of conditions such that the image  formation can be described in terms of a first  order partial differential equation, the image  irradiance equation. In general, an image  irradiance equation has infinitely many  solutions. Thus constraints necessary to find  a unique solution need to be identified. First  we study the continuous image irradiance  equation. It is demonstrated when and how  the knowledge of the position of edges on a  surface can be used to reconstruct the  surface. Furthermore we show how much  about the shape of a surface can be deduced  from so called singular points. At these points  the surface orientation is uniquely determined  by the measured brightness. Then we  investigate images in which certain types of  silhouettes, which we call b-silhouettes, can  be detected. In particular we answer the  following question in the affirmative: Is there a  set of constraints which assure that if an  image irradiance equation has a solution, it is  unique? To this end we postulate three  constraints upon the image irradiance  equation and prove that they are sufficient to  uniquely reconstruct the surface from its  image. Furthermore it is shown that any two of  these constraints are insufficient to assure a  unique solution to an image irradiance  equation. Examples are given which illustrate  the different issues. Finally, an overview of  known numerical methods for computing  solutions to an image irradiance equation are  presented.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-623</field><field name="identifier">AITR-623</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theory of Handwriting</field><field name="creator">Hollerbach, John</field><field name="description">Handwriting production is viewed as a  constrained modulation of an underlying  oscillatory process. Coupled oscillations in  horizontal and vertical directions produce  letter forms, and when superimposed on a  rightward constant velocity horizontal sweep  result in spatially separated letters.  Modulation of the vertical oscillation is  responsible for control of letter height, either  through altering the frequency or altering the  acceleration amplitude. Modulation of the  horizontal oscillation is responsible for control  of corner shape through altering phase or  amplitude. The vertical velocity zero crossing  in the velocity space diagram is important  from the standpoint of control. Changing the  horizontal velocity value at this zero crossing  controls corner shape, and such changes can  be effected through modifying the horizontal  oscillation amplitude and phase. Changing  the slope at this zero crossing controls writing  slant; this slope depends on the horizontal  and vertical velocity zero amplitudes and on  the relative phase difference. Letter height  modulation is also best applied at the vertical  velocity zero crossing to preserve an even  baseline. The corner shape and slant  constraints completely determine the  amplitude and phase relations between the  two oscillations. Under these constraints  interletter separation is not an independent  parameter. This theory applies generally to a  number of acceleration oscillation patterns  such as sinusoidal, rectangular and  trapezoidal oscillations. The oscillation theory  also provides an explanation for how  handwriting might degenerate with speed. An  implementation of the theory in the context of  the spring muscle model is developed. Here  sinusoidal oscillations arise from a purely  mechanical sources; orthogonal antagonistic  spring pairs generate particular cycloids  depending on the initial conditions.  Modulating between cycloids can be achieved  by changing the spring zero settings at the  appropriate times. Frequency can be  modulated either by shifting between  coactivation and alternating activation of the  antagonistic springs or by presuming variable  spring constant springs. An acceleration and  position measuring apparatus was developed  for measurements of human handwriting.  Measurements of human writing are  consistent with the oscillation theory. It is  shown that the minimum energy movement  for the spring muscle is bang-coast-bang. For  certain parameter values a singular arc  solution can be shown to be minimizing.  Experimental measurements however  indicate that handwriting is not a minimum  energy movement.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-534</field><field name="identifier">AITR-534</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a Computational Theory of Definite Anaphora Comprehension in English Discourse</field><field name="creator">Sidner, Candace Lee</field><field name="description">This report investigates the process of focussing as a description and explanation of the comprehension of certain anaphoric expressions in English discourse. The investigation centers on the interpretation of definite anaphora, that is, on the personal pronouns, and noun phrases used with a definite article the, this or that. Focussing is formalized as a process in which a speaker centers attention on a particular aspect of the discourse. An algorithmic description specifies what the speaker can focus on and how the speaker may change the focus of the discourse as the discourse unfolds. The algorithm allows for a simple focussing mechanism to be constructed: and element in focus, an ordered collection of alternate foci, and a stack of old foci. The data structure for the element in focus is a representation which encodes a limted set of associations between it and other elements from teh discourse as well as from general knowledge.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-537</field><field name="identifier">AITR-537</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recognition of Topological Invariants by Iterative Arrays</field><field name="creator">Beyer, Wendel Terry</field><field name="description">A study is made of the recognition and  transformation of figures by iterative arrays of  finite state automata. A figure is a finite  rectangular two-dimensional array of  symbols. The iterative arrays considered are  also finite, rectangular, and two-dimensional.  The automata comprising any given array are  called cells and are assumed to be  isomorphic and to operate synchronously with  the state of a cell at time t+1 being a function  of the states of it and its four nearest  neighbors at time t. At time t=0 each cell is  placed in one of a fixed number of initial  states. The pattern of initial states thus  introduced represents the figure to be  processed. The resulting sequence of array  states represents a computation based on  the input figure. If one waits for a specially  designated cell to indicate acceptance or  rejection of the figure, the array is said to be  working on a recognition problem. If one waits  for the array to come to a stable configuration  representing an output figure, the array is said  to be working on a transformation problem.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-229</field><field name="identifier">AITR-229</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computer Recognition of Prismatic Solids</field><field name="creator">Griffith, Arnold K.</field><field name="description">An investigation is made into the problem of  constructing a model of the appearance to an  optical input device of scenes consisting of  plane-faced geometric solids.

A general  mathematical analysis is made of optimal  methods for identifying the edge lines in  figures, given a raster of intensities covering  the entire field of view. There is given in  addition a suboptimal statistical decision  procedure, based on the model, for the  identification of a line within a narrow band on  the field of view given an array of intensities  from within the band. A computer program  has been written and extensively tested which  implements this procedure and extracts lines  from real scenes. Other programs were  written which judge the completeness of  extracted sets of lines, and propose and test  for additional lines which had escaped initial  detection.

The basic  approach explored is to view reasoning as a  species of action, so that a program might  apply its reasoning powers to the task of  deciding what inferences to make as well as  deciding what other actions to take. A design  for the architecture of reasoning programs is  proposed. This architecture involves self-consciousness, intentional actions, deliberate  adaptations, and a form of decision-making  based on dialectical argumentation. A  program based on this architecture inspects  itself, describes aspects of itself, and uses  this self-reference and these self-descriptions  in making decisions and taking actions. The  program's mental life includes awareness of  its own concepts, beliefs, desires, intentions,  inferences, actions, and skills. All of these are  represented by self-descriptions in a single  sort of language, so that the program has  access to all of these aspects of itself, and  can reason about them in the same terms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-581</field><field name="identifier">AITR-581</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Structural Descriptions from Examples</field><field name="creator">Winston, Patrick H.</field><field name="description">The research here described centers on how  a machine can recognize concepts and learn  concepts to be recognized.

This method is  complementary to the use of stereoscopy  which relies on matching up sharp detail and  will fail on smooth objects. Until now the  image processing of single views has been  restricted to objects which can meaningfully  be considered two-dimensional or bounded  by plane surfaces. It is possible to derive a  first-order non-linear partial differential  equation in two unknowns relating the  intensity at the image points to the shape of  the objects. This equation can be solved by  means of an equivalent set of five ordinary  differential equations. A curve traced out by  solving this set of equations for one set of  starting values is called a characteristic strip.  Starting one of these strips from each point on  some initial curve will produce the whole  solution surface. The initial curves can  usually be constructed around so-called  singular points. A number of applications of  this metod will be discussed including one to  lunar topography and one to the scanning  electron microscope. In both of these cases  great simplifications occur in the equations. A  note on polyhedra follows and a quantitative  theory of facial make-up is touched upon.

A scene, as seen for instance from a  TV camera or a picture, can be transformed  into a symbolic description of points and lines  or surfaces. This thesis describes several  programs, written in the language CONVERT,  for the analysis of such descriptions in order  to recognize, differentiate and identify desired  objects or classes of objects in the scene.  Examples are given in each case. Although  the recognition might be in terms of  projections of 2-dim and 3-dim objects, we do  not deal with stereoscopic information. One of  our programs (Polybrick) identifies  parallelepipeds in a scene which may contain  partially hidden bodies and non-parallelepipedic objects. The program TD  works mainly with 2-dimensional figures,  although under certain conditions  successfully identifies 3-dim objects.  Overlapping objects are identified when they  are transparent. A third program, DT, works  with 3-dim and 2-dim objects, and does not  identify objects which are not completely  seen. Important restrictions and suppositions  are: (a) the input is assumed perfect  (noiseless), and in a symbolic format; (b) no  perspective deformation is considered. A  portion of this thesis is devoted to the study of  models (symbolic representations) of the  objects we want to identify; different schemes,  some of them already in use, are discussed.  Focusing our attention on the more general  problem of identification of general objects  when they substantially overlap, we propose  some schemes for their recognition, and also  analyze some problems that are met.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-224</field><field name="identifier">AITR-224</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A System for Representing and Using Real-World Knowledge</field><field name="creator">Fahlman, Scott E.</field><field name="description">This report describes a knowledge-base  system in which the information is stored in a  network of small parallel processing  elements ??de and link units ??ich are  controlled by an external serial computer.

Such a network can perform  certain critical deductions and searches very  quickly; it avoids many of the problems of  current systems, which must use complex  heuristics to limit and guided their searches. It  is argued (with examples) that the key  operation in a knowledge-base system is the  intersection of large explicit and semi-explicit  sets.

It is shown  that image intensity is related to surface  orientation and that a variation in image  intensity is related to surface curvature.  Computational methods are developed which  use the measured intensity variation across  surfaces of smooth objects to determine  surface orientation. In general, surface  orientation is not determined locally by the  intensity value recorded at each image point.  Tools are needed to explore the problem of  determining surface orientation from image  intensity. The notion of gradient space ,  popularized by Huffman and Mackworth, is  used to represent surface orientation. The  notion of a reflectance map, originated by  Horn, is used to represent the relation  between surface orientation image intensity.  The image Hessian is defined and used to  represent surface curvature. Properties of  surface curvature are expressed as  constraints on possible surface orientations  corresponding to a given image point.  Methods are presented which embed  assumptions about surface curvature in  algorithms for determining surface orientation  from the intensities recorded in a single view.  If additional images of the same object are  obtained by varying the direction of incident  illumination, then surface orientation is  determined locally by the intensity values  recorded at each image point. This fact is  exploited in a new technique called  photometric stereo. The visual inspection of  surface defects in metal castings is  considered. Two casting applications are  discussed. The first is the precision  investment casting of turbine blades and  vanes for aircraft jet engines. In this  application, grain size is an important process  variable. The existing industry standard for  estimating the average grain size of metals is  implemented and demonstrated on a sample  turbine vane. Grain size can be computed  form the measurements obtained in an  image, once the foreshortening effects of  surface curvature are accounted for. The  second is the green sand mold casting of  shuttle eyes for textile looms. Here, physical  constraints inherent to the casting process  translate into these constraints, it is  necessary to interpret features of intensity as  features of object shape. Both applications  demonstrate that successful visual inspection  requires the ability to interpret observed  changes in intensity in the context of surface  topography. The theoretical tools developed in  this report provide a framework for this  interpretation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-457</field><field name="identifier">AITR-457</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dependency Directed Reasoning for Complex Program Understanding</field><field name="creator">Shrobe, Howard Elliot</field><field name="description">Artificial Intelligence research involves the  creation of extremely complex programs  which must possess the capability to  introspect, learn, and improve their expertise.  Any truly intelligent program must be able to  create procedures and to modify them as it  gathers information from its experience.  [Sussman, 1975] produced such a system for  a  'mini-world'; but truly intelligent programs  must be considerably more complex. A crucial  stepping stone in AI research is the  development of a system which can  understand complex programs well enough to  modify them. There is also a complexity  barrier in the world of commercial software  which is making the cost of software  production and maintenance prohibitive. Here  too a system which is capable of  understanding complex programs is a  necessary step. The Programmer's  Apprentice Project [Rich and Shrobe, 76] is  attempting to develop an interactive  programming tool which will help expert  programmers deal with the complexity  involved in engineering a large software  system. This report describes REASON, the  deductive component of the programmer's  apprentice. REASON is intended to help  expert programmers in the process of  evolutionary program design. REASON  utilizes the engineering techniques of  modelling, decomposition, and analysis by  inspection to determine how modules interact  to achieve the desired overall behavior of a  program. REASON coordinates its various  sources of knowledge by using a  dependency-directed structure which records  the justification for each deduction it makes.  Once a program has been analyzed these  justifications can be summarized into a  teleological structure called a plan which  helps the system understand the impact of a  proposed program modification.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-503</field><field name="identifier">AITR-503</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Processing and Transmission in Cellular Automata</field><field name="creator">Banks, Edwin Roger</field><field name="description">A cellular automaton is an iterative array of  very simple identical information processing  machines called cells. Each cell can  communicate with neighboring cells. At  discrete moments of time the cells can  change from one state to another as a  function of the states of the cell and its  neighbors. Thus on a global basis, the  collection of cells is characterized by some  type of behavior. The goal of this investigation  was to determine just how simple the  individual cells could be while the global  behavior achieved some specified criterion of  complexity ??ually the ability to perform a  computation or to reproduce some pattern.  The chief result described in this thesis is that  an array of identical square cells (in two  dimensions), each cell of which  communicates directly with only its four  nearest edge neighbors and each of which  can exist in only two states, can perform any  computation. This computation proceeds in a  straight forward way. A configuration is a  specification of the states of all the cells in  some area of the iterative array. Another result  described in this thesis is the existence of a  self-reproducing configuration in an array of  four-state cells, a reduction of four states from  the previously known eight-state case. The  technique of information processing in  cellular arrays involves the synthesis of some  basic components. Then the desired  behaviors are obtained by the interconnection  of these components. A chapter on  components describes some sets of basic  components. Possible applications of the  results of this investigation, descriptions of  some interesting phenomena (for vanishingly  small cells), and suggestions for further study  are given later.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-233</field><field name="identifier">AITR-233</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward A Model Of Children's Story Comprehension</field><field name="creator">Charniak, Eugene</field><field name="description">How does a person answer questions about  children's stories?

How is a program debugged? This paper analyzes these questions in the context of understanding simple turtle programs. To understand and debug a program, a description of its intent is required. For turtle programs, this is a model of the desired geometric picture. a picture language is provided for this purpose. Annotation is necessary for documenting the performance of a program in such a way that the system can examine the procedures behavior as well as consider hypothetical lines of development due to tentative debugging edits. A descriptive framework representing both causality and teleology is developed. To understand the relation between program and model, the plan must be known. The plan is a description of the methodology for accomplishing the model. Concepts are explicated for translating the global intent of a declarative model into the local imperative code of a program. Given the plan, model and program, the system can interpret the picture and recognize inconsistencies. The description of the discrepancies between the picture actually produced by the program and the intended scene is the input to a debugging system. Repair of the program is based on a combination of general debugging techniques and specific fixing knowledge associated with the geometric model primitives. In both the plan and repairing the bugs, the system exhibits an interesting style of analysis. It is capable of debugging itself and reformulating its analysis of a plan or bug in response to self-criticism. In this fashion, it can qualitatively reformulate its theory of the program or error to account for surprises or anomalies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-294</field><field name="identifier">AITR-294</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Computational Model of Skill Acquisition</field><field name="creator">Sussman, Gerald J.</field><field name="description">This thesis confronts the nature of the  process of learning an intellectual skill, the  ability to solve problems efficiently in a  particular domain of discourse.

The immediate objective is a computer  system that will recognize objects in a visual  scene, specifically hammers. The computer  receives an array of light intensities from a  device like a television camera. It is to locate  and identify the hammer if one is present. The  computer must produce from the numerical  "sensory data" a symbolic description that  constitutes its perception of the scene. Of  primary concern is the control of the  recognition process. Control decisions  should be guided by the partial results  obtained on the scene. If a hammer handle is  observed this should suggest that the handle  is part of a hammer and advise where to look  for the hammer head. The particular  knowledge that a handle has been found  combines with general knowledge about  hammers to influence the recognition  process. This use of knowledge to direct  control is denoted here by the term "active  knowledge". A descriptive formalism is  presented for visual knowledge which  identifies the relationships relevant to the  active use of the knowledge. A control  structure is provided which can apply  knowledge organized in this fashion actively to  the processing of a given scene.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-345</field><field name="identifier">AITR-345</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hierarchical Shape Description of Objects by Selection and Modification of Prototypes</field><field name="creator">Hollerbach, John M.</field><field name="description">An approach towards shape description, based on prototype modification and generalized cylinders, has been developed and applied to the object domains pottery and polyhedra: (1) A program describes and identifies pottery from vase outlines entered as lists of points.

This thesis explores methods of increasing the ability of procedural deduction systems to deal with incomplete knowledge. The thesis examines in detail, problems involving negation, implication, disjunction, quantification, and equality. Control structure issues and the problem of modelling change under incomplete knowledge are also considered.

The program is  believed to be the first of its kind. From a  small number of parsing rules the program  derives complex configurations, each of which  is associated with a set of reference points in  a numerical representation of a time-continuum. The logical structure of the  program is such that all and only the defined  classes of events are represented in the  output. Because the basis of the program is  syntactic (in the sense that parsing operations  are performed on formal structures in the  input string), many extensions and  refinements can be made without excessive  difficulty. The program can be applied to any  music which can be represented in the input  language. At present, however, it constitutes  the first stage in the development of a set of  analytic tools for the study of so-called atonal  music, the revolutionary and little understood  music which has exerted a decisive influence  upon contemporary practice of the art. The  program and the approach to automatic data-structuring may be of interest to linguists and  scholars in other fields concerned with basic  studies of complex structures produced by  human beings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-225</field><field name="identifier">AITR-225</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbolic Integration</field><field name="creator">Moses, Joel</field><field name="description">SIN and SOLDIER are heuristic programs in  LISP which solve symbolic integration  problems.

The  linguistic analysis in STUDENT is a first  approximation to the analytic portion of a  semantic theory of discourse outlined in the  thesis. STUDENT finds the set of kernel  sentences which are the base of the input  discourse, and transforms this sequence of  kernel sentences into a set of simultaneous  equations which form the semantic base of  the STUDENT system. STUDENT then tries to  solve this set of equations for the values of  requested unknowns. If it is successful it  gives the answers in English.

This system  demonstrates what can reasonably be called  an ability to "understand" semantic  information. SIR's semantic and deductive  ability is based on the construction of an  internal model, which uses word associations  and property lists, for the relational  information normally conveyed in  conversational statements. A format-matching  procedure extracts semantic content from  English sentences. If an input sentence is  declarative, the system adds appropriate  information to the model. If an input sentence  is a question, the system searches the model  until it either finds the answer or determines  why it cannot find the answer. In all cases SIR  reports its conclusions. The system has  some capacity to recognize exceptions to  general rules, resolve certain semantic  ambiguities, and modify its model structure in  order to save computer memory space.  Judging from its conversational ability, SIR, is  a first step toward intelligent man-machine  communication. The author proposes a next  step by describing how to construct a more  general system which is less complex and yet  more powerful than SIR. This proposed  system contains a generalized version of the  SIR model, a formal logical system called  SIR1, and a computer program for testing the  truth of SIR1 statements with respect to the  generalized model by using partial proof  procedures in the predicate calculus. The  thesis also describes the formal properties of  SIR1 and how they relate to the logical  structure of SIR.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-220</field><field name="identifier">AITR-220</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PILOT: A Step Toward Man-Computer Symbiosis</field><field name="creator">Teitelman, Warren</field><field name="description">PILOT is a programming system constructed  in LISP. It is designed to facilitate the  development of programs by easing the  familiar sequence: write some code, run the  program, make some changes, write some  more code, run the program again, etc. As a  program becomes more complex, making  these changes becomes harder and harder  because the implications of changes are  harder to anticipate. In the PILOT system, the  computer plays an active role in this  evolutionary process by providing the means  whereby changes can be effected  immediately, and in ways that seem natural to  the user. The user of PILOT feels that he is  giving advice, or making suggestions, to the  computer about the operation of his  programs, and that the system then performs  the work necessary. The PILOT system is  thus an interface between the user and his  program, monitoring both in the requests of  the user and operation of his program. The  user may easily modify the PILOT system  itself by giving it advice about its own  operation. This allows him to develop his own  language and to shift gradually onto PILOT the  burden of performing routine but increasingly  complicated tasks. In this way, he can  concentrate on the conceptual difficulties in  the original problem, rather than on the  niggling tasks of editing, rewriting, or adding  to his programs. Two detailed examples are  presented. PILOT is a first step toward  computer systems that will help man to  formulate problems in the same way they now  help him to solve them. Experience with it  supports the claim that such "symbiotic  systems" allow the programmer to attack and  solve more difficult problems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-221</field><field name="identifier">AITR-221</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ADEPT: A Heuristic Program for Proving Theorems of Group Theory</field><field name="creator">Norton, Lewis Mark</field><field name="description">A computer program, named ADEPT (A  Distinctly Empirical Prover of Theorems), has  been written which proves theorems taken  from the abstract theory of groups.

In this  thesis, I introduce sparsely faceted arrays (SFAs), a new low-level mechanism for naming regions of memory, or facets, on different  processors in a distributed, shared memory parallel  processing system. Sparsely faceted arrays address the disconnect  between the global distributed arrays provided by conventional architectures  (e.g. the Cray T3 series), and the requirements of high-level  parallel programming methods that wish to use objects that are  distributed over only a subset of processing elements. A sparsely  faceted array names a virtual globally-distributed array, but actual  facets are lazily allocated. By providing simple semantics and  making efficient use of memory, SFAs enable efficient  implementation of a variety of non-uniformly distributed data structures and  related algorithms. I present example applications which use  SFAs, and describe and evaluate simple hardware mechanisms for  implementing SFAs.  Keeping track of which nodes have allocated  facets for a particular SFA is an important task that suggests the  need for automatic memory management, including garbage collection.  To address this need, I first argue that conventional tracing  techniques such as mark/sweep and copying GC are inherently unscalable in  parallel systems. I then present a parallel memory-management  strategy, based on reference-counting, that is capable of garbage  collecting sparsely faceted arrays. I also discuss opportunities  for hardware support of this garbage collection strategy.  I have implemented a high-level hardware/OS  simulator featuring hardware support for sparsely faceted arrays  and automatic garbage collection. I describe the simulator and  outline a few of the numerous details associated with a "real"  implementation of SFAs and SFA-aware garbage collection. Simulation  results are used throughout this thesis in the evaluation of hardware  support mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2002-005</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">sparsely faceted arrays</field><field name="subject">shared memory</field><field name="subject">garbage collection</field><field name="subject">data structures</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2002-005</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generating Semantic Descriptions From Drawings of Scenes With Shadows</field><field name="creator">Waltz, David L.</field><field name="description">The research reported here concerns the  principles used to automatically generate  three-dimensional representations from line  drawings of scenes.

A  program NEWTON is described which  understands and solves problems in  mechanics mini-world of objects moving on  surfaces. Facts and equations such as those  given in mechanics text need to be  represented. However, this is far from  sufficient to solve problems. Human problem  solvers rely on "common sense" and  "qualitative" knowledge which the physics text  tacitly assumes to be present. A mechanics  problem solver must embody such  knowledge. Quantitative knowledge given  by equations and more qualitative common  sense knowledge are the major research  points exposited in this thesis. The major  issue in solving problems is planning.  Planning involves tentatively outlining a  possible path to the solution without actually  solving the problem. Such a plan needs to be  constructed and debugged in the process of  solving the problem. Envisionment, or  qualitative simulation of the event, plays a  central role in this planning process.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-352</field><field name="identifier">AITR-352</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RABBIT: A Compiler for SCHEME</field><field name="creator">Steele, Guy Lewis, Jr.</field><field name="description">We have developed a compiler for the  lexically-scoped dialect of LISP known as  SCHEME. The compiler knows relatively little  about specific data manipulation primitives  such as arithmetic operators, but  concentrates on general issues of  environment and control. Rather than having  specialized knowledge about a large variety of  control and environment constructs, the  compiler handles only a small basis set  which reflects the semantics of lambda-calculus. All of the traditional imperative  constructs, such as sequencing, assignment,  looping, GOTO, as well as many standard  LISP constructs such as AND, OR, and  COND, are expressed in macros in terms of  the applicative basis set. A small number of  optimization techniques, coupled with the  treatment of function calls as GOTO  statements, serve to produce code as good  as that produced by more traditional  compilers. The macro approach enables  speedy implementation of new constructs as  desired without sacrificing efficiency in the  generated code. A fair amount of analysis is  devoted to determining whether environments  may be stack-allocated or must be heap-allocated. Heap-allocated environments are  necessary in general because SCHEME  (unlike Algol 60 and Algol 68, for example)  allows procedures with free lexically scoped  variables to be returned as the values of other  procedures; the Algol stack-allocation  environment strategy does not suffice. The  methods used here indicate that a heap-allocating generalization of the "display"  technique leads to an efficient implementation  of such "upward funargs". Moreover, compile-time optimization and analysis can eliminate  many "funargs" entirely, and so far fewer  environment structures need be allocated at  run time than might be expected. A subset of  SCHEME (rather than triples, for example)  serves as the representation intermediate  between the optimized SCHEME code and the  final output code; code is expressed in this  subset in the so-called continuation-passing  style. As a subset of SCHEME, it enjoys the  same theoretical properties; one could even  apply the same optimizer used on the input  code to the intermediate code. However, the  subset is so chosen that all temporary  quantities are made manifest as variables,  and no control stack is needed to evaluate it.  As a result, this apparently applicative  representation admits an imperative  interpretation which permits easy transcription  to final imperative machine code. These  qualities suggest that an applicative language  like SCHEME is a better candidate for an  UNCOL than the more imperative candidates  proposed to date.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-474</field><field name="identifier">AITR-474</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the Scope of English Quantifiers</field><field name="creator">Vanlehn, Kurt A.</field><field name="description">How can one represent the meaning of English sentences in a formal logical notation  such that the translation of English into this  logical form is simple and general? This  report answers this question for a particular  kind of meaning, namely quantifier scope, and  for a particular part of the translation, namely the syntactic influence on the  translation. Rules are presented which  predict, for example, that the sentence:  Everyone in this room speaks at least two  languages. has the quantifier scope AE in  standard predicate calculus, while the  sentence: At lease two languages are spoken  by everyone in this room. has the quantifier  scope EA. Three different logical forms are  presented, and their translation rules are  examined. One of the logical forms is  predicate calculus. The translation rules for it  were developed by Robert May (May 19 77). The other two logical forms are Skolem  form and a simple computer programming  language. The translation rules for these two  logical forms are new. All three sets of  translation rules are shown to be general, in  the sense that the same rules express the  constraints that syntax imposes on certain  other linguistic phenomena. For example, the  rules that constrain the translation into  Skolem form are shown to constrain definite  np anaphora as well. A large body of carefully  collected data is presented, and used to  assess the empirical accuracy of each of the  theories. None of the three theories is vastly  superior to the others. However, the report  concludes by suggesting that a combination  of the two newer theories would have the  greatest generality and the highest empirical  accuracy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-483</field><field name="identifier">AITR-483</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Parallel Processing Model of Musical Structures</field><field name="creator">Smoliar, Stephen W.</field><field name="description">Euterpe is a real-time computer system for  the modeling of musical structures.

The  formalism is built out of a number of problem-solving primitives together with a hierarchical  multiprocess backtrack control structure.  Statements can be asserted and perhaps  later withdrawn as the state of the world  changes. Under BACKTRACK control  structure, the hierarchy of activations of  functions previously executed is maintained  so that it is possible to revert to any previous  state. Thus programs can easily manipulate  elaborate hypothetical tentative states. In  addition PLANNER uses multiprocessing so  that there can be multiple loci of changes in  state. Goals can be established and  dismissed when they are satisfied. The  deductive system of PLANNER is subordinate  to the hierarchical control structure in order to  maintain the desired degree of control. The  use of a general-purpose matching language  as the basis of the deductive system  increases the flexibility of the system. Instead  of explicitly naming procedures in calls,  procedures can be invoked implicitly by  patterns of what the procedure is supposed to  accomplish. The language is being applied to  solve problems faced by a robot, to write  special purpose routines from goal oriented  language, to express and prove properties of  procedures, to abstract procedures from  protocols of their actions, and as a semantic  base for English.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-258</field><field name="identifier">AITR-258</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progress in Vision and Robotics</field><field name="creator">Winston, Patrick H.</field><field name="description">The Vision Flashes are informal working  papers intended primarily to stimulate internal  interaction among participants in the A.I.

A powerful heuristic  control structure enables BUILD to use a  number of sophisticated construction  techniques in its plans. Among these are the  incorporation of pre-existing structure into the  final design, pre-assembly of movable sub-structures on the table, and use of the extra  blocks as temporary supports and  counterweights in the course of construction.  BUILD does its planning in a modeled 3-space in which blocks of various shapes and  sizes can be represented in any orientation  and location. The modeling system can  maintain several world models at once, and  contains modules for displaying states,  testing them for inter-object contact and  collision, and for checking the stability of  complex structures involving frictional forces.  Various alternative approaches are  discussed, and suggestions are included for  the extension of BUILD-like systems to other  domains. Also discussed are the merits of  BUILD's implementation language,  CONNIVER, for this type of problem solving.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-283</field><field name="identifier">AITR-283</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hypothesis Formation and Evaluation in Medical Diagnosis</field><field name="creator">Rubin, Ann D.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes some aspects of a computer system for doing medical diagnosis in the specialized field of kidney disease. Because such a system faces the spectre of combinatorial explosion, this discussion concentrates on heuristics which control the number of concurrent hypotheses and efficient "compiled" representations of medical knowledge. In particular, the differential diagnosis of hematuria (blood in the urine) is discussed in detail. A protocol of a simulated doctor/patient interaction is presented and analyzed to determine the crucial structures and processes involved in the diagnosis procedure. The data structure proposed for representing medical information revolves around elementary hypotheses which are activated when certain disposing of findings, activating hypotheses, evaluating hypotheses locally and combining hypotheses globally is examined for its heuristic implications. The thesis attempts to fit the problem of medical diagnosis into the framework of other Artifcial Intelligence problems and paradigms and in particular explores the notions of pure search vs. heuristic methods, linearity and interaction, local vs. global knowledge and the structure of hypotheses within the world of kidney disease.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-316</field><field name="identifier">AITR-316</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initial Report on a LISP Programmer's Apprentice</field><field name="creator">Rich, Charles</field><field name="description">This is an initial report on the design and partial implementation of a LISP programmers apprentice, an interactive programming system to be used by an expert programmer in the design, coding, and maintenance of large, complex programs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-354</field><field name="identifier">AITR-354</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qualitative Knowledge, Casual Reasoning and the Localization of Failures</field><field name="creator">Brown, Allen</field><field name="description">This report investigates some techinques appropriate to representing the knowledge necessary for understanding a class of electronic machines -- radio receivers.

The goal of the work was to create a mechanical assembly system that transforms a high-level description of an automatic assembly operation into a program or execution by a computer controlled manipulator. This system allows the initial description of the assembly to be in terms of the desired effects on the parts being assembled. Languages such as WAVE [Bolles &amp; Paul] and MINI [Silver] fail to meet this goal by requiring the assembly operation to be described in terms of manipulator motions. This research concentrates on the spatial complexity of mechanical assembly operations. The assembly problem is seen as the problem of achieving a certain set of geometrical constraints between basic objects while avoiding unwanted collisions. The thesis explores how these two facets, desired constraints and unwanted collisions, affect the primitive operations of the domain.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-397</field><field name="identifier">AITR-397</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexibility and Efficiency in a Computer Program for Designing Circuits</field><field name="creator">Mcdermott, Drew Vincent</field><field name="description">This report is concerned with the problem of achieving flexibility (additivity, modularity) and efficiency (performance, expertise) simultaneously in one AI program.

The functions of the cognitive  map are to assimilate new information about  the environment, to represent the current  position, and to answer route-finding and  relative-position problems. This model (called  the TOUR model) analyzes the cognitive map  in terms of symbolic descriptions of the  environment and operations on those  descriptions. Knowledge about a particular  environment is represented in terms of route  descriptions, a topological network of paths  and places, multiple frames of reference for  relative positions, dividing boundaries, and a  structure of containing regions. The current  position is described by the "You Are Here"  pointer, which acts as a working memory and  a focus of attention. Operations on the  cognitive map are performed by inference  rules which act to transfer information among  different descriptions and the "You Are Here"  pointer. The TOUR model shows how the  particular descriptions chosen to represent  spatial knowledge support assimilation of  new information from local observations into  the cognitive map, and how the cognitive map  solves route-finding and relative-position  problems. A central theme of this research is  that the states of partial knowledge supported  by a representation are responsible for its  ability to function with limited information of  computational resources. The  representations in the TOUR model provide a  rich collection of states of partial knowledge,  and therefore exhibit flexible, "common-sense" behavior.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-418</field><field name="identifier">AITR-418</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Truth Maintenance Systems for Problem Solving</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Jon</field><field name="description">The thesis developed here is that reasoning  programs which take care to record the logical  justifications for program beliefs can apply  several powerful, but simple, domain-independent algorithms to (1) maintain the  consistency of program beliefs, (2) realize  substantial search efficiencies, and (3)  automatically summarize explanations of  program beliefs. These algorithms are the  recorded justifications to maintain the  consistency and well founded basis of the set  of beliefs. The set of beliefs can be efficiently  updated in an incremental manner when  hypotheses are retracted and when new  information is discovered.

One aspect of the theory, causal  analysis, describes how the behavior of  individual components can be combined to  explain the behavior of composite systems.  Another aspect of the theory, teleological  analysis, describes how the notion that the  system has a purpose can be used to aid this  causal analysis. The theory is implemented  as a computer program, which, given a circuit  topology, can construct by qualitative causal  analysis a mechanism graph describing the  functional topology of the system. This  functional topology is then parsed by a  grammar for common circuit functions.  Ambiguities are introduced into the analysis  by the approximate qualitative nature of the  analysis. For example, there are often several  possible mechanisms which might describe  the circuit's function. These are  disambiguated by teleological analysis. The  requirement that each component be  assigned an appropriate purpose in the  functional topology imposes a severe  constraint which eliminates all the  ambiguities. Since both analyses are based  on heuristics, the chosen mechanism is a  rationalization of how the circuit functions, and  does not guarantee that the circuit actually  does function. This type of coarse  understanding of circuits is useful for  analysis, design and troubleshooting.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-529</field><field name="identifier">AITR-529</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Equality in Deduction and Knowledge Representation</field><field name="creator">McAllester, David Allen</field><field name="description">This report describes a system which  maintains canonical expressions for  designators under a set of equalities.

According to this theory,  the image is first processed independently  through a set of different size filters, whose  shape is the Laplacian of a Gaussian, ***.  Zero-crossings in the output of these filters  mark the positions of intensity changes at  different resolutions. Information about these  zero-crossings is then used for deriving a full  symbolic description of changes in intensity in  the image, called the raw primal sketch. The  theory is closely tied with early processing in  the human visual systems. In this report, we  first examine the critical properties of the initial  filters used in the edge detection process,  both from a theoretical and practical  standpoint. The implementation is then used  as a test bed for exploring aspects of the  human visual system; in particular, acuity and  hyperacuity. Finally, we present some  preliminary results concerning the  relationship between zero-crossings detected  at different resolutions, and some  observations relevant to the process by which  the human visual system integrates  descriptions of intensity changes obtained at  different resolutions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-579</field><field name="identifier">AITR-579</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Definition and Implementation of a Computer Programming Language Based on Constraints</field><field name="creator">Steele, Guy Lewis, Jr.</field><field name="description">The constraint paradigm is a model of  computation in which values are deduced  whenever possible, under the limitation that  deductions be local in a certain sense. One  may visualize a constraint 'program' as a  network of devices connected by wires. Data  values may flow along the wires, and  computation is performed by the devices. A  device computes using only locally available  information (with a few exceptions), and  places newly derived values on other, locally  attached wires. In this way computed values  are propagated. An advantage of the  constraint paradigm (not unique to it) is that a  single relationship can be used in more than  one direction. The connections to a device are  not labelled as inputs and outputs; a device  will compute with whatever values are  available, and produce as many new values  as it can. General theorem provers are  capable of such behavior, but tend to suffer  from combinatorial explosion; it is not usually  useful to derive all the possible  consequences of a set of hypotheses. The  constraint paradigm places a certain kind of  limitation on the deduction process. The  limitations imposed by the constraint  paradigm are not the only one possible. It is  argued, however, that they are restrictive  enough to forestall combinatorial explosion in  many interesting computational situations, yet  permissive enough to allow useful  computations in practical situations.  Moreover, the paradigm is intuitive: It is easy  to visualize the computational effects of these  particular limitations, and the paradigm is a  natural way of expressing programs for  certain applications, in particular relationships  arising in computer-aided design. A number  of implementations of constraint-based  programming languages are presented. A  progression of ever more powerful languages  is described, complete implementations are  presented and design difficulties and  alternatives are discussed. The goal  approached, though not quite reached, is a  complete programming system which will  implicitly support the constraint paradigm to  the same extent that LISP, say, supports  automatic storage management.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-595</field><field name="identifier">AITR-595</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6933</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inspection Methods in Programming</field><field name="creator">Rich, Charles</field><field name="description">The work reported here lies in the area of  overlap between artificial intelligence software  engineering. As research in artificial  intelligence, it is a step towards a model of  problem solving in the domain of  programming. In particular, this work focuses  on the routine aspects of programming which  involve the application of previous experience  with similar programs. I call this programming  by inspection. Programming is viewed here  as a kind of engineering activity. Analysis and  synthesis by inspection area prominent part of  expert problem solving in many other  engineering disciplines, such as electrical  and mechanical engineering. The notion of  inspections methods in programming  developed in this work is motivated by similar  notions in other areas of engineering. This  work is also motivated by current practical  concerns in the area of software engineering.  The inadequacy of current programming  technology is universally recognized. Part of  the solution to this problem will be to increase  the level of automation in programming. I  believe that the next major step in the  evolution of more automated programming  will be interactive systems which provide a  mixture of partially automated program  analysis, synthesis and verification. One such  system being developed at MIT, called the  programmer's apprentice, is the immediate  intended application of this work. This report  concentrates on the knowledge are of the  programmer's apprentice, which is the form of  a taxonomy of commonly used algorithms and  data structures. To the extent that a  programmer is able to construct and  manipulate programs in terms of the forms in  such a taxonomy, he may relieve himself of  many details and generally raise the  conceptual level of his interaction with the  system, as compared with present day  programming environments. Also, since it is  practical to expand a great deal of effort pre-analyzing the entries in a library, the difficulty  of verifying the correctness of programs  constructed this way is correspondingly  reduced. The feasibility of this approach is  demonstrated by the design of an initial library  of common techniques for manipulating  symbolic data. This document also reports on  the further development of a formalism called  the plan calculus for specifying computations  in a programming language independent  manner. This formalism combines both data  and control abstraction in a uniform  framework that has facilities for representing  multiple points of view and side effects.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-604</field><field name="identifier">AITR-604</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foundations of Actor Semantics</field><field name="creator">Clinger, William Douglas</field><field name="description">The actor message-passing model of  concurrent computation has inspired new  ideas in the areas of knowledge-based  systems, programming languages and their  semantics, and computer systems  architecture. The model itself grew out of  computer languages such as Planner,  Smalltalk, and Simula, and out of the use of  continuations to interpret imperative  constructs within A-calculus. The  mathematical content of the model has been  developed by Carl Hewitt, Irene Greif, Henry  Baker, and Giuseppe Attardi. This thesis  extends and unifies their work through the  following observations. The ordering laws  postulated by Hewitt and Baker can be proved  using a notion of global time. The most  general ordering laws are in fact equivalent to  an axiom of realizability in global time.  Independence results suggest that some  notion of global time is essential to any model  of concurrent computation. Since  nondeterministic concurrency is more  fundamental than deterministic sequential  computation, there may be no need to take  fixed points in the underlying domain of a  power domain. Power domains built from  incomplete domains can solve the problem of  providing a fixed point semantics for a class of  nondeterministic programming languages in  which a fair merge can be written. The event  diagrams of Greif's behavioral semantics,  augmented by Baker's pending events, form  an incomplete domain. Its power domain is  the semantic domain in which programs  written in actor-based languages are  assigned meanings. This denotational  semantics is compatible with behavioral  semantics. The locality laws postulated by  Hewitt and Baker may be proved for the  semantics of an actor-based language.  Altering the semantics slightly can falsify the  locality laws. The locality laws thus constrain  what counts as an actor semantics.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-633</field><field name="identifier">AITR-633</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Accountable Source-To-Source Transformation System</field><field name="creator">Steele, Barbara Sue Kerne</field><field name="description">Though one is led to believe that program  transformation systems which perform  source-to-source transformations enable the  user to understand and appreciate the  resulting source program, this is not always  the case.

Theoretical and  psychophysical results lead to the following  conclusions for the representation of image  texture: (1) A texture edge primitive is needed  to identify texture change contours, which are  formed by an abrupt change in the 2-D  organization of similar items in an image. The  texture edge can be used for locating  discontinuities in surface structure and  surface geometry and for establishing motion  correspondence. (2) Abrupt changes in  attributes that vary with changing surface  geometry ??ientation, density, length, and  width ??ould be used to identify  discontinuities in surface geometry and  surface structure. (3) Texture tokens are  needed to separate the effects of different  physical processes operating on a surface.  They represent the local structure of the  image texture. Their spatial variation can be  used in the detection of texture discontinuities  and texture gradients, and their temporal  variation may be used for establishing motion  correspondence. What precisely constitutes  the texture tokens is unknown; it appears,  however, that the intensity changes alone will  not suffice, but local groupings of them may.

This work  attacks that problem by speeding up a useful  system component that remembers facts and  tracks down simple consequences. The  redesigned component can assimilate new  facts more quickly because it uses a compact,  grammar-based internal representation to  deal with whole classes of equivalent  expressions at once. It can support faster  hypothetical reasoning because it remembers  the consequences of several assumption  sets at once. The new design is targeted for  situations in which many of the stored facts  are equalities. The deductive machinery  considered here supplements stored  premises with simple new conclusions. The  stored premises include permanently  asserted facts and temporarily adopted  assumptions. The new conclusions are  derived by substituting equals for equals and  using the properties of the logical connectives  AND, Or, and NOT. The deductive system  provides supporting premises for its derived  conclusions. Reasoning that involves  quantifiers is beyond the scope of its limited  and automatic operation.

Edge detection  operators are typically designed to optimally  estimate first or second derivative over some  (usually small) support. Other criteria such as  output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have  also been argued for. This thesis is an  attempt to formulate a set of edge detection  criteria that capture as directly as possible the  desirable properties of an edge operator.  Variational techniques are used to find a  solution over the space of all linear shift  invariant operators. The first criterion is that  the detector have low probability of error i.e.  failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points  should be as close as possible to the centre  of the true edge. The third criterion is that  there should be low probability of more than  one response to a single edge. The technique  is used to find optimal operators for step  edges and for extended impulse profiles  (ridges or valleys in two dimensions). The  extension of the one dimensional operators to  two dimentions is then discussed. The result  is a set of operators of varying width, length  and orientation. The problem of combining  these outputs into a single description is  discussed, and a set of heuristics for the  integration are given.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-720</field><field name="identifier">AITR-720</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Issues in the Design and Implementation of Act 2</field><field name="creator">Theriault, Daniel G.</field><field name="description">Act2 is a highly concurrent programming  language designed to exploit the processing  power available from parallel computer  architectures.

It is required of all  students at MIT who major in Electrical  Engineering or in Computer Science, as one  fourth of the "common core curriculum," which  also includes two subjects on circuits and  linear systems and a subject on the design of  digital systems. We have been involved in the  development of this subject since 1978, and  we have taught this material in its present  form since the fall of 1980 to approximately  600 students each year. Most of these  students have had little or no prior formal  training in computation, although most have  played with computers a bit and a few have  had extensive programming or hardware  design experience. Our design of this  introductory Computer Science subject  reflects two major concerns. First we want to  establish the idea that a computer language  is not just a way of getting a computer to  perform operations, but rather that it is a novel  formal medium for expressing ideas about  methodology. Thus, programs must be written  for people to read, and only incidentally for  machines to execute. Secondly, we believe  that the essential material to be addressed by  a subject at this level, is not the syntax of  particular programming language constructs,  nor clever algorithms for computing particular  functions of efficiently, not even the  mathematical analysis of algorithms and the  foundations of computing, but rather the  techniques used to control the intellectual  complexity of large software systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-735</field><field name="identifier">AITR-735</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">KBEmacs: A Step Toward the Programmer's Apprentice</field><field name="creator">Waters, Richard C.</field><field name="description">The Knowledge-Based Editor in Emacs  (KBEmacs) is the current demonstration  system implemented as part of the  Programmer's Apprentice project.

It investigates the high  degree of parallelism inherent in the  computations, and presents two  "mathematically exact" formulations especially  suited to high-speed, highly parallel  implementations using special-purpose  hardware or VLSI devices. In principle, the  formulations should permit the calculations to  run at a speed bounded only by I/O. The first  presented is a parallel version of the recent  linear Newton-Euler recursive algorithm. The  time cost is also linear in the number of joints,  but the real-time coefficients are reduced by  almost two orders of magnitude. The second  formulation reports a new parallel algorithm  which shows that it is possible to improve  upon the linear time dependency. The real  time required to perform the calculations  increases only as the [log2] of the number of  joints. Either formulation is susceptible to a  systolic pipelined architecture in which  complete sets of joint torques emerge at  successive intervals of four floating-point  operations. Hardware requirements  necessary to support the algorithm are  considered and found not to be excessive,  and a VLSI implementation architecture is  suggested. We indicate possible applications  to incorporating dynamical considerations into  trajectory planning, e.g. it may be possible to  build an on-line trajectory optimizer.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-754</field><field name="identifier">AITR-754</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motion Planning with Six Degrees of Freedom</field><field name="creator">Donald, Bruce R.</field><field name="description">The motion planning problem is of central  importance to the fields of robotics, spatial  planning, and automated design. In robotics  we are interested in the automatic synthesis  of robot motions, given high-level  specifications of tasks and geometric models  of the robot and obstacles. The Mover's  problem is to find a continuous, collision-free  path for a moving object through an  environment containing obstacles. We  present an implemented algorithm for the  classical formulation of the three-dimensional  Mover's problem: given an arbitrary rigid  polyhedral moving object P with three  translational and three rotational degrees of  freedom, find a continuous, collision-free path  taking P from some initial configuration to a  desired goal configuration.   This thesis describes the first known  implementation of a complete algorithm (at a  given resolution) for the full six degree of  freedom Movers' problem. The algorithm  transforms the six degree of freedom  planning problem into a point navigation  problem in a six-dimensional configuration  space (called C-Space). The C-Space  obstacles, which characterize the physically  unachievable configurations, are directly  represented by six-dimensional manifolds  whose boundaries are five dimensional C-surfaces. By characterizing these surfaces  and their intersections, collision-free paths  may be found by the closure of three  operators which (i) slide along 5-dimensional  intersections of level C-Space obstacles; (ii)  slide along 1- to 4-dimensional intersections  of level C-surfaces; and (iii) jump between 6  dimensional obstacles.  Implementing the point navigation operators  requires solving fundamental  representational and algorithmic questions:  we will derive new structural properties of the  C-Space constraints and shoe how to  construct and represent C-Surfaces and their  intersection manifolds. A definition and new  theoretical results are presented for a six-dimensional C-Space extension of the  generalized Voronoi diagram, called the C-Voronoi diagram, whose structure we relate to  the C-surface intersection manifolds. The  representations and algorithms we develop  impact many geometric planning problems,  and extend to Cartesian manipulators with six  degrees of freedom.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-791</field><field name="identifier">AITR-791</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Switching Between Discrete and Continuous Process Models to Predict Molecular Genetic Activity</field><field name="creator">Weld, Daniel Sabey</field><field name="description">Two kinds of process models have been  used in programs that reason about change:  Discrete and continuous models.

It offers mechanisms, tools, and  ready-made parts for building user interfaces.  A general user interface model underlies the  base, organized around the concept of a  presentation: a visible text or graphic for  conveying information. Te base and model  emphasize domain independence and style  independence, to apply to the widest possible  range of interfaces.  The primitive presentation system model  treats the interface as a system of processes  maintaining a semantic relation between an  application data base and a presentation data  base, the symbolic screen description  containing presentations. A presenter  continually updates the presentation data  base from the application data base. The  user manipulates presentations with a  presentation editor. A recognizer translates  the user's presentation manipulation into  application data base commands. The  primitive presentation system can be  extended to model more complex systems by  attaching additional presentation systems. In  order to illustrate the model's generality and  descriptive capabilities, extended model  structures for several existing user interfaces  are discussed.  The base provides support for building the  application and presentation data bases,  linked together into a single, uniform network,  including descriptions of classes of objects  as we as the objects themselves. The base  provides an initial presentation data base  network graphics to continually display it, and  editing functions. A variety of tools and  mechanisms help create and control  presenters and recognizers. To demonstrate  the base's utility, three interfaces to an  operating system were constructed,  embodying different styles: icons, menu, and  graphical annotation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-794</field><field name="identifier">AITR-794</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6946</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for Conjunctive Goals</field><field name="creator">Chapman, David</field><field name="description">The problem of achieving conjunctive goals  has been central to domain independent  planning research; the nonlinear constraint-posting approach has been most successful.

Most designs are known  combinations of common configurations  tailored for the particular problem at hand. In  this thesis I show that much of the behavior of  a designer engaged in such ordinary design  can be modelled by a clearly defined  computational mechanism executing a set of  stylized rules. Each of my rules embodies a  particular piece of the designer's knowledge.  A circuit is represented as a hierarchy of  abstract objects, each of which is composed  of other objects. The leaves of this tree  represent the physical devices from which  physical circuits are fabricated. By analogy  with context-free languages, a class of circuits  is generated by a phrase-structure grammar  of which each rule describes how one type of  abstract object can be expanded into a  combination of more concrete parts.  Circuits are designed by first postulating an  abstract object which meets the particular  design requirements. This object is then  expanded into a concrete circuit by successive  refinement using rules of my grammar. There  are in general many rules which can be used  to expand a given abstract component.  Analysis must be done at each level of the  expansion to constrain the search to a  reasonable set. Thus the rule of my circuit  grammar provide constraints which allow the  approximate qualitative analysis of partially  instantiated circuits. Later, more careful  analysis in terms of more concrete  components may lead to the rejection of a line  of expansion which at first looked promising. I  provide special failure rules to direct the repair  in this case.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-807</field><field name="identifier">AITR-807</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Motion Planning with Uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Erdmann, Michael Andreas</field><field name="description">Robots must successfully plan and execute  tasks in the presence of uncertainty.  Uncertainty arises from errors in modeling,  sensing, and control. Planning in the  presence of uncertainty constitutes one facet  of the general motion planning problem in  robotics. This problem is concerned with the  automatic synthesis of motion strategies from  high level task specification and geometric  models of environments.  In order to develop successful motion  strategies, it is necessary to understand the  effect of uncertainty on the geometry of object  interactions. Object interactions, both static  and dynamic, may be represented in  geometrical terms. This thesis investigates  geometrical tools for modeling and  overcoming uncertainty.  The thesis describes an algorithm for  computing backprojections o desired task  configurations. Task goals and motion states  are specified in terms of a moving object's  configuration space. Backprojections specify  regions in configuration space from which  particular motions are guaranteed to  accomplish a desired task. The  backprojection algorithm considers surfaces  in configuration space that facilitate sliding  towards the goal, while avoiding surfaces on  which motions may prematurely halt.  In executing a motion for a backprojection  region, a plan executor must be able to  recognize that a desired task has been  accomplished. Since sensors are subject to  uncertainty, recognition of task success is not  always possible. The thesis considers the  structure of backprojection regions and of task  goals that ensures goal recognizability.  The thesis also develops a representation of  friction in configuration space, in terms of a  friction cone analogous to the real space  friction cone. The friction cone provides the  backprojection algorithm with a geometrical  tool for determining points at which motions  may halt.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-810</field><field name="identifier">AITR-810</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6949</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Justified Generalization: Acquiring Procedures from Examples</field><field name="creator">Andreae, Peter Merrett</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an implemented  system called NODDY for acquiring  procedures from examples presented by a  teacher. Acquiring procedures form examples  involves several different generalization tasks.  Generalization is an underconstrained task,  and the main issue of machine learning is  how to deal with this underconstraint. The  thesis presents two principles for  constraining generalization on which NODDY  is based. The first principle is to exploit  domain based constraints. NODDY  demonstrated how such constraints can be  used both to reduce the space of possible  generalizations to manageable size, and how  to generate negative examples out of positive  examples to further constrain the  generalization. The second principle is to  avoid spurious generalizations by requiring  justification before adopting a generalization.  NODDY demonstrates several different ways  of justifying a generalization and proposes a  way of ordering and searching a space of  candidate generalizations based on how  much evidence would be required to justify  each generalization.  Acquiring procedures also involves three  types of constructive generalizations: inferring  loops (a kind of group), inferring complex  relations and state variables, and inferring  predicates. NODDY demonstrates three  constructive generalization methods for these  kinds of generalization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-834</field><field name="identifier">AITR-834</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TEMPEST: A Template Editor for Structured Text</field><field name="creator">Sterpe, Peter J.</field><field name="description">TEMPEST is a full-screen text editor that  incorporates a structural paradigm in addition  to the more traditional textual paradigm  provided by most editors.

Blocks  can be defined to correspond to the structural  features of he text, thereby providing more  meaningful objects to operate on than  characters of lines.  The structural representation of the text is kept  in the background, giving TEMPEST the  appearance of a typical text editor.

Unlike dataflow and functional programming,  however, actors are dynamically  reconfigurable and can model shared  resources with changing local state.  Concurrency is spawned in actors using  asynchronous message-passing, pipelining,  and the dynamic creation of actors. This  thesis deals with some central issues in  distributed computing. Specifically, problems  of divergence and deadlock are addressed.  For example, actors permit dynamic deadlock  detection and removal. The problem of  divergence is contained because  independent transactions can execute  concurrently and potentially infinite processes  are nevertheless available for interaction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-844</field><field name="identifier">AITR-844</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AFL-1: A Programming Language for Massively Concurrent Computers</field><field name="creator">Blelloch, Guy</field><field name="description">Computational models are arising is which  programs are constructed by specifying large  networks of very simple computational  devices.

The focus of the research is to use  these hierarchies to achieve robust  recognition based on effective organization  and indexing schemes for model libraries.  The goal of the system is to recognize  parameterized instances of non-rigid model  objects contained in a large knowledge base  despite the presence of noise and occlusion.  Robustness is achieved by developing a  system that can recognize viewed objects that  are scaled or mirror-image instances of the  known models or that contain components  sub-parts with different relative scaling,  rotation, or translation than in models. The  approach taken in this thesis is to develop an  object shape representation that incorporates  a component sub-part hierarchy- to allow for  efficient and correct indexing into an  automatically generated model library as well  as for relative parameterization among sub-parts, and a scale hierarchy- to allow for a  general to specific recognition procedure.  After analysis of the issues and inherent  tradeoffs in the recognition process, a system  is implemented using a representation based  on significant contour curvature changes and  a recognition engine based on geometric  constraints of feature properties. Examples of  the system's performance are given, followed  by an analysis of the results.

Marr, Julesz, and others  have proposed that texture is represented by  small lines or blobs, called 'textons' by Julesz  [1981a], together with their attributes, such as  orientation, elongation, and intensity.  Psychophysical studies suggest that texture  boundaries are perceived where distributions  of attributes over neighborhoods of textons  differ significantly. However, these studies,  which deal with synthetic images, neglect to  consider two important questions: How can  these textons be extracted from images of  natural scenes? And how, exactly, are texture  boundaries then found? This thesis proposes  answers to these questions by presenting an  algorithm for computing blobs from natural  images and a statistic for measuring the  difference between two sample distributions  of blob attributes. As part of the blob detection  algorithm, methods for estimating image  noise are presented, which are applicable to  edge detection as well.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-968</field><field name="identifier">AITR-968</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Principle-Based Parsing</field><field name="creator">Berwick, Robert C.</field><field name="description">During the past few years, there has been  much discussion of a shift from rule-based  systems to principle-based systems for  natural language processing.

The system, called Silica  Pithecus, accepts the schematic of an MOS  circuit and a specification of the circuit's  intended digital behavior. Silica Pithecus  determines if the circuit meets its  specification. If the circuit fails to meet its  specification Silica Pithecus returns to the  designer the reason for the failure. Unlike  earlier verifiers which modelled primitives  (e.g., transistors) as unidirectional digital  devices, Silica Pithecus models primitives  more realistically. Transistors are modelled  as bidirectional devices of varying  resistances, and nodes are modelled as  capacitors. Silica Pithecus operates  hierarchically, interactively, and incrementally.  Major contributions of this research include a  formal understanding of the relationship  between different behavioral descriptions  (e.g., signal, boolean, and arithmetic  descriptions) of the same device, and a  formalization of the relationship between the  structure, behavior, and context of device.  Given these formal structures my methods  find sufficient conditions on the inputs of  circuits which guarantee the correct operation  of the circuit in the desired descriptive  domain. These methods are algorithmic and  complete. They also handle complex  phenomena such as races and charge  sharing.

The Salisbury robot  hand demonstrated many of these controlled  slipping techniques, illustrating many results  of this analysis.  First, the possible slipping motions were  found as a function of the location, orientation,  and types of contact between the hand and  object.

This thesis presents an  implemented parser, based on Government-Binding (GB) theory, for a particular free-word  order language, Warlpiri, an aboriginal  language of central Australia. The words in a  sentence of a free-word order language may  swap about relatively freely with little effect on  meaning: the permutations of a sentence  mean essentially the same thing. It is  assumed that this similarity in meaning is  directly reflected in the syntax. The parser  presented here properly processes free word  order because it assigns the same syntactic  structure to the permutations of a single  sentence. The parser also handles fixed word  order, as well as other phenomena. On the  view presented here, there is no such thing as  a "configurational" or "non-configurational"  language. Rather, there is a spectrum of  languages that are more or less ordered. The  operation of this parsing system is quite  different in character from that of more  traditional rule-based parsing systems, e.g.,  context-free parsers. In this system, parsing is  carried out via the construction of two different  structures, one encoding precedence  information and one encoding hierarchical  information. This bipartite representation is  the key to handling both free- and fixed-order  phenomena. This thesis first presents an  overview of the portion of Warlpiri that can be  parsed. Following this is a description of the  linguistic theory on which the parser is based.  The chapter after that describes the  representations and algorithms of the parser.

The  model that has been constructed is based on  abstract principles as developed by Chomsky  (1981) and several other researchers working  within the "Government and Binding" (GB)  framework. Thus, the grammar is viewed as a  modular system of principles rather than a  large set of ad hoc language-specific rules.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1000</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1000</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural Object Categorization</field><field name="creator">Bobick, Aaron F.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of categorizing natural objects. To provide a criteria for categorization we propose that the purpose of a categorization is to support the inference of unobserved properties of objects from the observed properties. Because no such set of categories can be constructed in an arbitrary world, we present the Principle of Natural Modes as a claim about the structure of the world.  We first define an evaluation function that measures how well a set of categories supports the inference goals of the observer. Entropy measures for property uncertainty and category uncertainty are combined through a free parameter that reflects the goals of the observer. Natural categorizations are shown to be those that are stable with respect to this free parameter. The evaluation function is tested in the domain of leaves and is found to be sensitive to the structure of the natural categories corresponding to the different species.  We next develop a categorization paradigm that utilizes the categorization evaluation function in recovering natural categories. A statistical hypothesis generation algorithm is presented that is shown to be an effective categorization procedure. Examples drawn from several natural domains are presented, including data known to be a difficult test case for numerical categorization techniques. We next extend the categorization paradigm such that multiple levels of natural categories are recovered; by means of recursively invoking the categorization procedure both the genera and species are recovered in a population of anaerobic bacteria.  Finally, a method is presented for evaluating the utility of features in recovering natural categories. This method also provides a mechanism for determining which features are constrained by the different processes present in a multiple modal world.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1001</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1001</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Dynamics Model of a Cartesian Robot</field><field name="creator">Reynoso, Alfonso Garcia</field><field name="description">Methods are developed for predicting vibration  response characteristics of systems which  change configuration during operation. A  cartesian robot, an example of such a  position-dependent system, served as a test  case for these methods and was studied in  detail.   The chosen system model was formulated  using the technique of Component Mode  Synthesis (CMS). The model assumes that  he system is slowly varying, and connects the  carriages to each other and to the robot  structure at the slowly varying connection  points. The modal data required for each  component is obtained experimentally in  order to get a realistic model. The analysis  results in prediction of vibrations that are  produced by the inertia forces as well as  gravity and friction forces which arise when  the robot carriages move with some  prescribed motion.  Computer simulations and experimental  determinations are conducted in order to  calculate the vibrations at the robot end-effector. Comparisons are shown to validate  the model in two ways: for fixed configuration  the mode shapes and natural frequencies are  examined, and then for changing  configuration the residual vibration at the end  of the mode is evaluated.  A preliminary study was done on a  geometrically nonlinear system which also  has position-dependency. The system  consisted of a flexible four-bar linkage with  elastic input and output shafts. The behavior  of the rocker-beam is analyzed for different  boundary conditions to show how some  limiting cases are obtained. A dimensional  analysis leads to an evaluation of the  consequences of dynamic similarity on the  resulting vibration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1009</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1009</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Control of Robot Manipulators with Kinematic Redundancy</field><field name="creator">Chang, Pyung H.</field><field name="description">A closed-form solution formula for the  kinematic control of manipulators with  redundancy is derived, using the Lagrangian  multiplier method. Differential relationship  equivalent to the Resolved Motion Method has  been also derived. The proposed method is  proved to provide with the exact equilibrium  state for the Resolved Motion Method. This  exactness in the proposed method fixes the  repeatability problem in the Resolved Motion  Method, and establishes a fixed  transformation from workspace to the joint  space. Also the method, owing to the  exactness, is demonstrated to give more  accurate trajectories than the Resolved Motion  Method. In addition, a new performance  measure for redundancy control has been  developed. This measure, if used with  kinematic control methods, helps achieve  dexterous movements including singularity  avoidance. Compared to other measures  such as the manipulability measure and the  condition number, this measure tends to give  superior performances in terms of preserving  the repeatability property and providing with  smoother joint velocity trajectories. Using the  fixed transformation property, Taylor's  Bounded Deviation Paths Algorithm has been  extended to the redundant manipulators.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1022</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1022</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Grouping in Visual Object Recognition.</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, David W.</field><field name="description">The report describes a recognition system  called GROPER, which performs grouping by  using distance and relative orientation  constraints that estimate the likelihood of  different edges in an image coming from the  same object.

Flexibility of a robot can be explained in two  directions. The first is to increase the physical  generality of the robot such that it can be  easily reconfigured to handle a wide variety of  tasks. The second direction is to increase the  ability of the robot to interact with its  environment such that tasks can still be  successfully completed in the presence of  uncertainties. The use of articulated hands  are capable of adapting to a wide variety of  grasp shapes, hence reducing the need for  special tooling. The availability of low mass,  high bandwidth points close to the  manipulated object also offers significant  improvements I the control of fine motions.  This thesis provides a framework for using  articulated hands to perform local  manipulation of objects. N particular, it  addresses the issues in effecting compliant  motions of objects in Cartesian space. The  Stanford/JPL hand is used as an example to  illustrate a number of concepts. The  examples provide a unified methodology for  controlling articulated hands grasping with  point contacts. We also present a high-level  hand programming system based on the  methodologies developed in this thesis.  Compliant motion of grasped objects and  dexterous manipulations can be easily  described in the LISP-based hand  programming language.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1029</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1029</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bondaries and Topological Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Fleck, Margaret Morrison</field><field name="description">This thesis develops a model for the  topological structure of situations.

Existing methods for  model-based troubleshooting have not scaled  up to deal with complex circuits, in part  because traditional circuit models do not  explicitly represent aspects of the device that  troubleshooters would consider important.  For complex devices the model of the target  device should be constructed with the goal of  troubleshooting explicitly in mind. Given that  methodology, the principal contributions of the  thesis are ways of representing complex  circuits to help make troubleshooting feasible.  Temporally coarse behavior descriptions are  a particularly powerful simplification.  Instantiating this idea for the circuit domain  produces a vocabulary for describing digital  signals. The vocabulary has a level of  temporal detail sufficient to make useful  predictions abut the response of the circuit  while it remains coarse enough to make  those predictions computationally tractable.  Other contributions are principles for using  these representations. Although not  embodied in a program, these principles are  sufficiently concrete that models can be  constructed manually from existing circuit  descriptions such as schematics, part  specifications, and state diagrams. One such  principle is that if there are components with  particularly likely failure modes or failure  modes in which their behavior is drastically  simplified, this knowledge should be  incorporated into the model. Further  contributions include the solution of technical  problems resulting from the use of explicit  temporal representations and design  descriptions with tangled hierarchies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1074</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1074</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Task-Level Robot Learning</field><field name="creator">Aboaf, Eric W.</field><field name="description">We are investigating how to program robots  so that they learn from experience.

Optimist compiles  Concurrent Smalltalk to the assembly  language of the Message-Driven Processor  (MDP). The compiler includes numerous  optimization techniques such as dead code  elimination, dataflow analysis, constant  folding, move elimination, concurrency  analysis, duplicate code merging, tail  forwarding, use of register variables, as well  as various MDP-specific optimizations in the  code generator.  The MDP presents some unique challenges  and opportunities for compilation. Due to the  MDP's small memory size, it is critical that the  size of the generated code be as small as  possible. The MDP is an inherently concurrent  processor with efficient mechanisms for  sending and receiving messages; the  compiler takes advantage of these  mechanisms. The MDP's tagged architecture  allows very efficient support of object-oriented  languages such as Concurrent Smalltalk.  The initial goals for the MDP were to have the  MDP execute about twenty instructions per  method and contain 4096 words of memory.  This compiler shows that these goals are too  optimistic -- most methods are longer, both in  terms of code size and running time. Thus,  the memory size of the MDP should be  increased.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1080</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1080</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/6973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Systems Approach to the Torque Control of a Permanent Magnet Brushless Motor</field><field name="creator">Paul, Benjamin J.</field><field name="description">Many approaches to force control have  assumed the ability to command torques  accurately.

That is, the  process of comprehending and producing  utterances is bounded above by the class NP,  and below by NP-hardness. This constructive  complexity thesis has two empirical  consequences. The first is to predict that a  linguistic theory outside NP is unnaturally  powerful. The second is to predict that a  linguistic theory easier than NP-hard is  descriptively inadequate. To prove the lower  bound, I show that the following three  subproblems of language comprehension  are all NP-hard: decide whether a given  sound is possible sound of a given language;  disambiguate a sequence of words; and  compute the antecedents of pronouns. The  proofs are based directly on the empirical  facts of the language user's knowledge,  under an appropriate idealization. Therefore,  they are invariant across linguistic theories.  (For this reason, no knowledge of linguistic  theory is needed to understand the proofs,  only knowledge of English.) To illustrate the  usefulness of the upper bound, I show that  two widely-accepted analyses of the language  user's knowledge (of syntactic ellipsis and  phonological dependencies) lead to  complexity outside of NP (PSPACE-hard and  Undecidable, respectively). Next, guided by  the complexity proofs, I construct alternate  linguisitic analyses that are strictly superior on  descriptive grounds, as well as being less  complex computationally (in NP). The report  also presents a new framework for linguistic  theorizing, that resolves important puzzles in  generative linguistics, and guides the  mathematical investigation of human  language.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1260</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1260</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Region-Based Feature Interpretation for Recognizing 3D Models in 2D Images</field><field name="creator">Clemens, David T.</field><field name="description">In model-based vision, there are a huge  number of possible ways to match model  features to image features.

Such a selection mechanism has  been found to be crucial in reducing the  combinatorial search involved in the matching  stage of object recognition. Even though  selection is of help in recognition, it has  largely remained unsolved because of the  difficulty in isolating regions belonging to  objects under complex imaging conditions  involving occlusions, changing illumination,  and object appearances. This thesis presents  a novel approach to the selection problem by  proposing a computational model of visual  attentional selection as a paradigm for  selection in recognition. In particular, it  proposes two modes of attentional selection,  namely, attracted and pay attention modes as  being appropriate for data and model-driven  selection in recognition. An implementation of  this model has led to new ways of extracting  color, texture and line group information in  images, and their subsequent use in isolating  areas of the scene likely to contain the model  object. Among the specific results in this  thesis are: a method of specifying color by  perceptual color categories for fast color  region segmentation and color-based  localization of objects, and a result showing  that the recognition of texture patterns on  model objects is possible under changes in  orientation and occlusions without detailed  segmentation. The thesis also presents an  evaluation of the proposed model by  integrating with a 3D from 2D object  recognition system and recording the  improvement in performance. These results  indicate that attentional selection can  significantly overcome the computational  bottleneck in object recognition, both due to a  reduction in the number of features, and due  to a reduction in the number of matches  during recognition using the information  derived during selection. Finally, these  studies have revealed a surprising use of  selection, namely, in the partial solution of the  pose of a 3D object.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1420</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1420</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explorations of the Practical Issues of Learning Prediction-Control Tasks Using Temporal Difference Learning Methods</field><field name="creator">Isbell, Charles L.</field><field name="description">There has been recent interest in using  temporal difference learning methods to  attack problems of prediction and control.

In this work we present a number of new CMOS logic families, Charge Recovery Logic (CRL) as well as the much improved Split-Level Charge Recovery Logic (SCRL), within which the transfer of charge between the nodes occurs quasistatically. Operating quasistatically, these logic families have an energy dissipation that drops linearly with operating frequency, i.e., their power consumption drops quadratically with operating frequency as opposed to the linear drop of conventional CMOS. The circuit techniques in these new families rely on constructing an explicitly reversible pipelined logic gate, where the information necessary to recover the energy used to compute a value is provided by computing its logical inverse. Information necessary to uncompute the inverse is available from the subsequent inverse logic stage. We demonstrate the low energy operation of SCRL by presenting the results from the testing of the first fully quasistatic 8 x 8 multiplier chip (SCRL-1) employing SCRL circuit techniques.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1500</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1500</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive Dynamics in the Control of Gymnastic Maneuvers</field><field name="creator">Playter, Robert</field><field name="description">The control of aerial gymnastic maneuvers is challenging because these maneuvers frequently involve complex rotational motion and because the performer has limited control of the maneuver during flight. A performer can influence a maneuver using a sequence of limb movements during flight. However, the same sequence may not produce reliable performances in the presence of off-nominal conditions. How do people compensate for variations in performance to reliably produce aerial maneuvers? In this report I explore the role that passive dynamic stability may play in making the performance of aerial maneuvers simple and reliable.  I present a control strategy comprised of active and passive components for performing robot front somersaults in the laboratory. I show that passive dynamics can neutrally stabilize the layout somersault which involves an "inherently unstable" rotation about the intermediate principal axis. And I show that a strategy that uses open loop joint torques plus passive dynamics leads to more reliable 1 1/2 twisting front somersaults in simulation than a strategy that uses prescribed limb motion.  Results are presented from laboratory experiments on gymnastic robots, from dynamic simulation of humans and robots, and from linear stability analyses of these systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1504</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1504</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameter Estimation in Chaotic Systems</field><field name="creator">Hung, Elmer S.</field><field name="description">This report examines how to estimate the  parameters of a chaotic system given noisy  observations of the state behavior of the  system. Investigating parameter estimation  for chaotic systems is interesting because of  possible applications for high-precision  measurement and for use in other signal  processing, communication, and control  applications involving chaotic systems. In this  report, we examine theoretical issues  regarding parameter estimation in chaotic  systems and develop an efficient algorithm to  perform parameter estimation. We discover  two properties that are helpful for performing  parameter estimation on non-structurally  stable systems. First, it turns out that most  data in a time series of state observations  contribute very little information about the  underlying parameters of a system, while a  few sections of data may be extraordinarily  sensitive to parameter changes. Second, for  one-parameter families of systems, we  demonstrate that there is often a preferred  direction in parameter space governing how  easily trajectories of one system can  "shadow'" trajectories of nearby systems.  This asymmetry of shadowing behavior in  parameter space is proved for certain families  of maps of the interval. Numerical evidence  indicates that similar results may be true for a  wide variety of other systems. Using the two  properties cited above, we devise an  algorithm for performing parameter  estimation. Standard parameter estimation  techniques such as the extended Kalman  filter perform poorly on chaotic systems  because of divergence problems. The  proposed algorithm achieves accuracies  several orders of magnitude better than the  Kalman filter and has good convergence  properties for large data sets.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1541</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1541</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contact Sensing: A Sequential Decision Approach to Sensing Manipulation Contact</field><field name="creator">Eberman, Brian Scott</field><field name="description">This paper describes a new statistical,  model-based approach to building a contact  state observer. The observer uses  measurements of the contact force and  position, and prior information about the task  encoded in a graph, to determine the current  location of the robot in the task configuration  space. Each node represents what the  measurements will look like in a small region  of configuration space by storing a predictive,  statistical, measurement model. This  approach assumes that the measurements  are statistically block independent conditioned  on knowledge of the model, which is a fairly  good model of the actual process. Arcs in the  graph represent possible transitions between  models. Beam Viterbi search is used to  match measurement history against possible  paths through the model graph in order to  estimate the most likely path for the robot. The  resulting approach provides a new decision  process that can be use as an observer for  event driven manipulation programming. The  decision procedure is significantly more  robust than simple threshold decisions  because the measurement history is used to  make decisions. The approach can be used  to enhance the capabilities of autonomous  assembly machines and in quality control  applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1543</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1543</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced Reality Visualization in a Surgical Environment</field><field name="creator">Mellor, J.P.</field><field name="description">Enhanced reality visualization is the process  of enhancing an image by adding to it  information which is not present in the original  image. A wide variety of information can be  added to an image ranging from hidden lines  or surfaces to textual or iconic data about a  particular part of the image. Enhanced reality  visualization is particularly well suited to  neurosurgery. By rendering brain structures  which are not visible, at the correct location in  an image of a patient's head, the surgeon is  essentially provided with X-ray vision. He can  visualize the spatial relationship between  brain structures before he performs a  craniotomy and during the surgery he can see  what's under the next layer before he cuts  through. Given a video image of the patient  and a three dimensional model of the  patient's brain the problem enhanced reality  visualization faces is to render the model from  the correct viewpoint and overlay it on the  original image. The relationship between the  coordinate frames of the patient, the patient's  internal anatomy scans and the image plane  of the camera observing the patient must be  established. This problem is closely related to  the camera calibration problem. This report  presents a new approach to finding this  relationship and develops a system for  performing enhanced reality visualization in a  surgical environment. Immediately prior to  surgery a few circular fiducials are placed  near the surgical site. An initial registration of  video and internal data is performed using a  laser scanner. Following this, our method is  fully automatic, runs in nearly real-time, is  accurate to within a pixel, allows both patient  and camera motion, automatically corrects for  changes to the internal camera parameters  (focal length, focus, aperture, etc.) and  requires only a single image.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1544</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1544</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thread Scheduling Mechanisms for Multiple-Context Parallel Processors</field><field name="creator">Fiske, James A. Stuart</field><field name="description">Scheduling tasks to efficiently use the  available processor resources is crucial to  minimizing the runtime of applications on  shared-memory parallel processors. One  factor that contributes to poor processor  utilization is the idle time caused by long  latency operations, such as remote memory  references or processor synchronization  operations. One way of tolerating this latency  is to use a processor with multiple hardware  contexts that can rapidly switch to executing  another thread of computation whenever a  long latency operation occurs, thus increasing  processor utilization by overlapping  computation with communication. Although  multiple contexts are effective for tolerating  latency, this effectiveness can be limited by  memory and network bandwidth, by cache  interference effects among the multiple  contexts, and by critical tasks sharing  processor resources with less critical tasks.  This thesis presents techniques that increase  the effectiveness of multiple contexts by  intelligently scheduling threads to make more  efficient use of processor pipeline, bandwidth,  and cache resources. This thesis proposes  thread prioritization as a fundamental  mechanism for directing the thread schedule  on a multiple-context processor. A priority is  assigned to each thread either statically or  dynamically and is used by the thread  scheduler to decide which threads to load in  the contexts, and to decide which context to  switch to on a context switch. We develop a  multiple-context model that integrates both  cache and network effects, and shows how  thread prioritization can both maintain high  processor utilization, and limit increases in  critical path runtime caused by multithreading.  The model also shows that in order to be  effective in bandwidth limited applications,  thread prioritization must be extended to  prioritize memory requests. We show how  simple hardware can prioritize the running of  threads in the multiple contexts, and the  issuing of requests to both the local memory  and the network. Simulation experiments  show how thread prioritization is used in a  variety of applications. Thread prioritization  can improve the performance of  synchronization primitives by minimizing the  number of processor cycles wasted in  spinning and devoting more cycles to critical  threads. Thread prioritization can be used in  combination with other techniques to improve  cache performance and minimize cache  interference between different working sets in  the cache. For applications that are critical  path limited, thread prioritization can improve  performance by allowing processor resources  to be devoted preferentially to critical threads.  These experimental results show that thread  prioritization is a mechanism that can be used  to implement a wide range of scheduling  policies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1545</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1545</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embodiment and Manipulation Learning Process for a Humanoid Hand</field><field name="creator">Matsuoka, Yoky</field><field name="description">Babies are born with simple manipulation  capabilities such as reflexes to perceived  stimuli.

The technique does not require  information about the surface properties of the  object, besides its shape, and is robust with  respect to variations of illumination. In our  derivation, few assumptions are made about  the nature of the imaging process. As a result  the algorithms are quite general and can  foreseeably be used in a wide variety of  imaging situations. Experiments are  presented that demonstrate the approach  registering magnetic resonance (MR) images  with computed tomography (CT) images,  aligning a complex 3D object model to real  scenes including clutter and occlusion,  tracking a human head in a video sequence  and aligning a view-based 2D object model to  real images. The method is based on a  formulation of the mutual information between  the model and the image called EMMA. As  applied here the technique is intensity-based,  rather than feature-based. It works well in  domains where edge or gradient-magnitude  based methods have difficulty, yet it is more  robust than traditional correlation. Additionally,  it has an efficient implementation that is  based on stochastic approximation. Finally,  we will describe a number of additional real-world applications that can be solved  efficiently and reliably using EMMA. EMMA can  be used in machine learning to find maximally  informative projections of high-dimensional  data. EMMA can also be used to detect and  correct corruption in magnetic resonance  images (MRI).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1548</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1548</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parallel Coupled Micro-Macro Actuators</field><field name="creator">Morrell, John Bryant</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new actuator system  consisting of a micro-actuator and a macro-actuator coupled in parallel via a compliant  transmission. The system is called the  Parallel Coupled Micro-Macro Actuator, or  PaCMMA. In this system, the micro-actuator is  capable of high bandwidth force control due to  its low mass and direct-drive connection to  the output shaft. The compliant transmission  of the macro-actuator reduces the impedance  (stiffness) at the output shaft and increases  the dynamic range of force. Performance  improvement over single actuator systems  was expected in force control, impedance  control, force distortion and reduction of  transient impact forces. A set of quantitative  measures is proposed and the actuator  system is evaluated against them: Force  Control Bandwidth, Position Bandwidth,  Dynamic Range, Impact Force, Impedance  ("Backdriveability'"), Force Distortion and  Force Performance Space. Several theoretical  performance limits are derived from the  saturation limits of the system. A control law is  proposed and control system performance is  compared to the theoretical limits. A prototype  testbed was built using permanenent magnet  motors and an experimental comparison was  performed between this actuator concept and  two single actuator systems. The following  performance was observed: Force bandwidth  of 56Hz, Torque Dynamic Range of 800:1,  Peak Torque of 1040mNm, Minimum Torque  of 1.3mNm. Peak Impact Force was reduced  by an order of magnitude. Distortion at small  amplitudes was reduced substantially.  Backdriven impedance was reduced by 2-3  orders of magnitude. This actuator system  shows promise for manipulator design as  well as psychophysical tests of human  performance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1563</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1563</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Segmentation of Brain Tissue from Magnetic Resonance Images</field><field name="creator">Kapur, Tina</field><field name="description">Segmentation of medical imagery is a  challenging problem due to the complexity of  the images, as well as to the absence of  models of the anatomy that fully capture the  possible deformations in each structure.

That inquiry led, eventually, to  three powerful heuristics that are broadly  applicable in gradient-ascent programs: First,  remember the locations of local maxima and  restart the optimization program at a place  distant from previously located local maxima.  Second, adjust the size of probing steps to  suit the local nature of the terrain, shrinking  when probes do poorly and growing when  probes do well. And third, keep track of the  directions of recent successes, so as to  probe preferentially in the direction of most  rapid ascent. These algorithms lie at the core  of a novel optimization program that illustrates  the power to be had from deploying them  together. The efficacy of this program is  demonstrated on several test problems  selected from a variety of fields, including De  Jong's famous test-problem suite, the  traveling salesman problem, the problem of  coordinate registration for image guided  surgery, the energy minimization problem for  determining the shape of organic molecules,  and the problem of assessing the structure of  sedimentary deposits using seismic data.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1569</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1569</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Informational Complexity of Learning from Examples</field><field name="creator">Niyogi, Partha</field><field name="description">This thesis attempts to quantify the amount of  information needed to learn certain tasks.

We investigate this problem through the fabrication and simple control of a planar 2-DOF robotic finger inspired by anatomic consistency, self-containment, and adaptability. The robot is equipped with a tactile sensor array based on optical transducer technology whereby localized changes in light intensity within an illuminated foam substrate correspond to the distribution and magnitude of forces applied to the sensor surface plane.   The integration of tactile perception is a key component in realizing robotic systems which organically interact with the world. Such natural behavior is characterized by compliant performance that can initiate internal, and respond to external, force application in a dynamic environment. However, most of the current manipulators that support some form of haptic feedback either solely derive proprioceptive sensation or only limit tactile sensors to the mechanical fingertips. These constraints are due to the technological challenges involved in high resolution, multi-point tactile perception.  In this work, however, we take the opposite approach, emphasizing the role of full-finger tactile feedback in the refinement of manual capabilities. To this end, we propose and implement a control framework for sensorimotor coordination analogous to infant-level grasping and fixturing reflexes. This thesis details the mechanisms used to achieve these sensory, actuation, and control objectives, along with the design philosophies and biological influences behind them. The results of behavioral experiments with a simple tactilely-modulated control scheme are also described.

In architectural design, for  example, architects and their clients use experiential terms such as "private" or "open"  to describe spaces. If we are to build programs that can help designers during this  early-stage design, we must give those programs the capability to deal with concepts  on the level of such abstractions. The work reported in this thesis sought to do that,  focusing on two key questions: How are  abstract terms such as "private" and "open" translated  into physical form? How might one build a tool to assist designers with this process? The Architect's Collaborator (TAC) was built to  explore these issues. It is a design assistant that supports iterative design refinement, and  that represents and reasons about how experiential qualities are manifested in  physical form. Given a starting design and a  set of design goals, TAC explores the space of  possible designs in search of solutions that  satisfy the goals. It employs a strategy we've called  dependency-directed redesign: it evaluates a design with respect to a set of goals, then  uses an explanation of the evaluation to guide proposal and refinement of repair  suggestions; it then carries out the repair  suggestions to create new designs. A series of experiments was run to study  TAC's behavior. Issues of control structure,  goal set size, goal order, and modification operator  capabilities were explored. In addition, TAC's use as a design assistant was studied  in an experiment using a house in the  process of being redesigned. TAC's use as an  analysis tool was studied in an experiment  using Frank Lloyd Wright's Prairie houses.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2001-001</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2001-001</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Object Recognition with Pictorial Structures</field><field name="creator">Felzenszwalb, Pedro F.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a statistical framework for object recognition. The framework is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager nearly 30 years ago. The basic idea is to model an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. The problem of detecting an object in an image and the problem of learning an object model using training examples are naturally formulated under a statistical approach. We present efficient algorithms to solve these problems in our framework. We demonstrate our techniques by training models to represent faces and human bodies. The models are then used to locate the corresponding objects in novel images.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2001-002</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2001-002</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving Multi-class Text Classification with Naive Bayes</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Jason D.

Such documents represent a massive amount of information that is easily accessible. Seeking value in this huge collection requires organization; much of the work of organizing documents can be automated through text classification. The accuracy and our understanding of such systems greatly influences their usefulness. In this paper, we seek 1) to advance the understanding of commonly used text classification techniques, and 2) through that understanding, improve the tools that are available for text classification. We begin by clarifying the assumptions made in the derivation of Naive Bayes, noting basic properties and proposing ways for its extension and improvement. Next, we investigate the quality of Naive Bayes parameter estimates and their impact on classification. Our analysis leads to a theorem which gives an explanation for the improvements that can be found in multiclass classification with Naive Bayes using Error-Correcting Output Codes. We use experimental evidence on two commonly-used data sets to exhibit an application of the theorem. Finally, we show fundamental flaws in a commonly-used feature selection algorithm and develop a statistics-based framework for text feature selection. Greater understanding of Naive Bayes and the properties of text allows us to make better use of it in text classification.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2001-004</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">naive bayes</field><field name="subject">text</field><field name="subject">classification</field><field name="subject">feature selection</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2001-004</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling, Estimation, and Control of Robot-Soil Interactions</field><field name="creator">Hong, Won</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development of hardware, theory, and experimental methods to enable a robotic manipulator arm to interact with soils and estimate soil properties from interaction forces. Unlike the majority of robotic systems interacting with soil, our objective is parameter estimation, not excavation. To this end, we design our manipulator with a flat plate for easy modeling of interactions. By using a flat plate, we take advantage of the wealth of research on the similar problem of earth pressure on retaining walls.  There are a number of existing earth pressure models. These models typically provide estimates of force which are in uncertain relation to the true force. A recent technique, known as numerical limit analysis, provides upper and lower bounds on the true force. Predictions from the numerical limit analysis technique are shown to be in good agreement with other accepted models.  Experimental methods for plate insertion, soil-tool interface friction estimation, and control of applied forces on the soil are presented. In addition, a novel graphical technique for inverting the soil models is developed, which is an improvement over standard nonlinear optimization. This graphical technique utilizes the uncertainties associated with each set of force measurements to obtain all possible parameters which could have produced the measured forces.  The system is tested on three cohesionless soils, two in a loose state and one in a loose and dense state. The results are compared with friction angles obtained from direct shear tests. The results highlight a number of key points. Common assumptions are made in soil modeling. Most notably, the Mohr-Coulomb failure law and perfectly plastic behavior. In the direct shear tests, a marked dependence of friction angle on the normal stress at low stresses is found. This has ramifications for any study of friction done at low stresses. In addition, gradual failures are often observed for vertical tools and tools inclined away from the direction of motion. After accounting for the change in friction angle at low stresses, the results show good agreement with the direct shear values.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2001-007</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Robotics</field><field name="subject">Soil Modeling</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2001-007</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Programmable Self-Assembly: Constructing Global Shape using Biologically-inspire</field><field name="creator">Nagpal, Radhika</field><field name="description">In this thesis I present a language for  instructing a sheet of identically-programmed, flexible, autonomous  agents (``cells'') to assemble themselves into a predetermined  global shape, using local interactions. The global shape is described  as a folding construction on a continuous sheet, using a set of axioms  from paper-folding (origami). I provide a means of automatically  deriving the cell program, executed by all cells, from the global  shape description.  With this language, a wide variety of global  shapes and patterns can be synthesized, using only local interactions  between identically-programmed cells. Examples  include flat layered shapes, all plane Euclidean constructions, and a  variety of tessellation patterns. In contrast to approaches based on  cellular automata or evolution, the cell program is directly derived  from the global shape description and is composed from a small  number of biologically-inspired primitives: gradients, neighborhood query,  polarity inversion, cell-to-cell contact and flexible folding. The cell  programs are robust, without relying on regular cell  placement, global coordinates, or synchronous operation and can tolerate a  small amount of random cell death. I show that an average cell  neighborhood of 15 is sufficient to reliably self-assemble complex  shapes and geometric patterns on randomly distributed cells.  The language provides many insights into the  relationship between local and global descriptions of behavior,  such as the advantage of constructive languages, mechanisms for  achieving global robustness, and mechanisms for achieving scale-independent shapes from a single cell program. The language suggests a  mechanism by which many related shapes can be created by the same cell  program, in the manner of D'Arcy Thompson's famous coordinate  transformations. The thesis illuminates how complex morphology and  pattern can emerge from local interactions, and how one can engineer  robust self-assembly.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2001-008</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">self-organisation</field><field name="subject">multi agent</field><field name="subject">developmental biology</field><field name="subject">amorphous computing</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2001-008</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feature Point Detection and Curve Approximation for Early Processing of Freehand Sketches</field><field name="creator">Sezgin, Tevfik Metin</field><field name="description">Freehand sketching is both a natural and crucial part of design, yet is unsupported by current design automation software.

In applications from orthopedics to neurosurgery, it has a great value in maintaining up-to-date information about changes due to intervention. We propose a mutual information- based registration algorithm to establish the proper align- ment. For optimization purposes, we compare the perfor- mance of the non-gradient Powell method and two slightly di erent versions of a stochastic gradient ascent strategy: one using a sparsely sampled histogramming approach and the other Parzen windowing to carry out probability density approximation.   Our main contribution lies in adopting the stochastic ap- proximation scheme successfully applied in 3D-3D registra- tion problems to the 2D-3D scenario, which obviates the need for the generation of full DRRs at each iteration of pose op- timization. This facilitates a considerable savings in compu- tation expense. We also introduce a new probability density estimator for image intensities via sparse histogramming, de- rive gradient estimates for the density measures required by the maximization procedure and introduce the framework for a multiresolution strategy to the problem.

Search is only likely to succeed in resource-bounded agents if they have already  been biased towards finding the right answer.  In artificial agents, the primary source of bias is engineering.   This dissertation describes an approach,  Behavior-Oriented Design (BOD) for  engineering complex agents. A complex agent  is one that must arbitrate between potentially  conflicting goals or behaviors.  Behavior-oriented design builds on work in  behavior-based and hybrid architectures for agents, and the object  oriented approach to software engineering.   The primary contributions of this dissertation  are:     1.The BOD architecture: a modular  architecture with each module providing  specialized representations to facilitate  learning.    This includes one pre-specified module  and representation for action selection or  behavior arbitration. The specialized    representation underlying BOD action  selection is Parallel-rooted, Ordered,  Slip-stack Hierarchical (POSH) reactive plans.     2.The BOD development process: an  iterative process that alternately scales the  agent's capabilities then optimizes the agent  for    simplicity, exploiting tradeoffs between the  component representations. This ongoing  process for controlling complexity not only    provides bias for the behaving agent, but  also facilitates its maintenance and  extendibility.   The secondary contributions of this  dissertation include two implementations of  POSH action selection, a procedure for  identifying useful idioms in agent architectures and  using them to distribute knowledge across  agent paradigms, several examples of  applying BOD idioms to established architectures, an  analysis and comparison of the attributes and  design trends of a large number of agent architectures, a comparison of biological  (particularly mammalian) intelligence to  artificial agent architectures, a novel model of primate transitive inference, and many other  examples of BOD agents and BOD  development.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2002-003</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2002-003</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automated Reasoning About Classical Mechanics</field><field name="creator">Wong, Leon</field><field name="description">In recent years, researchers in artificial  intelligence have become interested in  replicating human physical reasoning talents  in computers.

Discussion about the  design of this program identifies a physical  reasoning paradigm and knowledge  representation approach based on  mathematical model construction and  algebraic reasoning.

This thesis develops a  control scheme called virtual model control  which addresses this issue. Virtual model  control is a motion control language which  uses simulations of imagined mechanical  components to create forces, which are  applied through joint torques, thereby creating  the illusion that the components are  connected to the robot. Due to the intuitive  nature of this technique, designing a virtual  model controller requires the same skills as  designing the mechanism itself. A high level  control system can be cascaded with the low  level virtual model controller to modulate the  parameters of the virtual mechanisms.  Discrete commands from the high level  controller would then result in fluid motion. An  extension of Gardner's Partitioned Actuator  Set Control method is developed. This  method allows for the specification of  constraints on the generalized forces which  each serial path of a parallel mechanism can  apply. Virtual model control has been applied  to a bipedal walking robot. A simple algorithm  utilizing a simple set of virtual components  has successfully compelled the robot to walk  eight consecutive steps.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1581</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1581</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual Model Control of a Hexapod Walking Robot</field><field name="creator">Torres, Ann L.</field><field name="description">Since robots are typically designed with an  individual actuator at each joint, the control of  these systems is often difficult and non-intuitive. This thesis explains a more intuitive  control scheme called Virtual Model Control.  This thesis also demonstrates the simplicity  and ease of this control method by using it to  control a simulated walking hexapod. Virtual  Model Control uses imagined mechanical  components to create virtual forces, which are  applied through the joint torques of real  actuators. This method produces a  straightforward means of controlling joint  torques to produce a desired robot behavior.  Due to the intuitive nature of this control  scheme, the design of a virtual model  controller is similar to the design of a  controller with basic mechanical components.  The ease of this control scheme facilitates the  use of a high level control system which can  be used above the low level virtual model  controllers to modulate the parameters of the  imaginary mechanical components. In order  to apply Virtual Model Control to parallel  mechanisms, a solution to the force  distribution problem is required. This thesis  uses an extension of Gardner`s Partitioned  Force Control method which allows for the  specification of constrained degrees of  freedom. This virtual model control technique  was applied to a simulated hexapod robot.  Although the hexapod is a highly non-linear,  parallel mechanism, the virtual models  allowed text-book control solutions to be used  while the robot was walking. Using a simple  linear control law, the robot walked while  simultaneously balancing a pendulum and  tracking an object.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1582</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1582</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prototype of a Configurable Web-Based Assessment System</field><field name="creator">Hall, Miguel</field><field name="description">The MIT Prototype Educational Assessment  System provides subjects and courses at MIT  with the ability to perform online assessment.

The  key idea is the notion of "linearity". A name is  linear if it is only used once, so with linear  naming you cannot create more than one  outstanding reference to an entity. As a result,  linear naming is cheap to support and easy to  reason about. Programs can be translated  into the linear graph reduction model such  that linear names in the program are  implemented directly as linear names in the  model. Nonlinear names are supported by  constructing them out of linear names. The  translation thus exposes those places where  the program uses names in expensive,  nonlinear ways. Two applications  demonstrate the utility of using linear graph  reduction: First, in the area of distributed  computing, linear naming makes it easy to  support cheap cross-network references and  highly portable data structures, Linear naming  also facilitates demand driven migration of  tasks and data around the network without  requiring explicit guidance from the  programmer. Second, linear graph reduction  reveals a new characterization of the  phenomenon of state. Systems in which state  appears are those which depend on certain -global- system properties. State is not a  localizable phenomenon, which suggests that  our usual object oriented metaphor for state is  flawed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1627</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1627</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Micromotors</field><field name="creator">Flynn, Anita M.</field><field name="description">This report describes development of micro-fabricated piezoelectric ultrasonic motors and  bulk-ceramic piezoelectric ultrasonic motors.  Ultrasonic motors offer the advantage of low  speed, high torque operation without the need  for gears. They can be made compact and  lightweight and provide a holding torque in the  absence of applied power, due to the traveling  wave frictional coupling mechanism between  the rotor and the stator. This report covers  modeling, simulation, fabrication and testing  of ultrasonic motors. Design of experiments  methods were also utilized to find optimal  motor parameters. A suite of 8 mm diameter x  3 mm tall motors were machined for these  studies and maximum stall torques as large  as 10^(- 3) Nm, maximum no-load speeds of  1710 rpm and peak power outputs of 27 mW  were realized. Aditionally, this report  describes the implementation of a  microfabricated ultrasonic motor using thin-film lead zirconate titanate. In a joint project  with the Pennsylvania State University  Materials Research Laboratory and MIT  Lincoln Laboratory, 2 mm and 5 mm diameter  stator structures were fabricated on 1 micron  thick silicon nitride membranes. Small glass  lenses placed down on top spun at 100-300  rpm with 4 V excitation at 90 kHz.

A bag  is labeled negative if all instances in it are  negative. A bag is labeled positive if at least  one instance in it is positive. Because the  instances themselves are not labeled, each  positive bag is an ambiguous example. We  would like to learn a concept which will  correctly classify unseen bags. We have  developed a measure called Diverse Density  and algorithms for learning from multiple-instance examples.

We have designed  the Protocol for Hierarchical Directories (PHD)  to allow shared-memory support for systems  containing massive numbers of processors.  PHD eliminates bandwidth problems by using  a scalable network, decreases hot-spots by  not relying on a single point to distribute  blocks, and uses a scalable amount of space  for its directories. PHD provides a shared-memory model by synthesizing a global  shared memory from the local memories of  processors. PHD supports sequentially  consistent read, write, and test- and-set  operations. This thesis also introduces a  method of describing locality for hierarchical  protocols and employs this method in the  derivation of an abstract model of the protocol  behavior. An embedded model, based on the  work of Johnson[ISCA19], describes the  protocol behavior when mapped to a k-ary n-cube. The thesis uses these two models to  study the average height in the hierarchy that  operations reach, the longest path messages  travel, the number of messages that  operations generate, the inter-transaction  issue time, and the protocol overhead for  different locality parameters, degrees of  multithreading, and machine sizes. We  determine that multithreading is only useful  for approximately two to four threads; any  additional interleaving does not decrease the  overall latency. For small machines and high  locality applications, this limitation is due  mainly to the length of the running threads.  For large machines with medium to low  locality, this limitation is due mainly to the  protocol overhead being too large. Our study  using the embedded model shows that in  situations where the run length between  references to shared memory is at least an  order of magnitude longer than the time to  process a single state transition in the  protocol, applications exhibit good  performance. If separate controllers for  processing protocol requests are included,  the protocol scales to 32k processor  machines as long as the application exhibits  hierarchical locality: at least 22% of the global  references must be able to be satisfied  locally; at most 35% of the global references  are allowed to reach the top level of the  hierarchy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1645</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1645</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maximum Entropy Discrimination</field><field name="creator">Jaakkola, Tommi</field><field name="description">We present a general framework for  discriminative estimation based on the  maximum entropy principle and its  extensions.

This  holds even when the data is not separable  within the chosen parametric class, in the  context of anomaly detection rather than  classification, or when the labels in the  training set are uncertain or incomplete.  Support vector machines are naturally  subsumed under this class and we provide  several extensions. We are also able to  estimate exactly and efficiently discriminative  distributions over tree structures of class-conditional models within this framework.

We define RP-space, a restricted domain of  the general-purpose architectural space  focussed on reconfigurable computing  architectures. Two dominant features  differentiate reconfigurable from special-purpose architectures and account for most of  the area overhead associated with RP  devices: (1) instructions which tell the device  how to behave, and (2) flexible interconnect  which supports task dependent dataflow  between operations. We can characterize RP-space by the allocation and structure of these  resources and compare the efficiencies of  architectural points across broad application  characteristics. Conventional FPGAs fall at  one extreme end of this space and their  efficiency ranges over two orders of  magnitude across the space of application  characteristics. Understanding RP-space and  its consequences allows us to pick the best  architecture for a task and to search for more  robust design points in the space. Our DPGA,  a fine- grained computing device which adds  small, on-chip instruction memories to FPGAs  is one such design point. For typical logic  applications and finite- state machines, a  DPGA can implement tasks in one-third the  area of a traditional FPGA. TSFPGA, a variant  of the DPGA which focuses on heavily time-switched interconnect, achieves circuit  densities close to the DPGA, while reducing  typical physical mapping times from hours to  seconds. Rigid, fabrication-time organization  of instruction resources significantly narrows  the range of efficiency for conventional  architectures. To avoid this performance  brittleness, we developed MATRIX, the first  architecture to defer the binding of instruction  resources until run-time, allowing the  application to organize resources according to  its needs. Our focus MATRIX design point is  based on an array of 8-bit ALU and register-file building blocks interconnected via a byte-wide network. With today's silicon, a single  chip MATRIX array can deliver over 10 Gop/s  (8-bit ops). On sample image processing  tasks, we show that MATRIX yields 10-20x the  computational density of conventional  processors. Understanding the cost structure  of RP-space helps us identify these  intermediate architectural points and may  provide useful insight more broadly in guiding  our continual search for robust and efficient  general-purpose computing structures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-1586</field><field name="identifier">AITR-1586</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Virtual Machine for a Type-omega Denotational Proof Language</field><field name="creator">III, Teodoro Arvizo</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I designed and implemented a  virtual machine (VM) for a monomorphic  variant of Athena, a type-omega denotational  proof language (DPL).

The number of clock cycles to span  a chip are increasing, while the number of bits that can be accessed  within a clock cycle is decreasing. Hence, it is becoming more  difficult to hide latency. One alternative solution is to reduce latency by  migrating threads and data, but the overhead of existing  implementations has previously made migration an unserviceable solution so  far.  I present an architecture, implementation, and  mechanisms that reduces the overhead of migration to the point where  migration is a viable supplement to other latency hiding  mechanisms, such as multithreading. The architecture is abstract,  and presents programmers with a simple, uniform fine-grained  multithreaded parallel programming model with implicit memory management. In  other words, the spatial nature and implementation details (such as  the number of processors) of a parallel machine are entirely hidden from  the programmer. Compiler writers are  encouraged to devise programming languages for the machine that guide a  programmer to express their ideas in terms of objects, since objects exhibit  an inherent physical locality of data and code. The machine  implementation can then leverage this locality to automatically distribute  data and threads across the physical machine by using a set of  high performance migration mechanisms.  An implementation of this architecture could  migrate a null thread in 66 cycles -- over a factor of 1000 improvement  over previous work. Performance also scales well; the time  required to move a typical thread is only 4 to 5 times that of a null  thread. Data migration performance is similar, and scales  linearly with data block size. Since the performance of the migration  mechanism is on par with that of an L2 cache, the implementation  simulated in my work has no data caches and relies instead on  multithreading and the migration mechanism to hide and reduce access  latencies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2002-006</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">HPC parallel computer architecture queues fault tolerance programmability ADAM</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2002-006</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface Reflectance Recognition and Real-World Illumination Statistics</field><field name="creator">Dror, Ron O.</field><field name="description">Humans distinguish materials such as metal, plastic, and paper effortlessly at a glance. Traditional computer vision systems cannot solve this problem at all. Recognizing surface reflectance properties from a single photograph is difficult because the observed image depends heavily on the amount of light incident from every direction. A mirrored sphere, for example, produces a different image in every environment. To make matters worse, two surfaces with different reflectance properties could produce identical images. The mirrored sphere simply reflects its surroundings, so in the right artificial setting, it could mimic the appearance of a matte ping-pong ball. Yet, humans possess an intuitive sense of what materials typically "look like" in the real world. This thesis develops computational algorithms with a similar ability to recognize reflectance properties from photographs under unknown, real-world illumination conditions.   Real-world illumination is complex, with light typically incident on a surface from every direction. We find, however, that real-world illumination patterns are not arbitrary. They exhibit highly predictable spatial structure, which we describe largely in the wavelet domain. Although they differ in several respects from the typical photographs, illumination patterns share much of the regularity described in the natural image statistics literature.   These properties of real-world illumination lead to predictable image statistics for a surface with given reflectance properties. We construct a system that classifies a surface according to its reflectance from a single photograph under unknown illuminination. Our algorithm learns relationships between surface reflectance and certain statistics computed from the observed image. Like the human visual system, we solve the otherwise underconstrained inverse problem of reflectance estimation by taking advantage of the statistical regularity of illumination. For surfaces with homogeneous reflectance properties and known geometry, our system rivals human performance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2002-009</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">illumination</field><field name="subject">reflectance</field><field name="subject">natural image statistics</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">materials</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2002-009</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achieving Real-Time Mode Estimation through Offline Compilation</field><field name="creator">Van Eepoel, John M.</field><field name="description">As exploration of our solar system and outerspace move into the future, spacecraft are being developed to venture on increasingly challenging missions with bold objectives. The spacecraft tasked with completing  these missions are becoming progressively more complex. This  increases the potential for mission failure due to hardware malfunctions  and unexpected spacecraft behavior. A solution to this problem lies in the  development of an advanced fault management system. Fault  management enables spacecraft to respond to failures and take repair  actions so that it may continue its mission. The two main approaches  developed for spacecraft fault management have been rule-based and  model-based systems. Rules map sensor information to system  behaviors, thus achieving fast response times, and making the actions of  the fault management system explicit. These rules are developed by  having a human reason through the interactions between spacecraft  components. This process is limited by the number of interactions a  human can reason about correctly. In the model-based approach, the  human provides component models, and the fault management system  reasons automatically about system wide interactions and complex fault combinations. This approach improves correctness, and makes explicit  the underlying system models, whereas these are implicit in the rule-based approach. We propose a fault detection engine, Compiled Mode  Estimation (CME) that unifies the strengths of the rule-based and model-based approaches. CME uses a compiled model to determine spacecraft  behavior more accurately. Reasoning related to fault detection is  compiled in an off-line process into a set of concurrent, localized  diagnostic rules. These are then combined on-line along with sensor  information to reconstruct the diagnosis of the system. These rules  enable a human to inspect the diagnostic consequences of CME.  Additionally, CME is capable of reasoning through component  interactions automatically and still provide fast and correct responses.  The implementation of this engine has been tested against the NEAR  spacecraft advanced rule-based system, resulting in detection of failures  beyond that of the rules. This evolution in fault detection will enable future  missions to explore the furthest reaches of the solar system without the  burden of human intervention to repair failed components.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2002-010</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">mode estimation</field><field name="subject">compilation</field><field name="subject">model-based</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2002-010</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Subsystems in Biology through Dimensionality Reduction, Graph Partitioning and Analytical Modeling</field><field name="creator">Kim, Philip Mjong-Hyon Shin</field><field name="description">Biological systems exhibit rich and complex behavior through the orchestrated interplay of a large array of components. It is hypothesized that separable subsystems with some degree of functional autonomy exist; deciphering their independent behavior and functionality would greatly facilitate understanding the system as a whole. Discovering and analyzing such subsystems are hence pivotal problems in the quest to gain a quantitative understanding of complex biological systems.  In this work, using approaches from machine learning, physics and graph theory, methods for the identification and analysis of such subsystems were developed. A novel methodology, based on a recent machine learning algorithm known as non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), was developed to discover such subsystems in a set of large-scale gene expression data. This set of subsystems was then used to predict functional relationships between genes, and this approach was shown to score significantly higher than conventional methods when benchmarking them against existing databases. Moreover, a mathematical treatment was developed to treat simple network subsystems based only on their topology (independent of particular parameter values). Application to a problem of experimental interest demonstrated the need for extentions to the conventional model to fully explain the experimental data.  Finally, the notion of a subsystem was evaluated from a topological perspective. A number of different protein networks were examined to analyze their topological properties with respect to separability, seeking to find separable subsystems. These networks were shown to exhibit separability in a nonintuitive fashion, while the separable subsystems were of strong biological significance. It was demonstrated that the separability property found was not due to incomplete or biased data, but is likely to reflect biological structure.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-001</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-001</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using Analogy to Acquire Commonsense Knowledge from Human Contributors</field><field name="creator">Chklovski, Timothy</field><field name="description">The goal of the work reported here is to capture the  commonsense knowledge of non-expert human  contributors. Achieving this goal will enable more  intelligent human-computer interfaces and pave the  way for computers to reason about our world. In the  domain of natural language processing, it will provide  the world knowledge much needed for semantic  processing of natural language. To acquire knowledge  from contributors not trained in knowledge engineering,  I take the following four steps: (i) develop a knowledge  representation (KR) model for simple assertions in  natural language, (ii) introduce cumulative analogy, a  class of nearest-neighbor based analogical reasoning  algorithms over this representation, (iii) argue that  cumulative analogy is well suited for knowledge  acquisition (KA) based on a theoretical analysis of  effectiveness of KA with this approach, and (iv) test the  KR model and the effectiveness of the cumulative  analogy algorithms empirically. To investigate  effectiveness of cumulative analogy for KA empirically,  Learner, an open source system for KA by cumulative  analogy has been implemented, deployed, and  evaluated. (The site "1001 Questions," is available at  http://teach-computers.org/learner.html). Learner  acquires assertion-level knowledge by constructing  shallow semantic analogies between a KA topic and its  nearest neighbors and posing these analogies as  natural language questions to human contributors.  Suppose, for example, that based on the knowledge  about "newspapers" already present in the knowledge  base, Learner judges "newspaper" to be similar to  "book" and "magazine." Further suppose that  assertions "books contain information" and "magazines  contain information" are also already in the knowledge  base. Then Learner will use cumulative analogy from  the similar topics to ask humans whether "newspapers  contain information." Because similarity between topics  is computed based on what is already known about  them, Learner exhibits bootstrapping behavior --- the  quality of its questions improves as it gathers more  knowledge. By summing evidence for and against  posing any given question, Learner also exhibits noise  tolerance, limiting the effect of incorrect similarities. The  KA power of shallow semantic analogy from nearest  neighbors is one of the main findings of this thesis. I  perform an analysis of commonsense knowledge  collected by another research effort that did not rely on  analogical reasoning and demonstrate that indeed  there is sufficient amount of correlation in the  knowledge base to motivate using cumulative analogy  from nearest neighbors as a KA method. Empirically,  evaluating the percentages of questions answered  affirmatively, negatively and judged to be nonsensical  in the cumulative analogy case compares favorably  with the baseline, no-similarity case that relies on  random objects rather than nearest neighbors. Of the  questions generated by cumulative analogy,  contributors answered 45% affirmatively, 28%  negatively and marked 13% as nonsensical; in the  control, no-similarity case 8% of questions were  answered affirmatively, 60% negatively and 26% were  marked as nonsensical.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-002</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">knowledge acquisition</field><field name="subject">knowledge capture</field><field name="subject">analogy</field><field name="subject">natural language</field><field name="subject">reasoning</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-002</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement Learning by Policy Search</field><field name="creator">Peshkin, Leonid</field><field name="description">One objective of artificial intelligence is to model the  behavior of an intelligent agent interacting with its environment. The  environment's transformations can be modeled as a Markov chain,  whose state is partially observable to the agent and affected by its actions;  such processes are known as partially observable Markov decision processes  (POMDPs). While the environment's dynamics are assumed to obey certain  rules, the agent does not know them and must learn.  In this dissertation we focus on the agent's adaptation  as captured by the reinforcement learning framework. This means learning  a policy---a mapping of observations into actions---based  on feedback from the environment. The learning can be viewed as browsing  a set of policies while evaluating them by trial through interaction with the  environment.  The set of policies is constrained by the architecture of  the agent's controller. POMDPs require a controller to have  a memory. We investigate controllers with memory, including  controllers with  external memory, finite state controllers and distributed  controllers for multi-agent systems. For these various  controllers we work out the details of the algorithms which learn by ascending  the gradient of expected cumulative reinforcement.   Building on statistical learning theory and experiment  design theory, a policy evaluation algorithm is developed for the case of  experience re-use. We address the question of sufficient experience for  uniform convergence of policy evaluation and obtain sample complexity bounds  for various estimators. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the  proposed algorithms on several domains, the most complex of which is simulated  adaptive packet routing in a telecommunication network.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-003</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">POMDP</field><field name="subject">policy search</field><field name="subject">adaptive systems</field><field name="subject">reinforcement learning</field><field name="subject">adaptive behavior</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-003</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereo-Based Head Pose Tracking Using Iterative Closest Point and Normal Flow Constraint</field><field name="creator">Morency, Louis-Philippe</field><field name="description">In this text, we present two stereo-based head tracking  techniques along with a fast 3D model acquisition  system. The first tracking technique is a robust  implementation of stereo-based head tracking  designed for interactive environments with uncontrolled  lighting. We integrate fast face detection and drift  reduction algorithms with a gradient-based stereo rigid  motion tracking technique. Our system can  automatically segment and track a user's head under large rotation and illumination variations. Precision and  usability of this approach are compared with previous  tracking methods for cursor control and target selection  in both desktop and interactive room environments.  The second tracking technique is designed to improve  the robustness of head pose tracking for fast  movements. Our iterative hybrid tracker combines  constraints from the ICP (Iterative Closest Point)  algorithm and normal flow constraint. This new  technique is more precise for small movements and  noisy depth than ICP alone, and more robust for large  movements than the normal flow constraint alone. We present experiments which  test the accuracy of our approach on sequences of real  and synthetic stereo images.  The 3D model acquisition system we present quickly  aligns intensity and depth images, and reconstructs a  textured 3D mesh. 3D views are registered with shape  alignment based on our iterative hybrid tracker. We  reconstruct the 3D model using a new Cubic Ray  Projection merging algorithm which takes advantage of  a novel data structure: the linked voxel space. We  present experiments to test the accuracy of our  approach on 3D face modelling using real-time stereo  images.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-006</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Head pose estimation</field><field name="subject">Stereo processing</field><field name="subject">Cursor control</field><field name="subject">3D model acquisition</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-006</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Segmentation and Alignment of Speech and Sketching in a Design Environment</field><field name="creator">Adler, Aaron D.</field><field name="description">Sketches are commonly used in the early stages of  design.

The 3D shape of a class of  objects is represented by sets of contours from  silhouette views simultaneously observed from multiple  calibrated cameras. Bayesian reconstructions of new  shapes are then estimated using a prior density constructed with a mixture model and probabilistic  principal components analysis. We show how the use  of a class-specific prior in a visual hull reconstruction  can reduce the effect of segmentation errors from the  silhouette extraction process. The proposed method is  applied to a data set of pedestrian images, and  improvements in the approximate 3D models under  various noise conditions are shown. We further  augment the shape model to incorporate structural  features of interest; unknown structural parameters for a  novel set of contours are then inferred via the Bayesian  reconstruction process. Model matching and parameter  inference are done entirely in the image domain and  require no explicit 3D construction. Our shape model  enables accurate estimation of structure despite  segmentation errors or missing views in the input  silhouettes, and works even with only a single input  view.

It shows  that a robotic platform can build up and maintain a  system for object localization, segmentation, and  recognition, starting from very little. What the robot  starts with is a direct solution to achieving figure/ground  separation: it simply 'pokes around' in a region of visual  ambiguity and watches what happens. If the arm  passes through an area, that area is recognized as free  space. If the arm collides with an object, causing it to  move, the robot can use that motion to segment the  object from the background. Once the robot can  acquire reliable segmented views of objects, it learns  from them, and from then on recognizes and segments  those objects without further contact. Both low-level and  high-level visual features can also be learned in this  way, and examples are presented for both: orientation  detection and affordance recognition, respectively. The  motivation for this work is simple. Training on large  corpora of annotated real-world data has proven crucial  for creating robust solutions to perceptual problems  such as speech recognition and face detection. But the  powerful tools used during training of such systems are  typically stripped away at deployment. Ideally they  should remain, particularly for unstable tasks such as  object detection, where the set of objects needed in a  task tomorrow might be different from the set of objects  needed today. The key limiting factor is access to  training data, but as this thesis shows, that need not be  a problem on a robotic platform that can actively probe  its environment, and carry out experiments to resolve  ambiguity. This work is an instance of a general  approach to learning a new perceptual judgment:  find special situations in which the perceptual judgment  is easy and study these situations to find correlated  features that can be observed more generally.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-008</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-008</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Safe Distributed Coordination of Heterogeneous Robots through Dynamic Simple Temporal Networks</field><field name="creator">Wehowsky, Andreas F.</field><field name="description">Research on autonomous intelligent systems has focused on how robots can robustly carry out missions in uncertain and harsh environments with very little or no human intervention. Robotic execution languages such as RAPs, ESL, and TDL improve robustness by managing functionally redundant procedures for achieving goals. The model-based programming approach extends this by guaranteeing correctness of execution through pre-planning of non-deterministic timed threads of activities. Executing model-based programs effectively on distributed autonomous platforms requires distributing this pre-planning process. This thesis presents a distributed planner for modelbased programs whose planning and execution is distributed among agents with widely varying levels of processor power and memory resources. We make two key contributions. First, we reformulate a model-based program, which describes cooperative activities, into a hierarchical dynamic simple temporal network. This enables efficient distributed coordination of robots and supports deployment on heterogeneous robots. Second, we introduce a distributed temporal planner, called DTP, which solves hierarchical dynamic simple temporal networks with the assistance of the distributed Bellman-Ford shortest path algorithm. The implementation of DTP has been demonstrated successfully on a wide range of randomly generated examples and on a pursuer-evader challenge problem in simulation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-012</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">model-based autonomy</field><field name="subject">distributed planning</field><field name="subject">distributed constraint satisfaction</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-012</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Online Learning of Non-stationary Sequences</field><field name="creator">Monteleoni, Claire</field><field name="description">We consider an online learning scenario in which the learner can make predictions on the basis of a fixed set of experts.

We derive a new performance bound for such algorithms which is considerably simpler than existing bounds. The bound provides the basis for learning the rate at which the identity of the optimal expert switches over time. We find an analytic expression for the a priori resolution at which we need to learn the rate parameter.

Techniques for visual processing, object recognition, emotional response, gesture production and recognition, etc., are necessary components of a complete humanoid robot. However, most projects invariably concentrate on developing a few of these individual components, neglecting the issue of how all of these pieces would eventually fit together.  The focus of the work in this dissertation is on creating a framework into which such specific competencies can be embedded, in a way that they can interact with each other and build layers of new functionality. To be of any practical value, such a framework must satisfy the real-world constraints of functioning in real-time with noisy sensors and actuators. The humanoid robot Cog provides an unapologetically adequate platform from which to take on such a challenge.  This work makes three contributions to embodied AI. First, it offers a general-purpose architecture for developing behavior-based systems distributed over networks of PC's. Second, it provides a motor-control system that simulates several biological features which impact the development of motor behavior. Third, it develops a framework for a system which enables a robot to learn new behaviors via interacting with itself and the outside world. A few basic functional modules are built into this framework, enough to demonstrate the robot learning some very simple behaviors taught by a human trainer.  A primary motivation for this project is the notion that it is practically impossible to build an "intelligent" machine unless it is designed partly to build itself. This work is a proof-of-concept of such an approach to integrating multiple perceptual and motor systems into a complete learning agent.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-013</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">cog humanoid robot embodied learning phd thesis metaphor pancake reaching vision</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-013</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gait Analysis for Classification</field><field name="creator">Lee, Lily</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a representation of gait appearance for the purpose of person identification and classification.

Images of anatomical structures typically have uniform intensity interiors and smooth boundaries. We create methods to represent such regions compactly using tetrahedra. Unlike voxel-based representations, tetrahedra can accurately describe the expected smooth surfaces of medical objects. Furthermore, the interior of such objects can be represented using a small number of tetrahedra. Rather than describing a medical object using tens of thousands of voxels, our representations generally contain only a few thousand elements.  Tetrahedra facilitate the creation of efficient non-rigid registration algorithms based on finite element methods (FEM). We create a fast, FEM-based method to non-rigidly register segmented anatomical structures from two subjects. Using our compact tetrahedral representations, this method generally requires less than one minute of processing time on a desktop PC.  We also create a novel method for the non-rigid registration of gray scale images. To facilitate a fast method, we create a tetrahedral representation of a displacement field that automatically adapts to both the anatomy in an image and to the displacement field. The resulting algorithm has a computational cost that is dominated by the number of nodes in the mesh (about 10,000), rather than the number of voxels in an image (nearly 10,000,000). For many non-rigid registration problems, we can find a transformation from one image to another in five minutes. This speed is important as it allows use of the algorithm during surgery.  We apply our algorithms to find correlations between the shape of anatomical structures and the presence of schizophrenia. We show that a study based on our representations outperforms studies based on other representations. We also use the results of our non-rigid registration algorithm as the basis of a segmentation algorithm.

This representation is similar to the medial axis transform and has important properties from a computational perspective. The first problem we consider is the detection of non-rigid objects in images using deformable models. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem in a wide range of situations, and show examples in both natural and medical images. We also consider the problem of learning an accurate non-rigid shape model for a class of objects from examples. We show how to learn good models while constraining them to the form required by the detection algorithm. Finally, we consider the problem of low-level image segmentation and grouping. We describe a stochastic grammar that generates arbitrary triangulated polygons while capturing Gestalt principles of shape regularity. This grammar is used as a prior model over random shapes in a low level algorithm that detects objects in images.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-016</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-016</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorescence Assay for Polymerase Arrival Rates</field><field name="creator">Che, Austin</field><field name="description">To engineer complex synthetic biological systems will require modular design, assembly, and characterization strategies. The RNA polymerase arrival rate (PAR) is defined to be the rate that RNA polymerases arrive at a specified location on the DNA. Designing and characterizing biological modules in terms of RNA polymerase arrival rates provides for many advantages in the construction and modeling of biological systems.  PARMESAN is an in vitro method for measuring polymerase arrival rates using pyrrolo-dC, a fluorescent DNA base that can substitute for cytosine. Pyrrolo-dC shows a detectable fluorescence difference when in single-stranded versus double-stranded DNA. During transcription, RNA polymerase separates the two strands of DNA, leading to a change in the fluorescence of pyrrolo-dC. By incorporating pyrrolo-dC at specific locations in the DNA, fluorescence changes can be taken as a direct measurement of the polymerase arrival rate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2003-017</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2003-017</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generative Temporal Planning with Complex Processes</field><field name="creator">Kennell, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Autonomous vehicles are increasingly being used in mission-critical applications, and robust methods are needed for controlling these inherently unreliable and complex systems. This thesis advocates the use of model-based programming, which allows mission designers to program autonomous missions at the level of a coach or wing commander. To support such a system, this thesis presents the Spock generative planner. To generate plans, Spock must be able to piece together vehicle commands and team tactics that have a complex behavior represented by concurrent processes. This is in contrast to traditional planners, whose operators represent simple atomic or durative actions. Spock represents operators using the RMPL language, which describes behaviors using parallel and sequential compositions of state and activity episodes. RMPL is useful for controlling mobile autonomous missions because it allows mission designers to quickly encode expressive activity models using object-oriented design methods and an intuitive set of activity combinators. Spock also is significant in that it uniformly represents operators and plan-space processes in terms of Temporal Plan Networks, which support temporal flexibility for robust plan execution. Finally, Spock is implemented as a forward progression optimal planner that walks monotonically forward through plan processes, closing any open conditions and resolving any conflicts. This thesis describes the Spock algorithm in detail, along with example problems and test results.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2004-002</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">planning "temporal planning"</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2004-002</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Commonsense Categorical Knowledge in a Thread Memory System</field><field name="creator">Stamatoiu, Oana L.</field><field name="description">If we are to understand how we can build machines capable of broad purpose learning and reasoning, we must first aim to build systems that can represent, acquire, and reason about the kinds of commonsense knowledge that we humans have about the world. This endeavor suggests steps such as identifying the kinds of knowledge people commonly have about the world, constructing suitable knowledge representations, and exploring the mechanisms that people use to make judgments about the everyday world. In this work, I contribute to these goals by proposing an architecture for a system that can learn commonsense knowledge about the properties and behavior of objects in the world. The architecture described here augments previous machine learning systems in four ways: (1) it relies on a seven dimensional notion of context, built from information recently given to the system, to learn and reason about objects' properties; (2) it has multiple methods that it can use to reason about objects, so that when one method fails, it can fall back on others; (3) it illustrates the usefulness of reasoning about objects by thinking about their similarity to other, better known objects, and by inferring properties of objects from the categories that they belong to; and (4) it represents an attempt to build an autonomous learner and reasoner, that sets its own goals for learning about the world and deduces new facts by reflecting on its acquired knowledge. This thesis describes this architecture, as well as a first implementation, that can learn from sentences such as ``A blue bird flew to the tree'' and ``The small bird flew to the cage'' that birds can fly. One of the main contributions of this work lies in suggesting a further set of salient ideas about how we can build broader purpose commonsense artificial learners and reasoners.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2004-001</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">context</field><field name="subject">categorization</field><field name="subject">similarity</field><field name="subject">Bridge</field><field name="subject">thread memory</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2004-001</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BioJADE: A Design and Simulation Tool for Synthetic Biological Systems</field><field name="creator">Goler, Jonathan A.</field><field name="description">The next generations of both biological engineering and computer engineering demand that control be  exerted at the molecular level.

To develop these systems, we must have a set of tools not  only for synthesizing systems, but also designing and simulating them. The BioJADE project provides a  comprehensive, extensible design and simulation platform for synthetic biology. BioJADE is a graphical  design tool built in Java, utilizing a database back end, and supports a range of simulations using an  XML communication protocol. BioJADE currently supports a library of over 100 parts with which it can  compile designs into actual DNA, and then generate synthesis instructions to build the physical parts.  The BioJADE project contributes several tools to Synthetic Biology. BioJADE in itself is a powerful tool for  synthetic biology designers.

Each approach suffers from  particular drawbacks. High-level AI uses abstractions that often have no relation to the way real,  biological brains work. Low-level AI, on the other hand, tends to lack the powerful abstractions that are  needed to express complex structures and relationships. I have tried to combine the best features of  both approaches, by building a set of programming abstractions defined in terms of simple, biologically  plausible components. At the ``ground level'', I define a primitive, perceptron-like computational unit.  I then show how more abstract computational units may be implemented in terms of the primitive  units, and show the utility of the abstract units in sample networks. The new units make it possible to  build networks using concepts such as long-term memories, short-term memories, and frames. As a  demonstration of these abstractions, I have implemented a simulator for ``creatures'' controlled by a  network of abstract units. The creatures exist in a simple 2D world, and exhibit behaviors such as  catching mobile prey and sorting colored blocks into matching boxes. This program demonstrates that  it is possible to build systems that can interact effectively with a dynamic physical environment, yet use  symbolic representations to control aspects of their behavior.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-2004-004</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Society of Mind</field><field name="subject">Multi-Agent Systems</field><field name="identifier">AITR-2004-004</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Note on the Generalization Performance of Kernel Classifiers with Margin</field><field name="creator">Evgeniou, Theodoros</field><field name="description">We present distribution independent bounds on the generalization misclassification performance of a family of kernel classifiers with margin.

Two face recognition methods focusing on the aspect of pose invariance are presented and evaluated - the whole face approach and the component-based approach. The main challenge of this project is to develop a system that is able to identify faces under different viewing angles in realtime. The development of such a system will enhance the capability and robustness of current face recognition technology.  The whole-face approach recognizes faces by classifying a single feature vector consisting of the gray values of the whole face image. The component-based approach  first locates the facial components and extracts them. These components are normalized and combined into a single feature vector for classification. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used as the classifier for both approaches. Extensive tests with respect to the robustness against pose changes are performed on a  database that includes faces rotated up to about 40 degrees in depth. The component-based approach clearly outperforms the whole-face approach on all tests. Although this approach isproven to be more reliable, it is still too slow for real-time applications. That is the reason why a real-time face recognition system using the whole-face approach is implemented to recognize people in color video sequences.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-010</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-010</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-197</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning-Based Approach to Real Time Tracking and Analysis of Faces</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Vinay P.</field><field name="description">This paper describes a trainable system  capable of tracking faces and facialsfeatures  like eyes and nostrils and estimating basic  mouth features such as sdegrees of  openness and smile in real time.

This  means that segmentation of an image into  regions occurs without classification of  features within a region or comparison of  features between regions. This segmentation  framework is simpler than previous  computational approaches, making it  implementable by V1 mechanisms, though  higher leve l visual mechanisms are needed  to refine its output. However, it easily handles  a class of segmentation problems that are  tricky in conventional methods. The cortex  computes global region boundaries by  detecting the breakdown of homogeneity or  translation invariance in the input, using local  intra-cortical interactions mediated by the  horizontal connections. The difference  between contextual influences near and far  from region boundaries makes neural  activities near region boundaries higher than  elsewhere, making boundaries more salient  for perceptual pop-out. This proposal is  implemented in a biologically based model of  V1, and demonstrated using examples of  texture segmentation and figure-ground  segregation. The model performs  segmentation in exactly the same neural  circuit that solves the dual problem of the  enhancement of contours, as is suggested by  experimental observations. Its behavior is  compared with psychophysical and  physiological data on segmentation, contour  enhancement, and contextual influences. We  discuss the implications of segmentation  without classification and the predictions of  our V1 model, and relate it to other  phenomena such as asymmetry in visual  search.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1640</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">visual segmentation</field><field name="subject">pre-attentive segmentation</field><field name="subject">primary visual cortex</field><field name="subject">contextual influences</field><field name="subject">texture segmentation</field><field name="subject">contour enhancement</field><field name="subject">visual pop-out</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1640</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-163</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triangulation by Continuous Embedding</field><field name="creator">Meila, Marina</field><field name="description">When triangulating a belief network we aim to  obtain a junction tree of minimum state  space.

Given three such images it  can generate "virtual'' ones as the object  would look from any position near the ones  that the two input images were taken from.  The extrapolation from the example images  can be up to about 60 degrees of rotation. The  system is based on the trilinear constraints  that bind any three view so fan object. As a  side result, we propose two new methods for  camera calibration. We developed and used  one of them. We implemented the system  and tested it on real images of objects and  faces.

One prominent  proposal in this regard has expounded the  use of object centered models, such as  representations of the objects' 3D structures  in a coordinate frame independent of the  viewing parameters [Marr and Nishihara,  1978]. In contrast to this is another proposal  which suggests that the viewing parameters  encountered during the learning phase might  be inextricably linked to subsequent  performance on a recognition task [Tarr and  Pinker, 1989; Poggio and Edelman, 1990].  The 'object model', according to this idea, is  simply a collection of the sample views  encountered during training. Given that object  centered recognition strategies have the  attractive feature of leading to viewpoint  independence, they have garnered much of  the research effort in the field of computational  vision. Furthermore, since human recognition  performance seems remarkably robust in the  face of imaging variations [Ellis et al., 1989], it  has often been implicitly assumed that the  visual system employs an object centered  strategy. In the present study we examine this  assumption more closely. Our experimental  results with a class of novel 3D structures  strongly suggest the use of a view-based  strategy by the human visual system even  when it has the opportunity of constructing  and using object-centered models. In fact, for  our chosen class of objects, the results seem  to support a stronger claim: 3D object  recognition is 2D view-based.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1518</field><field name="subject">3D object recognition</field><field name="subject">object representations</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1518</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-106</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Convergence Properties of the EM Algorithm for Gaussian Mixtures</field><field name="creator">Jordan, Michael</field><field name="description">"Expectation-Maximization'' (EM) algorithm and  gradient-based approaches for maximum  likelihood learning of finite Gaussian  mixtures.

In particular, using  arguments from optimal recovery (Micchelli  and Rivlin, 1976), we develop an adaptive  sampling strategy (equivalent to adaptive  approximation) for arbitrary approximation  schemes. We provide a general formulation of  the problem and show how it can be  regarded as sequential optimal recovery. We  demonstrate the application of this general  formulation to two special cases of functions  on the real line 1) monotonically increasing  functions and 2) functions with bounded  derivative. An extensive investigation of the  sample complexity of approximating these  functions is conducted yielding both  theoretical and empirical results on test  functions. Our theoretical results (stated  insPAC-style), along with the simulations  demonstrate the superiority of our active  scheme over both passive learning as well as  classical optimal recovery.

Recent  reports of functionally and anatomically  segregated parallel streams in the primate  visual cortex seem to support this hypothesis  (Ungerlieder and Mishkin, 1982; VanEssen  and Maunsell, 1983; Shipp and Zeki, 1985;  Zeki and Shipp, 1988; De Yoe et al., 1994).  Here we present perceptual evidence that is  at odds with this view and instead suggests  strong symmetric interactions between the  form and motion processes. In one direction,  we show that the introduction of specific static  figural elements, say 'F', in a simple motion  sequence biases an observer to perceive a  particular motion field, say 'M'.

Correspondingly, modeling studies have often employed a 'grandmother'-type representation where the objects to be recognized were represented by individual units. However, objects in the natural world are commonly members of a class containing a number of visually similar objects, such as faces, for which physiology studies have provided support for a representation based on a sparse population code, which permits generalization from the learned exemplars to novel objects of that class. In this paper, we present results from psychophysical and modeling studies intended to investigate object recognition in natural ('continuous') object classes. In two experiments, subjects were trained to perform subordinate level discrimination in a continuous object class - images of computer-rendered cars - created using a 3D morphing system. By comparing the recognition performance of trained and untrained subjects we could estimate the effects of viewpoint-specific training and infer properties of the object class-specific representation learned as a result of training. We then compared the experimental findings to simulations, building on our recently presented HMAX model of object recognition in cortex, to investigate the computational properties of a population-based object class representation as outlined above. We find experimental evidence, supported by modeling results, that training builds a viewpoint- and class-specific representation that supplements a pre-existing repre-sentation with lower shape discriminability but possibly greater viewpoint invariance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1682</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1682</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-185</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Face Detection in Still Gray Images</field><field name="creator">Heisele, Bernd</field><field name="description">We present a trainable system for detecting frontal and near-frontal views of faces in still gray images using Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

This article provides an alternative application of the pricing mechanism to marketing research - using pseudo-securities markets to measure preferences over new product concepts. Surveys, focus groups, concept tests and conjoint studies are methods traditionally used to measure individual and aggregate preferences. Unfortunately, these methods can be biased, costly and time-consuming to conduct. The present research is motivated by the desire to efficiently measure preferences and more accurately predict new product success, based on the efficiency and incentive-compatibility of security trading markets.

Two norms used commonly for this purpose are L1 and L2, which are specific instances of the Minkowski metric. However, there is often not a principled reason for selecting one norm over the other. One way to address this problem is by examining whether one metric better captures the perceptual notion of image similarity than the other. With this goal, we examined perceptual preferences for images retrieved on the basis of the L1 versus the L2 norm.

Scene views are encoded using a holistic representation that provides low-resolution spatial and spectral information. The holistic nature of the representation dispenses with the need to rely on specific objects or local landmarks and also renders it robust against variations in object configurations. We demonstrate the scheme on the problem of recognizing scenes in video sequences captured while walking through an office environment. We develop a method for distinguishing between 'diagnostic' and 'generic' views and also evaluate changes in system performances as a function of the amount of training data available and the complexity of the representation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-015</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Scene classification</field><field name="subject">Navigation</field><field name="subject">scene representation</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-015</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-202</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Low-level Mechanisms in Brightness Perception</field><field name="creator">Sinha, Pawan</field><field name="description">Brightness judgments are a key part of the primate brain's visual analysis of the environment. There is general consensus that the perceived brightness of an image region is based not only on its actual luminance, but also on the photometric structure of its neighborhood. However, it is unclear precisely how a region's context influences its perceived brightness. Recent research has suggested that brightness estimation may be based on a sophisticated analysis of scene layout in terms of transparency, illumination and shadows. This work has called into question the role of low-level mechanisms, such as lateral inhibition, as explanations for brightness phenomena. Here we describe experiments with displays for which low-level and high-level analyses make qualitatively different predictions, and with which we can quantitatively assess the trade-offs between low-level and high-level factors. We find that brightness percepts in these displays are governed by low-level stimulus properties, even when these percepts are inconsistent with higher-level interpretations of scene layout. These results point to the important role of low-level mechanisms in determining brightness percepts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-017</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">brightness perception</field><field name="subject">perceptual organization</field><field name="subject">local mechanisms</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-017</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-203</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiclass Classification of SRBCTs</field><field name="creator">Yeo, Gene</field><field name="description">A novel approach to multiclass tumor classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) was introduced in a recent paper cite{Khan2001}.

A number of recent studies, however, have cast doubt on the completeness of translation invariance. In a new series of experiments we tried to investigate whether positional specificity of short-term memory is a general property of visual perception. We tested same/different discrimination of computer graphics models that were displayed at the same or at different locations of the visual field, and found complete translation invariance, regardless of the similarity of the animals and irrespective of direction and size of the displacement (Exp. 1 and 2). Decisions were strongly biased towards same decisions if stimuli appeared at a constant location, while after translation subjects displayed a tendency towards different decisions. Even if the spatial order of animal limbs was randomized ("scrambled animals"), no deteriorating effect of shifts in the field of view could be detected (Exp. 3). However, if the influence of single features was reduced (Exp. 4 and 5) small but significant effects of translation could be obtained. Under conditions that do not reveal an influence of translation, rotation in depth strongly interferes with recognition (Exp. 6). Changes of stimulus size did not reduce performance (Exp. 7). Tolerance to these object transformations seems to rely on different brain mechanisms, with translation and scale invariance being achieved in principle, while rotation invariance is not.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1610</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1610</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-150</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating Dependency Structure as a Hidden Variable</field><field name="creator">Meila, Marina</field><field name="description">This paper introduces a probability model, the  mixture of trees that can account for sparse,  dynamically changing dependence  relationships.

This surface, which in some feature space of possibly infinite dimension can be regarded as a hyperplane, is obtained from the solution of a problem of quadratic programming that depends on a regularization parameter. In this paper we study some mathematical properties of support vectors and show that the decision surface can be written as the sum of two orthogonal terms, the first depending only on the margin vectors (which are SVs lying on the margin), the second proportional to the regularization parameter. For almost all values of the parameter, this enables us to predict how the decision surface varies for small parameter changes. In the special but important case of feature space of finite dimension m, we also show that there are at most m+1 margin vectors and observe that m+1 SVs are usually sufficient to fully determine the decision surface. For relatively small m this latter result leads to a consistent reduction of the SV number.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1612</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1612</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-152</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual Segmentation without Classification in a Model of the Primary Visual Cortex</field><field name="creator">Li, Zhaoping</field><field name="description">Stimuli outside classical receptive fields  significantly influence the neurons' activities in  primary visual cortex.

Here we lay the foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive ananalytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal (although the beliefs will be incorrect). We show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we prove that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revisionat convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states.

The LLC situation is only linearly degenerate, and we show that one can obtain a unique solution when the admissibility constraints of the tensor are accounted for. The line configuration described by an LLC, rather than being some obscure case, is in fact quite typical. It includes, as a particular example, the case of a camera moving down a hallway in an office environment or down an urban street. Furthermore, an LLC situation may occur as an artifact such as in direct estimation from spatio-temporal derivatives of image brightness.

In this contribution we develop a statistical framework for analyzing co-occurrence data in a general setting where elementary observations are joint occurrences of pairs of abstract objects from two finite sets. The main challenge for statistical models in this context is to overcome the inherent data sparseness and to estimate the probabilities for pairs which were rarely observed or even unobserved in a given sample set. Moreover, it is often of considerable interest to extract grouping structure or to find a hierarchical data organization. A novel family of mixture models is proposed which explain the observed data by a finite number of shared aspects or clusters. This provides a common framework for statistical inference and structure discovery and also includes several recently proposed models as special cases. Adopting the maximum likelihood principle, EM algorithms are derived to fit the model parameters. We develop improved versions of EM which largely avoid overfitting problems and overcome the inherent locality of EM--based optimization. Among the broad variety of possible applications, e.g., in information retrieval, natural language processing, data mining, and computer vision, we have chosen document retrieval, the statistical analysis of noun/adjective co-occurrence and the unsupervised segmentation of textured images to test and evaluate the proposed algorithms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1625</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1625</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-159</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Invariances in Inferotemporal Cell Tuning</field><field name="creator">Riesenhuber, Maximilian</field><field name="description">In macaque inferotemporal cortex (IT), neurons have been found to respond selectively to complex shapes while showing broad tuning ("invariance") with respect to stimulus transformations such as translation and scale changes and a limited tuning to rotation in depth. Training monkeys with novel, paperclip-like objects, Logothetis et al. could investigate whether these invariance properties are due to experience with exhaustively many transformed instances of an object or if there are mechanisms that allow the cells to show response invariance also to previously unseen instances of that object. They found object-selective cells in anterior IT which exhibited limited invariance to various transformations after training with single object views. While previous models accounted for the tuning of the cells for rotations in depth and for their selectivity to a specific object relative to a population of distractor objects, the model described here attempts to explain in a biologically plausible way the additional properties of translation and size invariance. Using the same stimuli as in the experiment, we find that model IT neurons exhibit invariance properties which closely parallel those of real neurons. Simulations show that the model is capable of unsupervised learning of view-tuned neurons. The model also allows to make experimentally testable predictions regarding novel stimulus transformations and combinations of stimuli.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1629</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1629</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-160</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Notes on PCA, Regularization, Sparsity and Support Vector Machines</field><field name="creator">Poggio, Tomaso</field><field name="description">We derive a new representation for a function as a linear combination of local correlation kernels at optimal sparse locations and discuss its relation to PCA, regularization, sparsity principles and Support Vector Machines.

We apply them to show 1) that a standard regularization functional with a stabilizer defined in terms of the correlation function induces a regression function in the span of the feature space of classical Principal Components and 2) that there exist a dual representations of the regression function in terms of a regularization network with a kernel equal to a generalized correlation function. We then describe the main observation of the paper: the dual representation in terms of the correlation function can be sparsified using the Support Vector Machines (Vapnik, 1982) technique and this operation is equivalent to sparsify a large dictionary of basis functions adapted to the task, using a variation of Basis Pursuit De-Noising (Chen, Donoho and Saunders, 1995; see also related work by Donahue and Geiger, 1994; Olshausen and Field, 1995; Lewicki and Sejnowski, 1998).

This paper also presents results of experiments in which we use a dictionary of multiscale basis functions and then use Basis Pursuit De-Noising to obtain a sparse, multiscale approximation of a signal. The results are analyzed and we conclude that 1) when used with a sparse representation technique, the correlation function is an effective kernel for image reconstruction and superresolution, 2) for image compression, PCA and SVM have different tradeoffs, depending on the particular metric that is used to evaluate the results, 3) in sparse representation techniques, L_1 is not a good proxy for the true measure of sparsity, L_0, and 4) the L_epsilon norm may be a better error metric for image reconstruction and compression than the L_2 norm, though the exact psychophysical metric should take into account high order structure in images.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1635</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1635</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-162</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimating Dependency Structure as a Hidden Variable</field><field name="creator">Meila, Marina</field><field name="description">This paper introduces a probability model, the mixture of trees that can account for sparse, dynamically changing dependence relationships.

A direct consequence of this result is that SVMC can be seen as a special case of SVMR.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1649</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1649</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-166</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Noise Model of Support Vector Machine Regression</field><field name="creator">Pontil, Massimiliano</field><field name="description">Support Vector Machines Regression (SVMR)  is a regression technique which has been  recently introduced by V. Vapnik and his  collaborators (Vapnik, 1995; Vapnik, Golowich  and Smola, 1996). In SVMR the goodness of  fit is measured not by the usual quadratic loss  function (the mean square error), but by a  different loss function called Vapnik"s  $epsilon$- insensitive loss function, which is  similar to the "robust" loss functions  introduced by Huber (Huber, 1981). The  quadratic loss function is well justified under  the assumption of Gaussian additive noise.  However, the noise model underlying the  choice of Vapnik's loss function is less clear.  In this paper the use of Vapnik's loss function is shown to be  equivalent to a model of additive and  Gaussian noise, where the variance and  mean of the Gaussian are random variables.  The probability distributions for the variance  and mean will be stated explicitly. While this  work is presented in the framework of SVMR,  it can be extended to justify non-quadratic loss  functions in any Maximum Likelihood or  Maximum A Posteriori approach. It applies not  only to Vapnik's loss function, but to a much  broader class of loss functions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1651</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1651</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-168</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multivariate Density Estimation: An SVM Approach</field><field name="creator">Mukherjee, Sayan</field><field name="description">We formulate density estimation as an inverse operator problem.

The visemes are acquired from a recorded visual corpus of a human subject which is specifically designed to elicit one instantiation of each viseme. Using optical flow methods, correspondence from every viseme to every other viseme is computed automatically. By morphing along this correspondence, a smooth transition between viseme images may be generated. A complete visual utterance is constructed by concatenating viseme transitions. Finally, phoneme and timing information extracted from a text-to-speech synthesizer is exploited to determine which viseme transitions to use, and the rate at which the morphing process should occur. In this manner, we are able to synchronize the visual speech stream with the audio speech stream, and hence give the impression of a photorealistic talking face.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1658</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1658</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-173</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning-Based Approach to Estimation of Morphable Model Parameters</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Vinay</field><field name="description">We describe the key role played by partial  evaluation in the Supercomputing Toolkit, a  parallel computing system for scientific  applications that effectively exploits the vast  amount of parallelism exposed by partial  evaluation.

Here we report experimental results suggesting that color cues do play a role in face recognition and their contribution becomes evident when shape cues are degraded. Under such conditions, recognition performance with color images is significantly better than that with grayscale images.

The interpretation of shading, edges and junctions may provide a 3D model of the scene but it will not inform about the actual "size" of the space. One possible source of information for absolute depth estimation is the image size of known objects. However, this is computationally complex due to the difficulty of the object recognition process. Here we propose a source of information for absolute depth estimation that does not rely on specific objects: we introduce a procedure for absolute depth estimation based on the recognition of the whole scene. The shape of the space of the scene and the structures present in the scene are strongly related to the scale of observation. We demonstrate that, by recognizing the properties of the structures present in the image, we can infer the scale of the scene, and therefore its absolute mean depth. We illustrate the interest in computing the mean depth of the scene with application to scene recognition and object detection.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2001-036</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">depth</field><field name="subject">monocular</field><field name="subject">scale selection</field><field name="subject">natural images</field><field name="subject">scene recognition</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2001-036</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-213</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bagging Regularizes</field><field name="creator">Poggio, Tomaso</field><field name="description">Intuitively, we expect that averaging --- or  bagging --- different regressors with low correlation should  smooth their behavior and be somewhat similar to regularization.

(2001) recently studied the  nature of object representation in monkey  inferotemporal cortex using a combination of  optical imaging and extracellular recordings.  In particular, they examined IT neuron  responses to complex natural objects and  "simplified" versions thereof. In that study, in  42% of the cases, optical imaging revealed a  decrease in the number of activation patches  in IT as stimuli were "simplified". However, in  58% of the cases, "simplification" of the  stimuli actually led to the appearance of  additional activation patches in IT. Based on  these results, the authors propose a scheme  in which an object is represented by  combinations of active and inactive columns  coding for individual features.  We examine the patterns of activation caused  by the same stimuli as used by Tsunoda et al.  in our model of object recognition in cortex  (Riesenhuber 99). We find that object-tuned  units can show a pattern of appearance and  disappearance of features identical to the  experiment. Thus, the data of Tsunoda et al.  appear to be in quantitative agreement with a  simple object-based representation in which  an object's identity is coded by its similarities  to reference objects.

Notable in this regard are the  relative contributions of the internal (eyes, nose and  mouth) and external (hair and jaw-line) features. Past  studies that have investigated this issue have typically  used high-resolution images or good-quality line  drawings as facial stimuli. The results obtained are  therefore most relevant for understanding the  identification of faces at close range. However, given  that real-world viewing conditions are rarely optimal, it  is also important to know how image degradations,  such as loss of resolution caused by large viewing  distances, influence our ability to use internal and  external features. Here, we report experiments  designed to address this issue. Our data characterize  how the relative contributions of internal and external  features change as a function of image resolution.  While we replicated results of previous studies that  have shown internal features of familiar faces to be  more useful for recognition than external features at  high resolution, we found that the two feature sets  reverse in importance as resolution decreases. These  results suggest that the visual system uses a highly  non-linear cue-fusion strategy in combining internal  and external features along the dimension of image  resolution and that the configural cues that relate the  two feature sets play an important role in judgments of  facial identity.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2003-004</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Face recognition</field><field name="subject">features</field><field name="subject">low resolution</field><field name="subject">degraded images</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2003-004</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-225</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptual Evaluation of Video-Realistic Speech</field><field name="creator">Geiger, Gadi</field><field name="description">abstract  With many visual speech animation techniques now  available, there is a clear need for systematic  perceptual evaluation schemes. We describe here our  scheme and its application to a new video-realistic  (potentially indistinguishable from real recorded video)  visual-speech animation system, called Mary 101.  Two types of experiments were performed: a)  distinguishing visually between real and synthetic  image- sequences of the same utterances, ("Turing  tests") and b) gauging visual speech recognition by  comparing lip-reading performance of the real and  synthetic image-sequences of the same utterances  ("Intelligibility tests").  Subjects that were presented randomly with either real  or synthetic image-sequences could not tell the  synthetic from the real sequences above chance level.  The same subjects when asked to lip-read the  utterances from the same image-sequences  recognized speech from real image-sequences  significantly better than from synthetic ones. However,  performance for both, real and synthetic, were at levels  suggested in the literature on lip-reading. We conclude  from the two experiments that the animation of Mary  101 is adequate for providing a percept of a talking  head. However, additional effort is required to improve  the animation for lip-reading purposes like  rehabilitation and language learning.  In addition, these two tasks could be considered as  explicit and implicit perceptual discrimination tasks. In  the explicit task (a), each stimulus is classified directly  as a synthetic or real image-sequence by detecting a  possible difference between the synthetic and the real  image-sequences. The implicit perceptual  discrimination task (b) consists of a comparison  between visual recognition of speech of real and  synthetic image-sequences. Our results suggest that  implicit perceptual discrimination is a more sensitive  method for discrimination between synthetic and real  image-sequences than explicit perceptual  discrimination.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2003-003</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">visual speech</field><field name="subject">speech animation</field><field name="subject">face animation</field><field name="subject">image morphing</field><field name="subject">lip reading</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2003-003</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-224</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissociated Dipoles: Image representation via non-local comparisons</field><field name="creator">Balas, Benjamin J.</field><field name="description">A fundamental question in visual neuroscience is how to represent image structure. The most common representational schemes rely on differential operators that compare adjacent image regions. While well-suited to encoding local relationships, such operators have significant drawbacks. Specifically, each filter's span is confounded with the size of its sub-fields, making it difficult to compare small regions across large distances. We find that such long-distance comparisons are more tolerant to common image transformations than purely local ones, suggesting they may provide a useful vocabulary for image encoding. . We introduce the "Dissociated Dipole," or "Sticks" operator, for encoding non-local image relationships. This operator de-couples filter span from sub-field size, enabling parametric movement between edge and region-based representation modes. We report on the perceptual plausibility of the operator, and the computational advantages of non-local encoding.

While tuning properties of the cells in early part of the ventral visual stream, thought to be responsible for object recognition in the primate, are comparatively well understood, several different theories have been proposed regarding tuning in higher visual areas, such as V4. We used the model of object recognition in cortex presented by Riesenhuber and Poggio (1999), where more complex shape tuning in higher layers is the result of combining afferent inputs tuned to simpler features, and compared the tuning properties of model units in intermediate layers to those of V4 neurons from the literature. In particular, we investigated the issue of shape representation in visual area V1 and V4 using oriented bars and various types of gratings (polar, hyperbolic, and Cartesian), as used in several physiology experiments. Our computational model was able to reproduce several physiological findings, such as the broadening distribution of the orientation bandwidths and the emergence of a bias toward non-Cartesian stimuli. Interestingly, the simulation results suggest that some V4 neurons receive input from afferents with spatially separated receptive fields, leading to experimentally testable predictions. However, the simulations also show that the stimulus set of Cartesian and non-Cartesian gratings is not sufficiently complex to probe shape tuning in higher areas, necessitating the use of more complex stimulus sets.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2003-021</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Shape Tuning</field><field name="subject">Shape Representation</field><field name="subject">Features</field><field name="subject">HMAX</field><field name="subject">Visual Cortex</field><field name="subject">Gratings</field><field name="subject">V4</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2003-021</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-231</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Component based recognition of objects in an office environment</field><field name="creator">Morgenstern, Christian</field><field name="description">We present a component-based approach for recognizing objects under large pose changes.

At the neural level, attention increases firing rates of neurons in visual cortex whose preferred stimulus is currently attended to. However, it is not yet known how these two phenomena are linked, i.e., how the visual system could be "tuned" in a task-dependent fashion to improve task performance. To answer this question, we performed simulations with the HMAX model of object recognition in cortex [45]. We modulated firing rates of model neurons in accordance with experimental  results about effects of feature-based attention on single neurons and measured changes in the model's performance in a variety of object recognition tasks. It turned out that recognition performance could only be improved under very limited circumstances and that attentional influences on the process of object  recognition per se tend to display a lack of specificity or raise false alarm rates. These observations lead us to postulate a new role for the observed attention-related neural response modulations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-004</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">object recognition</field><field name="subject">attention</field><field name="subject">vision</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-004</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-235</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk Bounds for Mixture Density Estimation</field><field name="creator">Rakhlin, Alexander</field><field name="description">In this paper we focus on the problem of estimating a bounded density using a finite combination of densities from a given class.

A fundamental problem in the analysis of gene expression data is the identification of highly relevant genes that either discriminate between phenotypic labels or are important with respect to the cellular process studied in the experiment: for example cell cycle or heat shock in yeast experiments, chemical or genetic perturbations of mammalian cell lines, and genes involved in class discovery for human tumors. In this paper we focus on the task of unsupervised gene selection. The problem of selecting a small subset of genes is particularly challenging as the datasets involved are typically characterized by a very small sample size ?? the order of few tens of tissue samples ??d by a very large feature space as the number of genes tend to be in the high thousands. We propose a model independent approach which scores candidate gene selections using spectral properties of the candidate affinity matrix. The algorithm is very straightforward to implement yet contains a number of remarkable properties which guarantee consistent sparse selections. To illustrate the value of our approach we applied our algorithm on five different datasets. The first consists of time course data from four well studied Hematopoietic cell lines (HL-60, Jurkat, NB4, and U937). The other four datasets include three well studied treatment outcomes (large cell lymphoma, childhood medulloblastomas, breast tumors) and one unpublished dataset (lymph status). We compared our approach both with other unsupervised methods (SOM,PCA,GS) and with supervised methods (SNR,RMB,RFE). The results clearly show that our approach considerably outperforms all the other unsupervised approaches in our study, is competitive with supervised methods and in some case even outperforms supervised approaches.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-002</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-002</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-234</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Face processing in humans is compatible with a simple shape-based model of vision</field><field name="creator">Riesenhuber</field><field name="description">Understanding how the human visual system recognizes objects is one of the key challenges in neuroscience. Inspired by a large body of physiological evidence (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Livingstone and Hubel, 1988; Tso et al., 2001; Zeki, 1993), a general class of recognition models has emerged which is based on a hierarchical organization of visual processing, with succeeding stages being sensitive to image features of increasing complexity (Hummel and Biederman, 1992; Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999; Selfridge, 1959). However, these models appear to be incompatible with some well-known psychophysical results. Prominent among these are experiments investigating recognition impairments caused by vertical inversion of images, especially those of faces. It has been reported that faces that differ "featurally" are much easier to distinguish when inverted than those that differ "configurally" (Freire et al., 2000; Le Grand et al., 2001; Mondloch et al., 2002) ??finding that is difficult to reconcile with the aforementioned models. Here we show that after controlling for subjects' expectations, there is no difference between "featurally" and "configurally" transformed faces in terms of inversion effect. This result reinforces the plausibility of simple hierarchical models of object representation and recognition in cortex.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-006</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">object recognition</field><field name="subject">faces</field><field name="subject">psychophysics</field><field name="subject">inversion effect</field><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">comput</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-006</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-236</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of sets of oriented and non-oriented receptive fields as local descriptors</field><field name="creator">Yokono, Jerry Jun</field><field name="description">Local descriptors are increasingly used for the task of object recognition because of their perceived robustness with respect to occlusions and to global geometrical deformations. We propose a performance criterion for a local descriptor based on the tradeoff between selectivity and invariance. In this paper, we evaluate several local descriptors with respect to selectivity and invariance. The descriptors that we evaluated are Gaussian derivatives up to the third order, gray image patches, and Laplacian-based descriptors with either three scales or one scale filters. We compare selectivity and invariance to several affine changes such as rotation, scale, brightness, and viewpoint. Comparisons have been made keeping the dimensionality of the descriptors roughly constant. The overall results indicate a good performance by the descriptor based on a set of oriented Gaussian filters. It is interesting that oriented receptive fields similar to the Gaussian derivatives as well as receptive fields similar to the Laplacian are found in primate visual cortex.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-007</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">local descriptor</field><field name="subject">steerable filter</field><field name="subject">Gaussian derivatives</field><field name="subject">selectivity</field><field name="subject">invariance</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-007</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-237</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rotation Invariant Object Recognition from One Training Example</field><field name="creator">Yokono, Jerry Jun</field><field name="description">Local descriptors are increasingly used for the task of object recognition because of their perceived robustness with respect to occlusions and to global geometrical deformations.

But if we look at life cycle costs, then we  must conclude that the important question is how to make a system easy to operate. To do this we  need to make it easy for the operators to see what's going on and to then manipulate the system so  that it does what it is supposed to. This is a radically different criterion for success.  What makes a computer system visible and controllable? This is a difficult question, but it's clear that  today's modern operating systems with nearly 50 million source lines of code are neither. Strikingly,  the MIT Lisp Machine and its commercial successors provided almost the same functionality as today's  mainstream sytsems, but with only 1 Million lines of code. This paper is a retrospective examination of  the features of the Lisp Machine hardware and software system. Our key claim is that by building the  Object Abstraction into the lowest tiers of the system, great synergy and clarity were obtained. It is our hope that this is a lesson that can impact tomorrow's designs. We also speculate on how the  spirit of the Lisp Machine could be extended to include a comprehensive access control model and how  new layers of abstraction could further enrich this model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-2004-005</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">Software Environments</field><field name="subject">Computer Archicture</field><field name="identifier">AIM-2004-005</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Nonparametric Approach to Pricing and Hedging Derivative Securities via Learning Networks</field><field name="creator">Hutchinson, James M.</field><field name="description">We propose a nonparametric method for  estimating derivative financial asset pricing  formulae using learning networks.

This new learning algorithm can be  seen as an alternative training technique for  Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. An interesting  property of this approach is that it is an  approximate implementation of the Structural  Risk Minimization (SRM) induction principle.  The derivation of Support Vector Machines, its  relationship with SRM, and its geometrical  insight, are discussed in this paper. Training  a SVM is equivalent to solve a quadratic  programming problem with linear and box  constraints in a number of variables equal to  the number of data points. When the number  of data points exceeds few thousands the  problem is very challenging, because the  quadratic form is completely dense, so the  memory needed to store the problem grows  with the square of the number of data points.  Therefore, training problems arising in some  real applications with large data sets are  impossible to load into memory, and cannot  be solved using standard non-linear  constrained optimization algorithms. We  present a decomposition algorithm that can  be used to train SVM's over large data sets.  The main idea behind the decomposition is  the iterative solution of sub-problems and the  evaluation of, and also establish the stopping  criteria for the algorithm. We present previous  approaches, as well as results and important  details of our implementation of the algorithm  using a second-order variant of the Reduced  Gradient Method as the solver of the sub-problems. As an application of SVM's, we  present preliminary results we obtained  applying SVM to the problem of detecting  frontal human faces in real images.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1602</field><field name="subject">AI</field><field name="subject">MIT</field><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Patter recognition</field><field name="subject">Support Vector Machine</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Detection</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1602</field><field name="identifier">CBCL-144</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Note on Support Vector Machines Degeneracy</field><field name="creator">Rifkin, Ryan</field><field name="description">When training Support Vector Machines  (SVMs) over non-separable data sets, one  sets the threshold $b$ using any dual cost  coefficient that is strictly between the bounds  of $0$ and $C$.

We also derive  necessary and sufficient conditions on the  input data for this to occur.

The framework that is  described here for people is easily applied to  other objects as well. The motivation for  developing a component based approach is  two fold: first, to enhance the performance of  person detection systems on frontal and rear  views of people and second, to develop a  framework that directly addresses the  problem of detecting people who are partially  occluded or whose body parts blend in with  the background. The data classification is  handled by several support vector machine  classifiers arranged in two layers. This  architecture is known as Adaptive  Combination of Classifiers (ACC). The  system performs very well and is capable of  detecting people even when all components  of a person are not found. The performance of  the system is significantly better than a full  body person detector designed along similar  lines. This suggests that the improved  performance is due to the components based  approach and the ACC data classification  structure.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field

The apparent avoidance of the "curse of dimensionality" is due to the fact that these function spaces are more and more constrained as the dimension increases. Examples include spaces of the Sobolev tpe, in which the number of weak derivatives is required to be larger than the number of dimensions. We give results both for approximation in the L2 norm and in the Lc norm. The interesting feature of these results is that, thanks to the constructive nature of Jones" and Barron"s lemma, an iterative procedure is defined that can achieve this rate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AIM-1288</field><field name="identifier">AIM-1288</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Assessment of the Degree of Implementation of the Lean Aerospace Initiative Principles and Practices within the US Aerospace and Defense Industry</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Thomas E.</field><field name="description">This report is a formal documentation of the results of an assessment of the degree to which Lean Principles and Practices have been implemented in the US Aerospace and Defense Industry.

Once it was established that &#8220;lean principles&#8221; (the term coined to describe the new paradigm in automobile manufacturing) were indeed applicable to aircraft manufacturing as well, the Initiative was broadened to include other segments of the defense aerospace industry. These consisted of electronics/avionics, engines, electro-mechanical systems, missiles, and space systems manufacturers.

Specifically, it provides details about research on program instability. Its objective is to discuss high-level findings detailing: 1) the relative contribution of different factors to a program&#8217;s overall instability; 2) the cost impact of program instability on acquisition programs; and 3) some strategies recommended by program managers for overcoming and/or mitigating the negative effects of program instability on their programs. Because this report comes as this research is underway, this is not meant to be a definitive document on the subject. Rather, is it anticipated that this research may potentially produce a number of reports on program instability-related topics. The government managers of military acquisition programs rated annual budget or production rate changes, changes in requirements, and technical difficulties as the three top contributors, respectively, to program instability. When asked to partition actual variance in their program&#8217;s planned cost and schedule to each of these factors, it was found that the combined effects of unplanned budget and requirement changes accounted for 5.2% annual cost growth and 20% total program schedule slip. At a rate of approximately 5% annual cost growth from these factors, it is easy to see that even conservative estimates of the cost benefits to be gained from acquisition reforms and process improvements can quickly be eclipsed by the added cost associated with program instability. Program management practices involving the integration of stakeholders from throughout the value chain into the decision making process were rated the most effective at avoiding program instability. The use of advanced information technologies was rated the most effective at mitigating the negative impact of program instability.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value Stream Analysis and Mapping for Product Development</field><field name="creator">McManus, Hugh</field><field name="description">This paper explores the concept of Value Stream Analysis and Mapping (VSA/M) as applied to Product Development (PD) efforts. Value Stream Analysis and Mapping is a method of business process improvement. The application of VSA/M began in the manufacturing community. PD efforts provide a different setting for the use of VSA/M. Site visits were made to nine major U.S. aerospace organizations. Interviews, discussions, and participatory events were used to gather data on (1) the sophistication of the tools used in PD process improvement efforts, (2) the lean context of the use of the tools, and (3) success of the efforts. It was found that all three factors were strongly correlated, suggesting success depends on both good tools and lean context. Finally, a general VSA/M method for PD activities is proposed. The method uses modified process mapping tools to analyze and improve process.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation Workshop: High Performance Work Organizations</field><field name="creator">Klein, Jan</field><field name="description">Since the rise of the industrial revolution, there are few challenges that compare in scale and scope with the challenge of implementing lean principles in order to achieve high performance work systems.

Since accurate  modeling is important for any controller,  issues of estimating the dynamic model of a  manipulator and its load were addressed first.  Practical and effective algorithms were  developed fro the Newton-Euler equations to  estimate the inertial parameters of  manipulator rigid-body loads and links. Load  estimation was implemented both on PUMA  600 robot and on the MIT Serial Link Direct  Drive Arm. With the link estimation algorithm,  the inertial parameters of the direct drive arm  were obtained. For both load and link  estimation results, the estimated parameters  are good models of the actual system for  control purposes since torques and forces  can be predicted accurately from these  estimated parameters.  The estimated model of the direct drive arm  was them used to evaluate trajectory following  performance by feedforward and computed  torque control algorithms. The experimental  evaluations showed that the dynamic  compensation can greatly improve trajectory  following accuracy.  Various stability issues of force control were  studied next. It was determined that there are  two types of instability in force control.  Dynamic instability, present in all of the  previous force control algorithms discussed  in this thesis, is caused by the interaction of a  manipulator with a stiff environment.  Kinematics instability is present only in the  hybrid control algorithm of Raibert and Craig,  and is caused by the interaction of the inertia  matrix with the Jacobian inverse coordinate  transformation in the feedback path. Several  methods were suggested and demonstrated  experimentally to solve these stability  problems. The result of the stability analyses  were then incorporated in implementing a  stable force/position controller on the direct  drive arm by the modified resolved  acceleration method using both joint torque  and wrist force sensor feedbacks.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">AITR-912</field><field name="identifier">AITR-912</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Transport Sector: The Role of Existing Fuel Taxes in Climate Policy</field><field name="creator">Paltsev, Sergey.</field><field name="description">Existing fuel taxes play a major role in determining the welfare effects of exempting the transportation sector from measures to control greenhouse gases. To study this phenomenon we modify the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to disaggregate the household transportation sector. This improvement requires an extension of the GTAP data set that underlies the model. The revised and extended facility is then used to compare economic costs of cap-and-trade systems differentiated by sector, focusing on two regions: the USA where the fuel taxes are low, and Europe where the fuel taxes are high. We find that the interplay between carbon policies and pre-existing taxes leads to different results in these regions: in the USA exemption of transport from such a system would increase the welfare cost of achieving a national emissions target, while in Europe such exemptions will correct pre-existing distortions and reduce the cost.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">;Report no. 117</field><field name="identifier">http://mit.edu/globalchange/www/abstracts.html#a117</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7348</field><field name="identifier">Report no. 117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon Nanotube Growth Using Ni Catalyst in Different Layouts</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, H.

The formation of the ZnO nanorods and the growth parameters are controlled by reactant concentration, temperature and pH. No catalyst is required. The XRD studies show that the ZnO nanorods are single crystals and that they grow along the c axis of the crystal plane. The room temperature photoluminescence measurements have shown ultraviolet peaks at 388nm with high intensity, which are comparable to those found in high quality ZnO films. The mechanism of the nanorod growth in the aqueous solution is proposed. The dependence of the ZnO nanorods on the growth parameters was also investigated. While changing the growth temperature from 60&#176;C to 150&#176;C, the morphology of the ZnO nanorods changed from sharp tip (needle shape) to flat tip (rod shape).

In addition, unlike other III-V compound semiconductors, the ratio of gallium to indium incorporated in InGaN is in general not a simple function of the metal atomic flux ratio, f[subscript Ga]/f[subscript In]. Instead, In incorporation is complicated by the tendency of gallium to incorporate preferentially and excess In to form metallic droplets on the growth surface. This phenomenon can definitely affect the In distribution in the InGaN system. Scanning electron microscopy, room temperature photoluminescence, and X-ray diffraction techniques have been used to characterize InGaN layer grown on InN and InGaN buffers.

However, due to the depletion of poly-Si gate, it is difficult to reduce the gate thickness further especially for sub-65 nm CMOS generation. Fully silicidation metal gate (FUSI) is one of the most promising solutions. Furthermore, FUSI metal gate reduces gate-line sheet resistance, prevents boron penetration to channels, and has good process compatibility with high-k gate dielectric. Poly-SiGe gate technology is another solution because of its enhancement of boron activation and compatibility with the conventional CMOS process. Combination of these two technologies for the formation of fully germanosilicided metal gate makes the approach very attractive.

The method uses a relaxed SiGe buffer as a template for inducing tensile strain in a Si layer, which is then bonded to another Si handle wafer.  The original Si wafer and the relaxed SiGe buffer are subsequently removed, thereby transferring a strained-Si layer directly to Si substrate without intermediate SiGe or oxide layers. Complete removal of Ge from the structure was confirmed by cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy as well as secondary ion mass spectrometry. A plan-view transmission electron microscopy study of the strained-Si/Si interface reveals that the lattice-mismatch between the layers is accommodated by an orthogonal array of edge dislocations. This misfit dislocation array, which forms upon bonding, is geometrically necessary and has an average spacing of approximately 40nm, in excellent agreement with established dislocation theory.

The forces are related to the jumps in pressure and the jumps in the derivatives of both pressure and velocity, and are interpolated using cubic splines.

This includes the ability to work on binary code in the absence of sources and to perform optimization across module boundaries. However, it has a significant disadvantage viz-a-viz traditional static optimization: it has a significant runtime overhead. There can be performance gain only if the overhead can be amortized. In this paper, we will quantitatively analyze the runtime overhead introduced by a dynamic optimizer, DynamoRIO. We found that the major overhead does not come from the optimizer's operation. Instead, it comes from the extra code in the code cache added by DynamoRIO. After a detailed analysis, we will propose a method of trace construction that ameliorate the overhead introduced by the dynamic optimizer, thereby reducing the runtime overhead of DynamoRIO. We believe that the result of the study as well as the proposed solution is applicable to other scenarios such as dynamic code translation and managed execution that utilizes a framework similar to that of dynamic optimization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Computer Science (CS);</field><field name="subject">Dynamic optimization</field><field name="subject">DynamoRIO</field><field name="subject">overhead</field><field name="subject">indirect jump</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context Interchange as a Scalable Solution to Interoperating Amongst Heterogeneous Dynamic Services</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Hongwei</field><field name="description">Many online services access a large number of autonomous data sources and at the same time need to meet different user requirements. It is essential for these services to achieve semantic interoperability among these information exchange entities. In the presence of an increasing number of proprietary business processes, heterogeneous data standards, and diverse user requirements, it is critical that the services are implemented using adaptable, extensible, and scalable technology. The COntext INterchange (COIN) approach, inspired by similar goals of the Semantic Web, provides a robust solution. In this paper, we describe how COIN can be used to implement dynamic online services where semantic differences are reconciled on the fly. We show that COIN is flexible and scalable by comparing it with several conventional approaches. With a given ontology, the number of conversions in COIN is quadratic to the semantic aspect that has the largest number of distinctions. These semantic aspects are modeled as modifiers in a conceptual ontology; in most cases the number of conversions is linear with the number of modifiers, which is significantly smaller than traditional hard-wiring middleware approach where the number of conversion programs is quadratic to the number of sources and data receivers. In the example scenario in the paper, the COIN approach needs only 5 conversions to be defined while traditional approaches require 20,000 to 100 million. COIN achieves this scalability by automatically composing all the comprehensive conversions from a small number of declaratively defined sub-conversions.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Computer Science (CS);</field><field name="subject">Data integration</field><field name="subject">heterogeneous sources</field><field name="subject">ontology</field><field name="subject">scalability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Context Mediation in the Semantic Web: Handling OWL Ontology and Data Disparity through Context Interchange</field><field name="creator">Tan, Philip Eik Yeow</field><field name="description">The COntext INterchange (COIN) strategy is an approach to solving the problem of interoperability of semantically heterogeneous data sources through context mediation.

To reduce the distance computation, we first propose a structure (BID) using BIt-Difference to answer approximate KNN query. The BID employs one bit to represent each feature vector of point and the number of bit-difference is used to prune the further points. To facilitate real dataset which is typically skewed, we enhance the BID mechanism with clustering, cluster adapted bitcoder and dimensional weight, named the BID&#8314;.

Furthermore, specifications and safety assertions are often modified in an incremental fashion, where problematic bugs are fixed one at a time.

In this project, we propose an analytical cache model that succinctly captures the miss performance of an application over the entire cache parameter space. Unlike exhaustive trace driven simulation, our model requires that the program be simulated once so that a few key characteristics can be obtained. Using these application-dependent characteristics, the model can span the entire cache parameter space consisting of cache sizes, associativity and cache block sizes. In our unified model, we are able to cater for direct-mapped, set and fully associative instruction, data and unified caches. Validation against full trace-driven simulations shows that our model has a high degree of fidelity. Finally, we show how the model can be coupled with a power model for caches such that one can very quickly decide on pareto-optimal performance-power design points for rapid design space exploration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Computer Science (CS);</field><field name="subject">Cache</field><field name="subject">Analytical model</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Power</field><field name="subject">Simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keyword Join: Realizing Keyword Search in P2P-based Database Systems</field><field name="creator">Yu, Bei</field><field name="description">In this paper, we present a P2P-based database sharing system that provides information sharing capabilities through keyword-based search techniques.

In this paper, we investigate the suitability of utilizing text and image data from the Web for co-training. We perform measurements to find indications of conditional independence in the texts and images obtained from the Web. Our measurements suggest that conditional independence is likely to be present in the data.

In this paper, we propose an AR approach for assembly guidance using a virtual interactive tool that is intuitive and easy to use. The virtual interactive tool, termed the Virtual Interaction Panel (VirIP), involves two tasks: the design of the VirIPs and the real-time tracking of an interaction pen using a Restricted Coulomb Energy (RCE) neural network. The VirIP includes virtual buttons, which have meaningful assembly information that can be activated by an interaction pen during the assembly process. A visual assembly tree structure (VATS) is used for information management and assembly instructions retrieval in this AR environment. VATS is a hierarchical tree structure that can be easily maintained via a visual interface. This paper describes a typical scenario for assembly guidance using VirIP and VATS. The main characteristic of the proposed AR system is the intuitive way in which an assembly operator can easily step through a pre-defined assembly plan/sequence without the need of any sensor schemes or markers attached on the assembly components.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology (IMST);</field><field name="subject">Augmented reality</field><field name="subject">assembly guidance</field><field name="subject">assembly tree</field><field name="subject">real-time tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Benefits of Re-Evaluating Real-Time Fulfillment Decisions</field><field name="creator">Xu, Ping Josephine</field><field name="description">At the time of a customer order, the e-tailer assigns the order to one or more of its order fulfillment centers, and/or to drop shippers, so as to minimize procurement and transportation costs, based on the available current information. However this assignment is necessarily myopic as it cannot account for all future events, such as subsequent customer orders or inventory replenishments. We examine the potential benefits from periodically re-evaluating these real-time order-assignment decisions.  We construct near-optimal heuristics for the re-assignment for a large set of customer orders with the objective to minimize the total number of shipments. We investigate how best to implement these heuristics for a rolling horizon, and discuss the effect of demand correlation, customer order size, and the number of customer orders on the nature of the heuristics.

In such a policy, the period inventory is managed based on the classical (s,S) policy and price is determined based on the inventory position at the beginning of each period. For more general demand functions, i.e., multiplicative plus additive functions, we demonstrate that the profit-to-go function is not necessarily k-concave and an (s,S,p) policy is not necessarily optimal.

The TPM is a discrete-time model in which all transitions occur at the start of each time period. The time period must be defined appropriately in order for the model to be meaningful. Each period must be short enough so that a job is unlikely to travel through more than one station in one period. At the same time, the time period needs to be long enough to justify the assumptions of continuous workflow and Markovian job movements. We build an extension to the TPM that overcomes this restriction of period sizing by permitting production control over shorter time intervals. We achieve this by deriving a continuous-time linear control rule for a single station.

An experimental setup was designed and built for doing experiments on this micro-fabrication process. An ultraviolet (UV) excimer laser at the wavelength of 248 nm was used as the light source and a single piece of photo-mask carrying a series of two dimensional (2D) patterns sliced from a three dimensional (3D) micro-part was employed for the photolithography process. The experiments were conducted on the solidification of liquid photopolymer from single layer to multiple layers. The single-layer photolithography experiments showed that certain photopolymers could be applied for the 3D micro-fabrication, and solid layers with sharp shapes could be formed from the liquid polymer identified. By using a unique alignment technique, multiple layers of photolithography was successfully realized for a micro-gear with features at 60 microns.

The machines operate according to a static priority rule, operating on the highest priority part whenever possible, and operating on lower priority parts only when unable to produce those with higher priorities. We develop a new decomposition method to analyze the behavior of the manufacturing system by decomposing the long production line into small analytically tractable components. As a first step in modeling a production line with more than one part type, we restrict ourselves to the case where there are two part types. Detailed modeling and derivations are presented with a small two-part-type production line that consists of two processing machines and two demand machines.

The flow is generated through the application of an external electric field that acts on the free charges that exists in a thin Debye layer at the channel walls. The charge on the wall is due to the chemistry of the solid-fluid interface, and it can vary along the channel, e.g. due to modification of the wall. This investigation focuses on the simulation of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) profile in a cylindrical microchannel with step change in zeta potential. The modified Navier-Stoke equation governing the velocity field and a non-linear two-dimensional Poisson-Boltzmann equation governing the electrical double-layer (EDL) field distribution are solved numerically using finite control-volume method. Continuities of flow rate and electric current are enforced resulting in a non-uniform electrical field and pressure gradient distribution along the channel. The resulting parabolic velocity distribution at the junction of the step change in zeta potential, which is more typical of a pressure-driven velocity flow profile, is obtained.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology (IMST);</field><field name="subject">Electroosmotic flow</field><field name="subject">Electrical double-layer</field><field name="subject">Pressure-driven flow</field><field name="subject">Zeta potential</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Methodology for Synchronized Scheduling of Parallel Station Assembly with Air Transportation</field><field name="creator">Ganesan, Viswanath Kumar</field><field name="description">We present an optimal methodology for synchronized scheduling of production assembly with air transportation to achieve accurate delivery with minimized cost in consumer electronics supply chain (CESC). This problem was motivated by a major PC manufacturer in consumer electronics industry, where it is required to schedule the delivery requirements to meet the customer needs in different parts of South East Asia. The overall problem is decomposed into two sub-problems which consist of an air transportation allocation problem and an assembly scheduling problem. The air transportation allocation problem is formulated as a Linear Programming Problem with earliness tardiness penalties for job orders. For the assembly scheduling problem, it is basically required to sequence the job orders on the assembly stations to minimize their waiting times before they are shipped by flights to their destinations. Hence the second sub-problem is modelled as a scheduling problem with earliness penalties. The earliness penalties are assumed to be independent of the job orders.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology (IMST);</field><field name="subject">Scheduling</field><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">Optimization</field><field name="subject">air transportation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7458</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimizing the Dynamic Distribution of Data-stream for High Speed Communications</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Z.W.</field><field name="description">The performances of high-speed network communications frequently rest with the distribution of data-stream.

Existing MEMS design models or systems follow a process-driven design paradigm, that is, design starts from the specification of process sequence or the customization of foundry-ready process template. There has been essentially no methodology or model that supports generic, high-level design synthesis for MEMS conceptual design. As a result, there lacks a basis for specifying the initial process sequences. To address this problem, this paper proposes a performance-driven, microfabrication-oriented methodology for MEMS conceptual design. A unified behaviour representation method is proposed which incorporates information of both physical interactions and chemical/biological/other reactions. Based on this method, a behavioural process based design synthesis model is proposed, which exploits multidisciplinary phenomena for design solutions, including both the structural components and their configuration for the MEMS device, as well as the necessary substances for the chemical/biological/other reactions. The model supports both forward and backward synthetic search for suitable phenomena. To ensure manufacturability, a strategy of using microfabrication-oriented phenomena as design knowledge is proposed, where the phenomena are developed from existing MEMS devices that have associated MEMS-specific microfabrication processes or foundry-ready process templates. To test the applicability of the proposed methodology, the paper also studies microfluidic device design and uses a micro-pump design for the case study.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology (IMST);</field><field name="subject">MEMS</field><field name="subject">Behaviour</field><field name="subject">conceptual design</field><field name="subject">microfluidic device</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning and Scheduling Decisions in Supply Chains with Multiple Supply Modes: An Integrated Approach</field><field name="creator">Bhatnagar, Rohit</field><field name="description">We address the problem of jointly determining shipment planning and scheduling decisions with the presence of multiple shipment modes.

Micro-embossing is a deformation process where the workpiece material is heated to permit easier material flow and then forced over a planar patterned tool. While there has been considerable, attention paid to process feasibility very little effort has been put into production issues such as process capability and eventual process control. In this paper, we present initial studies aimed at identifying the origins and magnitude of variability for embossing features at the micron scale in PMMA. Test parts with features ranging from 3.5- 630 &#181;m wide and 0.9 &#181;m deep were formed. Measurements at this scale proved very difficult, and only atomic force microscopy was able to provide resolution sufficient to identify process variations. It was found that standard deviations of widths at the 3-4 &#181;m scale were on the order of 0.5 &#181;m leading to a coefficient of variation as high as 13%. Clearly, the transition from test to manufacturing for this process will require understanding the causes of this variation and devising control methods to minimize its magnitude over all types of parts.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology (IMST);</field><field name="subject">Microembossing</field><field name="subject">PMMA</field><field name="subject">Variability</field><field name="subject">Process Control</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Review of bio-particle manipulation using dielectrophoresis</field><field name="creator">Kua, C.

Microfluidic devices hold the promise of combining a small analytical laboratory onto a chip-sized substrate to identify, immobilize, separate, and purify cells, bio-molecules, toxins, and other chemical and biological materials. Compared to conventional instruments, microfluidic devices would perform these tasks faster with higher sensitivity and efficiency, and greater affordability. Dielectrophoresis is one of the enabling technologies for these devices. It exploits the differences in particle dielectric properties to allow manipulation and characterization of particles suspended in a fluidic medium. Particles can be trapped or moved between regions of high or low electric fields due to the polarization effects in non-uniform electric fields. By varying the applied electric field frequency, the magnitude and direction of the dielectrophoretic force on the particle can be controlled.

The customer types are characterized by their arrival process, with a price-dependant arrival rate, and the random time they remain in the system. Many real-life situations could fit in this framework, for example an Internet provider or a call center, but originally this problem was thought for a company that sells phone-cards and needs to set the price-per-minute for each destination.

In a model featuring time-sensitive bidders with uniform valuations and Poisson arrivals but endogenous bidding times, we focus on finding temporary and permanent buyout prices maximizing the seller's discounted revenue, and examine the relative benefit of using each type of option in various environments. We characterize equilibrium bidder strategies in both cases and then solve the problem of maximizing seller's utility by simulation. Our numerical experiments suggest that buyout options may significantly increase a seller&#8217;s revenue.

Deep reactive ion etch is commonly used in MEMS fabrication where high-aspect ratio features are to be produced in silicon. It is typical for many supposedly identical devices, perhaps of diameter 10 mm, to be etched simultaneously into one silicon wafer of diameter 150 mm. Etch non-uniformity depends on uneven distributions of ion and neutral species at the wafer level, and on local consumption of those species at the device, or die, level. An ion&#8211;neutral synergism model is constructed from data obtained from etching several layouts of differing pattern opening densities. Such a model is used to predict wafer-level variation with an r.m.s. error below 3%. This model is combined with a die-level model, which we have reported previously, on a MEMS layout. The two-level model is shown to enable prediction of both within-die and wafer-scale etch rate variation for arbitrary wafer loadings.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Innovation in Manufacturing Systems and Technology (IMST);</field><field name="subject">DRIE</field><field name="subject">pattern dependencies</field><field name="subject">CAD</field><field name="subject">modeling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UV Embossed Plastic Chip for Protein Separation and Identification</field><field name="creator">Guo, Xun</field><field name="description">This report demonstrates a UV-embossed polymeric chip for protein separation and identification by Capillary Isoelectric Focusing (CIEF) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desportion/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS).

The gap between a rotating inner cylinder and a stationary outer cylinder is filled with a Newtonian mineral oil. Beyond a critical rotation speed (&#969;[subscript c]), Taylor vortices appear in this system. Small air bubbles are introduced into the gap through a needle connected to a syringe pump.  These are then captured in the cores of the vortices (core bubble) and in the outflow regions along the inner cylinder (wall bubble). The flow field is measured with a two-dimensional particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) system. The motion of the bubbles is monitored by using a high speed video camera. It has been found that, if the core bubbles are all of the same size, a bubble ring forms at the center of the vortex such that bubbles are azimuthally uniformly distributed. There is a saturation number (N[subscript s]) of bubbles in the ring, such that the addition of one more bubble leads eventually to a coalescence and a subsequent complicated evolution. Ns increases with increasing rotation speed and decreasing bubble size. For bubbles of non-uniform size, small bubbles and large bubbles in nearly the same orbit can be observed to cross due to their different circulating speeds. The wall bubbles, however, do not become uniformly distributed, but instead form short bubble-chains which might eventually evolve into large bubbles.  The motion of droplets and particles in a Taylor vortex was also investigated. As with bubbles, droplets and particles align into a ring structure at low rotation speeds, but the saturation number is much smaller. Moreover, at high rotation speeds, droplets and particles exhibit a characteristic periodic oscillation in the axial, radial and tangential directions due to their inertia.  In addition, experiments with non-spherical particles show that they behave rather similarly.  This study provides a better understanding of particulate behavior in vortex flow structures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">bubble</field><field name="subject">particle</field><field name="subject">droplet</field><field name="subject">Taylor vortex</field><field name="subject">Ns</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Core-Shell Assisted Bimetallic Assembly of Pt and Ru Nanoparticles by DNA Hybridization</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jim Yang</field><field name="description">We have discovered that the current protocols to assemble Au nanoparticles based on DNA hybridization do not work well with the small metal nanoparticles (e.g. 5 nm Au, 3.6 nm Pt and 3.2 nm Ru particles). Further investigations revealed the presence of strong interaction between the oligonucleotide backbone and the surface of the small metal nanoparticles. The oligonucleotides in this case are recumbent on the particle surface and are therefore not optimally oriented for hybridization. The nonspecific adsorption of oligonucleotides on small metal nanoparticles must be overcome before DNA hybridization can be accepted as a general assembly method. Two methods have been suggested as possible solutions to this problem. One is based on the use of stabilizer molecules which compete with the oligonucleotides for adsorption on the metal nanoparticle surface. Unfortunately, the reported success of this approach in small Au nanoparticles (using K&#8322;BSPP) and Au films (using 6-mercapto-1-hexanol) could not be extended to the assembly of Pt and Ru nanoparticles by DNA hybridization. The second approach is to simply use larger metal particles. Indeed most reports on the DNA hybridization induced assembly of Au nanoparticles have made use of relatively large particles (&gt;10 nm), hinting at a weaker non-specific interaction between the oligonucleotides and large Au nanoparticles. However, most current methods of nanoparticle synthesis are optimized to produce metal nanoparticles only within a narrow size range. We find that core-shell nanoparticles formed by the seeded growth method may be used to artificially enlarge the size of the metal particles to reduce the nonspecific binding of oligonucleotides. We demonstrate herein a core-shell assisted growth method to assemble Pt and Ru nanoparticles by DNA hybridization. This method involves firstly synthesizing approximately 16 nm core-shell Ag-Pt and 21 nm core-shell Au-Ru nanoparticles from 9.6 nm Ag seeds and 17.2 nm Au seeds respectively by the seed-mediated growth method. The core-shell nanoparticles were then functionalized by complementary thiolated oligonucleotides followed by aging in 0.2 M PBS buffer for 6 hours. The DNA hybridization induced bimetallic assembly of Pt and Ru nanoparticles could then be carried out in 0.3 M PBS buffer for 10 hours.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">small metal nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">DNA hybridization</field><field name="subject">K2BSPP</field><field name="subject">core-shell assisted growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential effects of insulin signaling on individual carbon fluxes for fatty acid synthesis in brown adipocytes</field><field name="creator">Yoo, Hyuntae</field><field name="description">Considering the major role of insulin signaling on fatty acid synthesis via stimulation of lipogenic enzymes, differential effects of insulin signaling on individual carbon fluxes for fatty acid synthesis have been investigated by comparing the individual lipogenic fluxes in WT and IRS-1 knockout (IRS-1 KO) brown adipocytes.  Results from experiments on WT and IRS-1 KO cells incubated with [5-&#185;&#179;C] glutamine were consistent with the existence of reductive carboxylation pathway.  Analysis of isotopomer distribution of nine metabolites related to the lipogenic routes from glucose and glutamine in IRS-1 KO cells using [U-&#185;&#179;C] glutamine as compared to that in WT cells indicated that flux through reductive carboxylation pathway was diminished while flux through conventional TCA cycle was stimulated due to absence of insulin signaling in IRS-1 KO cells.  This observation was confirmed by quantitative estimation of individual lipogenic fluxes in IRS-1 KO cells and their comparison with fluxes in WT cells.

This process may be extended to the encapsulation of drugs in these micro and nanoparticles for controlled release purposes. Conventional supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process involves spraying a solution (organic solvent + dissolved polymer) into supercritical fluid (CO[subscript 2]), which acts as an antisolvent. The high rate of mass transfer between organic solvent and supercritical CO[subscript 2] results in supersaturation of the polymer in the spray droplet and precipitation of the polymer as micro or nanoparticles occurs. In the SASEM method, ultrasonic vibration is used to atomize the solution entering the high pressure with supercritical CO[subscript 2]. At the same time, the ultrasonic vibration generated turbulence in the high pressure vessel, leading to better mass transfer between the organic solvent and the supercritical CO&#8322;.

In short, the EHDA process produces solution droplets in a controlled manner, and as the solvent evaporates from the surface of the droplets, polymeric particles are formed. By varying the voltage applied, the size of the droplets can be changed, and consequently, the size of the particles can also be controlled. By using both a nozzle electrode and a ring electrode placed axisymmetrically and slightly above the nozzle electrode, we are able to produce a Single Taylor Cone Single Jet for a wide range of voltages, contrary to just using a single nozzle electrode where the range of permissible voltage for the creation of the Single Taylor Cone Single Jet is usually very small. Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA) test results have shown that the droplet size increases with increasing voltage applied. This trend is predicted by the electrohydrodynamic theory of the Single Taylor Cone Single Jet based on a perfect dielectric fluid model. Particles fabricated using different voltages do not show much change in the particles size, and this may be attributed to the solvent evaporation process. Nevertheless, these preliminary results do show that this method has the potential of providing us with a way of fine controlling the particles size using relatively simple method with trends predictable by existing theories.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">Electrohydrodynamic Atomization</field><field name="subject">Polymeric Particles</field><field name="subject">Single Taylor Cone Single Jet</field><field name="subject">Size Control</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Granular Attrition due to Rotary Valve in a Pneumatic Conveying System</field><field name="creator">Yao, Jun</field><field name="description">The rotary valve is a widely used mechanical device in many solids-handling industrial processes. However, it may also be responsible for most of the attrition effects occurring in a typical process. In this study, the attrition effects occurring in a rotary valve operating as a stand-alone device and as part of a pneumatic conveying system were investigated. In the former case granular attrition was carried out at three different rotary valve speeds and the experimental results obtained were found to be in good agreement with the Gwyn correlation. In the latter case three typical air flow rates were used in the pneumatic conveying system. The size distribution of the attrition product obtained at the lowest air flow rate used was not adequately described by the Gwyn correlation. The attrition process and mechanisms involved were analysed and the minimum size of the attrition product obtained from both modes of operations was found to be similar.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">rotary valve</field><field name="subject">attrition</field><field name="subject">granular material</field><field name="subject">pneumatic conveying</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inverse Metabolic Engineering of Synechocystis PCC 6803 for Improved Growth Rate and Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate Production</field><field name="creator">Tyo, Keith E.</field><field name="description">Synechocystis PCC 6803 is a photosynthetic bacterium that has the potential to make bioproducts from carbon dioxide and light.  Biochemical production from photosynthetic organisms is attractive because it replaces the typical bioprocessing steps of crop growth, milling, and fermentation, with a one-step photosynthetic process.  However, low yields and slow growth rates limit the economic potential of such endeavors. Rational metabolic engineering methods are hindered by limited cellular knowledge and inadequate models of Synechocystis. Instead, inverse metabolic engineering, a scheme based on combinatorial gene searches which does not require detailed cellular models, but can exploit sequence data and existing molecular biological techniques, was used to find genes that (1) improve the production of the biopolymer poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and (2) increase the growth rate. A fluorescence activated cell sorting assay was developed to screen for high PHB producing clones. Separately, serial sub-culturing was used to select clones that improve growth rate. Novel gene knock-outs were identified that increase PHB production and others that increase the specific growth rate. These improvements make this system more attractive for industrial use and demonstrate the power of inverse metabolic engineering to identify novel phenotype-associated genes in poorly understood systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">photosynthetic bacteria</field><field name="subject">one-step bioprocessing</field><field name="subject">inverse metabolic engineering</field><field name="subject">combinatorial gene searching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MicroRNAs Modulate Hematopoietic Lineage Differentiation</field><field name="creator">Lodish, Harvey F.</field><field name="description">MicroRNAs (miRNAs), an abundant class of ~22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs, are thought to play an important regulatory role in animal and plant development at the posttranscriptional level. Many miRNAs cloned from mouse bone marrow cells are differentially regulated in various hematopoietic lineages, suggesting that they might influence hematopoietic lineage differentiation.  Some human miRNAs are linked to leukemias: the miR-15a/miR-16 locus is frequently deleted or down-regulated in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and miR-142 is at a translocation site found in a case of aggressive B-cell leukemia.  miR-181, a miRNA upregulated only in the B cell lineage of mouse bone marrow cells, promotes B cell differentiation and inhibits production of CD8&#8314; T cells when expressed in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. In contrast miR-142s inhibits production of both CD4&#8314; and CD8&#8314; T cells and does not affect B cells. Collectively, these results indicate that microRNAs are components of the molecular circuitry controlling mouse hematopoiesis and suggest that other microRNAs have similar regulatory roles during other facets of vertebrate development.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">microRNA</field><field name="subject">B cells</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">leukemia</field><field name="subject">lymphoma</field><field name="subject">stem cells</field><field name="subject">CD4+</field><field name="subject">CD8+</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Multi-scale Model for Copper Dishing in Chemical-Mechanical Polishing</field><field name="creator">Noh, Kyungyoon</field><field name="description">The present success in the manufacture of multi-layer interconnects in ultra-large-scale integration is largely due to the acceptable planarization capabilities of the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In the past decade, copper has emerged as the preferred interconnect material. The greatest challenge in Cu CMP at present is the control of wafer surface non-uniformity at various scales. As the size of a wafer has increased to 300 mm, the wafer-level non-uniformity has assumed critical importance. Moreover, the pattern geometry in each die has become quite complex due to a wide range of feature sizes and multi-level structures. Therefore, it is important to develop a non-uniformity model that integrates wafer-, die- and feature-level variations into a unified, multi-scale dielectric erosion and Cu dishing model. In this paper, a systematic way of characterizing and modeling dishing in the single-step Cu CMP process is presented. The possible causes of dishing at each scale are identified in terms of several geometric and process parameters. The feature-scale pressure calculation based on the step-height at each polishing stage is introduced. The dishing model is based on pad elastic deformation and the evolving pattern geometry, and is integrated with the wafer- and die-level variations. Experimental and analytical means of determining the model parameters are outlined and the model is validated by polishing experiments on patterned wafers. Finally, practical approaches for minimizing Cu dishing are suggested.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">Chemical mechanical polishing</field><field name="subject">Cu dishing</field><field name="subject">Semiconductor manufacturing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New Class of Nonionic Photosensitive Surfactants: Some Insights Concerning Conformations</field><field name="creator">Smith, Kenneth A.</field><field name="description">We report on a new class of nonionic, photosensitive surfactants consisting of a polar di(ethylene oxide) head group attached to an alkyl spacer of between two and eight methylene groups, coupled through an ether linkage to an azobenzene moiety.  Structural changes associated with the interconversion of the azobenzene group between its cis and trans forms as mediated by the wavelength of an irradiating light source cause changes in the surface tension and self-assembly properties. Differences in saturated surface tensions (surface tension at concentrations above the CMC) were as high as 14.4 mN/m under radiation of different wavelengths.  The qualitative behavior of the surfactants changed as the spacer length changed, attributed to the different orientations adopted by the different surfactants depending on their isomerization states, as revealed by neutron reflection studies. The self-assembly of these photosensitive surfactants has been investigated by light scattering, small angle neutron scattering, and cryo-TEM under different illuminations. The significant change in the self-assembly in response to different illumination conditions was attributed to the sign change in Gaussian rigidity, which originated from the azobenzene photoisomerization.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">azobenzene</field><field name="subject">photosensitive surfactants</field><field name="subject">surface tension</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Over Expression of the CMP-sialic Acid Transporter in Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells Leads to Increased Sialylation</field><field name="creator">Wong, Niki S.C.</field><field name="description">Most glyco-engineering approaches used to improve quality of recombinant glycoproteins involve the manipulation of glycosyltransferase and/or glycosidase expression. We investigated whether the over expression of nucleotide sugar transporters, particularly the CMP-sialic acid transporter (CMP-SAT), would be a means to improve the sialylation process in CHO cells. We hypothesized that increasing the expression of the CMP-SAT in the cells would increase the transport of the CMP-sialic acid in the Golgi lumen, hence increasing the intra-lumenal CMP-sialic acid pool, and resulting in a possible increase in sialylation extent of proteins being produced. We report the construction of a CMP-SAT expression vector which was used for transfection into CHO-IFN&#947;, a CHO cell line producing human IFN&#947;. This resulted in approximately 2 to 5 times increase in total CMP-SAT expression in some of the positive clones as compared to untransfected CHO-IFN&#947;, as determined using real-time PCR analysis. This in turn concurred with a 9.6% to 16.3% percent increase in site sialylation. This engineering approach has thus been identified as a novel means of improving sialylation in recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics. This strategy can be utilized feasibly on its own, or in combination with existing sialylation improvement strategies. It is believed that such multi-prong approaches are required to effectively manipulate the complex sialylation process, so as to bring us closer to the goal of producing recombinant glycoproteins of high and consistent sialylation from mammalian cells.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells</field><field name="subject">Over expression</field><field name="subject">Protein Quality</field><field name="subject">Sialylation</field><field name="subject">Transport</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prion Protein is Expressed on Long-term Repopulating Hematopoietic Stem Cells and is Necessary for their Self-renewal</field><field name="creator">Lodish, Harvey F.</field><field name="description">We show that the prion protein (PrP) is expressed on the surface of bone marrow cell populations enriched in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.

A vector, named pRGFP8, was constructed. The plasmid pRGFP8 contains a reporter gene, gfp2 and two extraneous DNA fragments. The gene gfp2 makes it possible to screen the high expression regions on the chromosome. The extraneous DNA fragments can help to create the unique loci on the chromosome and increase the gene targeting frequency by increasing the homology. After transfection into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells, the linearized pRGFP8 can integrate into the chromosome of the host cells and form the unique sites. With FACS, 90 millions transfected cells were sorted and the cells with strongest GFP expression were isolated, and then 8 stable high expression GFP CHO cell lines were selected as candidates for the new host cell. Taking the unique site created by pRGFP8 on the chromosome in the new host cells as a targeting locus, the gfp2 gene was replaced with the gene of interest, human ifngamma, by transfecting the targeting plasmid pRIH-IFN. Then using FACS, the cells with the dimmest GFP fluorescence were selected. These cells showed they had strong abilities to produce the protein of interest, IFN-gamma. During the gene targeting experiment, we found there is positive correlation between the fluorescence density of the GFP CHO host cells and the specific production rate of IFN-gamma. This result shows that the strategy in our expression system is correct: the production of the interesting protein increases with the increase fluorescence of the GFP host cells. This system, the new host cell lines and the targeting vector, can be utilized for highly expressing the gene of interest. More importantly, by using FACS, we can fully screen all the transfected cells, which can reduce the chances of losing the best cells.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">Gene retargeting</field><field name="subject">GFP</field><field name="subject">high expression</field><field name="subject">mammalian cells</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stimuli-responsive Novel Amphiphilic Polymers for Chemical and Biomedical Applications</field><field name="creator">Tam, K.

Self assembly structures can exist in many different forms, such as spherical micelles, rod-like micelles, bi-layers, vesicles, bi-continuous structure etc.  Most biological systems are basically comprised of many of these organised structures arranged in an intelligent manner, which impart functions and life to the system.  We have adopted the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique to synthesize various types of block copolymer systems that self-assemble into different microstructure when subject to an external stimuli, such as pH or temperature. The systems that we have studied are: (1) pH responsive fullerene (C60) containing poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA-b-C60); (2) pH and temperature responsive fullerene containing poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (C&#8326;&#8320;-b-PDMAEMA); (3) other responsive water-soluble fullerene systems.  By varying temperature, pH and salt concentration, different types microstructure can be produced. In the presence of inorganic salts, fractal patterns at nano- to microscopic dimension were observed for negatively charged PMAA-b-C60, while such structure was not observed for positively charged PDMAEMA-b-C60. We demonstrated that negatively charged fullerene containing polymeric systems can serve as excellent nano-templates for the controlled growth of inorganic crystals at the nano- to micrometer length scale and the possible mechanism was proposed. The physical properties and the characteristics of their self-assembly properties will be discussed, and their implications to chemical and biomedical applications will be highlighted.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">Amphiphilic polymers</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">microstructures</field><field name="subject">atom transfer radical polymerization</field><field name="subject">ATRP</field><field name="subject">fullerene</field><field name="subject">poly(methacrilic acid)</field><field name="subject">poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate]</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subcutaneous study on the controlled release of Etanidazole and Taxol for the treatment of Glioma</field><field name="creator">Naraharisetti, Pavan Kumar</field><field name="description">BALB/c nude mice 6 weeks old were inoculated with glioma C6 cell-line and the efficacy of the different amount of Etanidazole-discs and Taxol-microspheres was investigated.

The 1% drug loading microspheres of each drug were produced by spray drying and the discs were obtained by compressing the Etanidazole-microspheres. Intra-tumoral injection followed by irradiation resulted in high systemic dosage and thus systemic toxicity.

A radiation dosage of 2 Gy each time for a number of times was given for animals implanted with Etanidazole and no irradiation was given for animals implanted with Taxol. Increasing the number of doses clearly decreased the rate of tumor growth. The increase in the amount of drug on smaller sized tumors controlled the tumor better and there was agglomeration of the microspheres resulting in deviation of release profile of the drug as compared to the in vitro studies.

The magnetite nanoparticles are prepared according to the method proposed by Sun et al. (2004), which leads to a monodisperse population of ~ 6 nm particles stabilized by oleic acid. The functionalization of the nanoparticles has been performed by transforming particles into macro-initiators for the ATRP, and to achieve this two different routes have been explored. The first one is the ligand-exchange method, which consists of replacing some oleic acid molecules adsorbed on the particle surface with molecules that act as an initiator for ATRP. The second method consists in using the addition reaction of bromine to the oleic acid double bond, which turns the oleic acid itself into an initiator for the ATRP. We have then grown polymer brushes of a variety of acrylic polymers on the particles, including polyisopropylacrylamide and polyacrylic acid. The nanoparticles so functionalized are water soluble and show responsive behavior: either temperature responsive behavior when polyisopropylacrylamide is grown from the surface or PH responsive in the case of polyacrylic acid.

It was observed that PAA&#8328;&#8320;-F&#8328;&#8327;-PAA&#8328;&#8320; forms stable complexes with weakly basic anti-cancer drug, Doxorubicin. Thermodynamic changes due to the drug binding to the copolymer were assessed at different pH by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The formation of the polymer/drug complexes was studied by turbidimetric titration and dynamic light scattering. Doxorubicin and PAA-b-F87-b-PAA block copolymer are found to interact strongly in aqueous solution via non-covalent interactions over a wide pH range. At pH&gt;4.35, drug binding is due to electrostatic interactions. Hydrogen-bond also plays a role in the stabilization of the PAA&#8328;&#8320;-F&#8328;&#8327;-PAA&#8328;&#8320;/DOX complex.

When CDOX &gt;0.13mM, as suggested by the light scattering result, the reorganization of the polymer/drug complex is believed to occur. With further addition of DOX (CDOX &gt;0.34mM), sharp increase in the turbidity indicates the formation of large aggregates, followed by phase separation.

Surface analysis suggested that the as-synthesized and subsequently heated iron-iron carbide particles were coated by iron oxide, which originated from oxidization of surface Fe atoms.  The heat-treated nanoparticles exhibited a magnetization of 160 emu/g, which is two times of that of currently used spinel iron oxide nanoparticles.

It is also shown that diffusive mass transfer becomes independent of the oscillating outer flow if the Strouhal number is greater than one.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">aerosol</field><field name="subject">convective-diffusive</field><field name="subject">lung</field><field name="subject">sub-micron</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tubular Organization of SnO&#8322; Nanocrystallites for Improved Lithium Ion Battery Anode Performance</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yong</field><field name="description">Porous tin oxide nanotubes were obtained by vacuum infiltration of tin oxide nanoparticles into porous aluminum oxide membranes, followed by calcination. The porous tin oxide nanotube arrays so prepared were characterized by FE-SEM, TEM, HRTEM, and XRD. The nanotubes are open-ended, highly ordered with uniform cross-sections, diameters and wall thickness. The tin oxide nanotubes were evaluated as a substitute anode material for the lithium ion batteries. The tin oxide nanotube anode could be charged and discharged repeatedly, retaining a specific capacity of 525 mAh/g after 80 cycles. This capacity is significantly higher than the theoretical capacity of commercial graphite anode (372 mAh/g) and the cyclability is outstanding for a tin based electrode. The cyclability and capacities of the tin oxide nanotubes were also higher than their building blocks of solid tin oxide nanoparticles. A few factors accounting for the good cycling performance and high capacity of tin oxide nanotubes are suggested.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">tin oxide</field><field name="subject">nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">vacuum infiltration</field><field name="subject">calcifination</field><field name="subject">nanotubes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variability in the Stability and Productivity of Transfected Genes in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells</field><field name="creator">Ng, Say Kong</field><field name="description">In the field of biologics production, productivity and stability of the transfected gene of interest are two very important attributes that dictate if a production process is viable. To further understand and improve these two traits, we would need to further our understanding of the factors affecting them. These would include integration site of the gene, gene copy number, cell phenotypic variation and cell environment. As these factors play different parts in the development process, they lead to variable productivity and stability of the transfected gene between clones, the well-known phenomenon of &#8220;clonal variation&#8221;. A study of this phenomenon and how the various factors contribute to it will thus shed light on strategies to improve productivity and stability in the production cell line. Of the four factors, the site of gene integration appears to be one of the most important. Hence, it is proposed that work is done on studying how different integration sites affect the productivity and stability of transfected genes in the development process. For the study to be more industrially relevant, it is proposed that the Chinese Hamster Ovary dhfr-deficient cell line, CHO-DG44, is used as the model system.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Molecular Engineering of Biological and Chemical Systems (MEBCS);</field><field name="subject">biologics production</field><field name="subject">transfected genes</field><field name="subject">clonal variation</field><field name="subject">Chinese hamster ovary cells</field><field name="subject">CHO</field><field name="subject">gene integration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Failure-Oblivious Computing and Boundless Memory Blocks</field><field name="creator">Rinard, Martin C.</field><field name="description">Memory errors are a common cause of incorrect software execution and security vulnerabilities. We have developed two new techniques that help software continue to execute successfully through memory errors: failure-oblivious computing and boundless memory blocks. The foundation of both techniques is a compiler that generates code that checks accesses via pointers to detect out of bounds accesses. Instead of terminating or throwing an exception, the generated code takes another action that keeps the program executing without memory corruption. Failure-oblivious code simply discards invalid writes and manufactures values to return for invalid reads, enabling the program to continue its normal execution path. Code that implements boundless memory blocks stores invalid writes away in a hash table to return as the values for corresponding out of bounds reads. he net effect is to (conceptually) give each allocated memory block unbounded size and to eliminate out of bounds accesses as a programming error. We have implemented both techniques and acquired several widely used open source servers (Apache, Sendmail, Pine, Mutt, and Midnight Commander).With standard compilers, all of these servers are vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks as documented at security tracking web sites. Both failure-oblivious computing and boundless memory blocks eliminate these security vulnerabilities (as well as other memory errors). Our results show that our compiler enables the servers to execute successfully through buffer overflow attacks to continue to correctly service user requests without security vulnerabilities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Computer Science (CS);</field><field name="subject">Memory Errors</field><field name="subject">Buffer Overflow Attacks</field><field name="subject">Failure-Oblivious Computing</field><field name="subject">Acceptability-Oriented Computing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Air Pollution Control on Climate</field><field name="creator">Prinn, Ronald G.</field><field name="description">Urban air pollution and climate are closely connected due to shared generating processes (e.g., combustion) for emissions of the driving gases and aerosols. They are also connected because the atmospheric lifecycles of common air pollutants such as CO, NOx and VOCs, and of the climatically important methane gas (CH4) and sulfate aerosols, both involve the fast photochemistry of the hydroxyl free radical (OH). Thus policies designed to address air pollution may impact climate and vice versa. We present calculations using a model coupling economics, atmospheric chemistry, climate and ecosystems to illustrate some effects of air pollution policy alone on global warming. We consider caps on emissions of NOx, CO, volatile organic carbon, and SOx both individually and combined in two ways. These caps can lower ozone causing less warming, lower sulfate aerosols yielding more warming, lower OH and thus increase CH4 giving more warming, and finally, allow more carbon uptake by ecosystems leading to less warming. Overall, these effects significantly offset each other suggesting that air pollution policy has a relatively small net effect on the global mean surface temperature and sea level rise. However, our study does not account for the effects of air pollution policies on overall demand for fossil fuels and on the choice of fuels (coal, oil, gas), nor have we considered the effects of caps on black carbon or organic carbon aerosols on climate. These effects, if included, could lead to more substantial impacts of capping pollutant emissions on global temperature and sea level than concluded here. Caps on aerosols in general could also yield impacts on other important aspects of climate beyond those addressed here, such as the regional patterns of cloudiness and precipitation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">;Report no. 118</field><field name="identifier">http://mit.edu/globalchange/www/abstracts.html#a118</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7510</field><field name="identifier">Report no. 118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lifecycle Value Framework for Tactical Aircraft Product Development</field><field name="creator">Hallander, Ingrid</field><field name="description">Due to a dramatic reduction in defense procurement, the benchmark for developing new defense systems today is performance at an affordable cost. In an attempt to encircle a more holistic perspective of value, lifecycle value has evolved as a concept within the Lean Aerospace Initiative, LAI. The implication of this is development of products incorporating lifecycle and long-term focus instead of a shortsighted cost cutting focus. The interest to reduce total cost of ownership while still improving performance, availability, and sustainability, other dimensions taken into account within the lifecycle value approach, falls well within this context. Several factors prevent enterprises from having a holistic perspective during product development. Some important aspects are increased complexity of the products and significant technological uncertainty. The combination of complexity in system design and the limits of individual human comprehension typically prevent a best value solution to be envisioned. The purpose of this research was to examine relative contributions in product development and determine factors that significantly promote abilities to consider and achieve lifecycle value. This paper contributes a maturity matrix based on important practices and lessons learned through extensive interview based case studies of three tactical aircraft programs, including experiences from more than 100 interviews.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Output from the 1998 Product Development Value Stream Workshop: A Framework for Understanding Information Flow in the Product Development Process</field><field name="creator">McManus, Hugh</field><field name="description">The descriptions below and the attached diagrams are outputs of the 1998 LAI Product Development Focus Team workshop on the Value Chain in Product Development.

Lean is the search for perfection through the elimination of waste and the insertion of practices that contribute to reduction in cost and schedule while improving performance of products. This concept of lean has wide applicability to a large range of processes, people and organizations, from concept design to the factory floor, from the laborer to the upper management, from the customer to the developer. Progress has been made in implementing and raising the awareness of lean practices at the factory floor.

The research finds that 40 percent of the projects studied were inadequately staffed, resulting in weaker team communications and alignment. Most importantly, the weak staffing on these teams is found to be associated with a doubling of project failure rate to reach full production. Those weakly staffed teams that did successfully insert technology into production systems were also much more likely than other teams to have development delays and late engineering changes. The conclusion suggests that the expense of project failure, delay and late engineering changes in these companies must greatly out-weigh the savings gained from reduced staffing costs, and that this problem is likely going to be found in other technology-intensive firms intent on seeing project budgets as a cost to be minimized rather than an investment to be maximized.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value Creation Through Integration Workshop</field><field name="creator">Warmkessel, Joyce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aerospace guidance computer analysis and synthesis,</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">by Robert W.

Mortalities (failures) were found in right segments with jL value as low as 1250 A/cm, and the mortality of a dotted-I segment is dependent on the direction and magnitude of the current in the adjacent segment. Some mortalities were also found in the right segments under a test condition where no failure was expected. Cu extrusion along the delaminated Cu/Si&#8323;N&#8324; interface near the central via region was believed to cause the unexpected failures. From the time-to-failure (TTF), it is possible to quantify the Cu/Si&#8323;N&#8324; interfacial strength and bonding energy. Hence, the demonstrated test methodology can be used to investigate the integrity of the Cu dual damascene processes. As conventionally determined critical jL values in two-terminal via-terminated lines cannot be directly applied to interconnects with branched segments, this also serves as a good methodology to identify the critical effective jL values for immortality.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Advanced Materials for Micro- and Nano-Systems (AMMNS);</field><field name="subject">Cu dual damascene processes</field><field name="subject">terminal &#226;&#128;&#152;dotted-I&#8217; interconnect structures</field><field name="subject">vias</field><field name="subject">dotted-I segments</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">silicon nitride</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical comparison between Maxwell stress method and equivalent multipole approach for calculation of the dielectrophoretic force in octupolar cell traps</field><field name="creator">Rosales, C.</field><field name="description">This work presents detailed numerical calculations of the dielectrophoretic force in octupolar traps designed for single-cell trapping.

By considering long wavelength deformations of the sheet, we derive an evolution equation for its motion, accounting for the  effects of  elastic bending, viscous lubrication and body forces.  We then analyze various steady and unsteady problems for the sheet such as peeling, healing, levitating and bursting using a combination of numerical simulation and dimensional analysis. On the macro-scale, we corroborate our theory with a simple experiment, and on the micro-scale, we analyze an oscillatory valve that can transform a continuous stream of fluid into a series of discrete pulses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">04-P-01;</field><field name="subject">elastic boundary</field><field name="subject">thin film</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7623</field><field name="identifier">Hosoi, A.

We compute these measures for the SDPLIB suite problem instances and measure the correlation between these measures and IPM iteration counts (solved using the software SDPT3) when the measures have finite values. Our conclusions are roughly as follows: the aggregate geometry measure is highly correlated with IPM iterations (CORR = 0.896), and is a very good predictor of IPM iterations, particularly for problem instances with solutions of small norm and aspect ratio. The condition measure C(d) is also correlated with IPM iterations, but less so than the aggregate geometry measure (CORR = 0.630). The near-absence of strict complementarity is weakly correlated with IPM iterations (CORR = 0.423). The level of degeneracy of the optimal solution is essentially uncorrelated with IPM iterations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation">Operations Research Center Working Paper Series;OR 374-05</field><field name="subject">problem instance behavior</field><field name="subject">interior-point method</field><field name="subject">semidefinite programming</field><field name="subject">aggregate geometry</field><field name="subject">IPM</field><field name="subject">SDP</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/7931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An interim report of research on stochastic and adaptive systems</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">by Michael Athans, Sanjoy K.

Residents of Libby, MT have experienced significant asbestos exposure due to an asbestos contaminated vermiculite mine near the community over several decades. Residents have developed numerous asbestos-related diseases as well as increased autoimmune responses. However, the exact mechanism by which Libby amphibole asbestos generates autoimmune responses is unclear. To elucidate a possible mechanism for asbestos induced autoimmunity, the cellular effects of Libby amphibole asbestos were characterized in vitro using a phagocytic murine macrophage cell line, which are characteristic of alveolar macrophages. Our results indicate that Libby amphibole asbestos generates oxidative stress in murine macrophages similar to crocidolite asbestos. However, Libby asbestos induces distinct cellular effects compared to crocidolite asbestos. Therefore, the cellular effects of amphibole asbestos may be a combined consequence of its chemical composition as well as the activation of distinct cellular pathways during exposure. Libby amphibole asbestos also induces apoptosis in murine macrophages resulting in the translocation of SSA/Ro52 to cell surface blebs of apoptotic cells. These apoptotic cell surface blebs are recognized by autoantibodies from mice exposed to amphibole asbestos, suggesting that these cell surface structures may be antigenic when presented in a pro-inflammatory context. These results suggest that the induction of apoptosis may play a key role in environmentally induced autoimmunity. Interestingly, autoantibodies found in the sera of the Libby cohort also recognize the SSA/Ro52 autoantigen, indicating that humans and mice exposed to amphibole asbestos generate similar AA profiles and that the alterations of the immune response by amphibole asbestos may be comparable. We hypothesize that asbestos-induced autoimmunity is generated through a two hit mechanism. First, autoantigens become visible to the immune system during apoptosis, which results in the accumulation of autoantigens on the cell surface. The subsequent uptake and processing of apoptotic cells by antigen-presenting cells in a pro-inflammatory context will activate self-reactive T cells, inducing the loss of tolerance and generate the autoimmune responses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01032008-103051/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leftovers: A Search for the Freegan Ideal</field><field name="creator">Darrell, Emily</field><field name="description">No abstract.

Several approaches have been undertaken to manipulate the effects of APCs for therapeutic purposes. Panax notoginseng is a medicinal herb that is purported to possess a number of properties including modulation of the immune system. However, limited information exists on the effects and toxicities of this herbal on APCs. In this regard, we assessed the effects of Panax notoginseng on the fate and function of professional APCs in murine models using macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). APCs were stimulated with the toll-like receptor ligands LPS, CpG and poly(I:C) and treated with notoginseng (0-200 &#236;g/ml). The LPS induced levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#225;, as well as the expression of accessory molecules MHC II, CD40 and CD86, were decreased dependent on notoginseng exposure time-points relative to LPS stimulation. LPS induced IL-1&#226;, IL-6 and IL-12 production was also decreased with concurrent notoginseng treatment for 24 hours. Notoginseng decreased TNF-&#225; and CD40 activation by CpG and poly(I:C), but had varied effects on the induction of IL-6 and CD86. Furthermore, treatment of APCs with ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1 had differential effects on the production of TNF-&#225; and IL-6. Phagocytosis of FITC-conjugated ovalbumin antigen by DCs was decreased by notoginseng. Furthermore, the uptake of FITC-conjugated modified LDL was reduced in notoginseng treated DCs. However, T cell proliferation in response to notoginseng treated-antigen-loaded DCs was not affected in vitro or in vivo. Mechanistically, notoginseng reduced nuclear levels of the transcription factor NF&#234;B, but had no effect on glucocorticoid receptor activation. No immunotoxicities were observed with low dose notoginseng (660 &#236;g/kg) treatment of Balb/c mice in vivo. Collectively, our results indicate that notoginseng decreased inflammatory mediator production by APCs, without altering their ability to induce antigen specific CD 4+ T cell proliferation. Our research provides insight into the potential use of this herbal in the treatment of inflammatory diseases as a safe and effective complement to existing remedies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

One of the important determinants of the quality of romantic relationships is the expression and regulation of emotions. This study hypothesized that 1) expression of positive emotions is good for any relationship, 2) expression of negative emotions is good for only communal relationships, 3) expression of positive emotions is necessary alongside of negative ones to maintain a communal relationship, 4) in case negative emotions are expressed, providing explanations would help maintain the relationship, 5) suppression of emotions does not benefit communal relationship, and 6) expression of emotions correlates with a) secure attachment, b) partner's receptiveness to expression, and c) communal approach to relationship. The interactions predicted in this study were not found to be significant. The key study findings follow: 1) expression of positive and negative emotions, 2) communal orientation, 3) explanation of negative affect, 4) and general emotional expressivity correlate with higher relationship satisfaction. 5) Emotional suppression, 6) anxious attachment, and 7) higher year in school were related to lower satisfaction. Other findings suggested that 1) communal approach, 2) partner's receptiveness, and 3) female gender were related to more emotional expressivity. 4) Communal orientation was related to more and 5) avoidant attachment was related to less positive expression. 6) Secure attachment was related to less emotional suppression. Lastly, it was found that 1) secure attachment correlated with more partner's receptiveness. 2) Anxious attachment accompanied less explanations for negative affect., and, 3) older participants had more avoidant attachments. The major limitation of this study was that only one member the couple was assessed and the impact of the respondent's style and behavior on the partner as well as the dyadic factors contributing to the relationship were largely unknown.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-100934/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-Control Choices Using Running Reinforcement</field><field name="creator">Brinegar, Jennifer Lynn</field><field name="description">Rats were given a choice between two amounts of a run-reward after responding on one of two equidistant levers. Responding on one lever resulted in the delivery of a smaller, immediate access to a running wheel (Impulsive) while responding on the other lever resulted in the delivery of larger but delayed access to a running wheel (Self-control). A variable inter-trial-interval was used to control the session duration regardless of the distribution of choices made by the subject. The results demonstrate that the use of a wheel-running reinforcer results in a significant self-control choice bias. This suggests that the use of a wheel-running reinforcer can be used alongside food and water reinforcers without having to undergo caloric deprivation.

REVIVING ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION AS PART OF THE PUBLIC CONSCIUSNESS: ADVERTISING IS THE MISSING TOOL.</field><field name="creator">Rademacher, Ross</field><field name="description">The organizations that make up the environmental movement have a great opportunity and challenge before them. These organizations could lead our nation in a time of great change. They could challenge the public to align personal consumer habits with positive environmental beliefs. However, the environmental movement has failed to market and communicate effectively. Due to this failure, companies such as Chevron and Wal-Mart have taken the moral high ground away from environmental organizations. The movement as a whole, with a few exceptions, has not successfully promoted key themes that could motivate change. There are rare examples of successful marketing and communication tactics from environmental groups. Effective fundraising techniques and an over dependence on public relations is often used in place of reliable advertising tactics. The majority of environmental organizations on the national, regional and state level have squandered opportunities to galvanize a broader audience base in the United States. Most environmental organizations have not kept up with the change in the overall populations attitude towards environmental dangers threatening the earth. The populace has the potential to become more aware and would be willing to act, if the NGOs, foundations and governmental bodies directed what type of action to take. With the ominous threat of global warming, people have not been moved to demand change from the government, private industry or particularly themselves. Environmental organizations must adopt a new marketing strategy in order to successfully lead the American public in this time of great change.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-104239/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Structure Function Relationship of Silica Polyamine Composites</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Mark Anthony</field><field name="description">The goals of this thesis were to improve the performance of silica polyamine composites by manipulating the surface structure and to understand the relationship between, polymer structure and ligand modification of the grafted polyamine. Improvements in silica polyamine composite performance resulted from modifying silica gel with methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) substituted for a molar fraction of reagent chloropropyltrichlorosilane (CPTCS), which has been traditionally employed. MTCS does not possess a terminal chloride group thus preventing the subsequent attachment of a polyamine to this moiety. MTCS has a smaller molecular volume than CPTCS and as a consequence greater coverage of the silica gel surface by silanes was determined by elemental analysis and NMR. An increase in the fraction of amines not attached to the surface (free amines) allowed improved mass transfer kinetics and in some cases improvements in metal ion sorption capacities of the polymer modified materials. Further, MTCS is cheaper than CPTCS thus allowing a more economically sound synthesis. As a result of an increase in free amines, silica gel polyamine composites were modified with sodium chloroacetate and other metal selective ligands in higher yield, resulting in a material with substantially improved copper ion capacities. Silica polyamine composites have also been modified with a novel series of amino acid chelating ligands for the purpose of selective extraction of heavy metals from aqueous media. The presence of the functional groups was confirmed by 13C NMR and elemental analysis. The adsorption properties of modified composites have been determined for divalent and trivalent metal ions. Cycle testing was performed to measure longevity. Selective extraction and recovery of a single metal ion from media containing multiple metal ions has been demonstrated. The structure of the polyamine used has been shown to have a significant impact on the specific selectivity of modified silica polyamine composites even when modified with the same ligand. Potential areas of application have been tested and appear promising. These include an acid mine drainage polluted stream near Helena, MT, as well as synthetic high pressure leach laterite solutions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inorganic</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-105039/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A small RNA regulates RpoS in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi</field><field name="creator">Lybecker, Meghan Catherine</field><field name="description">We have identified and characterized the first sRNA, DsrABb, in the Lyme disease spirochete, &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;; as well as, identified a non-canonical RNA chaperone Hfq. The alternative sigma factor RpoS (sigma 38 or sigma S) plays a central role in the reciprocal regulation of the virulence-associated major outer surface proteins OspC and OspA. Temperature is one of the key environmental signals controlling RpoS, but the molecular mechanism by which the signal is transduced remains unknown. DsrABb post-transcriptionally regulates the alternative sigma factor RpoS in response to an increase in temperature, associated with the tick to mammal transmission signal. A novel 5' end of the &lt;em&gt;rpoS&lt;/em&gt; mRNA was identified and DsrABb has the potential of extensively base-pairing with the upstream region of this &lt;em&gt;rpoS&lt;/em&gt; transcript. We demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;B. burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt; strains lacking DsrABb do not upregulate RpoS and OspC in response to an increase in temperature, but do regulate RpoS and OspC in response to changes in pH and cell density. The 5' and 3' ends of DsrABb were mapped, demonstrating that at least four species exist with sizes ranging from 213 to 352 nucleotides. We demonstrate and characterize in vitro the interaction between DsrA and upstream region of &lt;em&gt;rpoS&lt;/em&gt; mRNA. We hypothesize that DsrABb binds to the upstream region of the &lt;em&gt;rpoS&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and stimulates translation by releasing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start site from a stable secondary structure. Therefore, we postulate that DsrABb is a molecular thermometer regulating RpoS in &lt;em&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/em&gt;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-110120/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological Process and the Blister Rust Epidemic: Cone Production, Cone Predation, and Seed Dispersal in Whitebark Pine (Pinus albicaulis)</field><field name="creator">McKinney, Shawn Thomas</field><field name="description">Whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), a high elevation foundation species, is experiencing population declines throughout the northern part of its range. The introduced fungal pathogen, Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust), infects whitebark pine and kills cone-bearing branches and trees. Blister rust has spread nearly rangewide and damage and mortality are highest in the northwest US and southwest Canada. Mortality caused by mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) population upsurges, and successional replacement and loss of regeneration opportunities from fire suppression, are also impacting some whitebark pine populations. Within this dissertation, I present three manuscripts that address the impact of whitebark pine's decline on species interactions and ecological processes within subalpine forests. Research was conducted in three ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains USA that are distinct in whitebark pine health conditions (rust infection and mortality) and abundance. In the first manuscript, I explore how the relationship between whitebark pine and Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), its primary seed disperser, is being affected by whitebark's decline. Nutcrackers were less likely to use and disperse seeds from forests where cone production is below a threshold. In the second manuscript, I describe habitat use of whitebark pine forests by red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). Squirrel residency and impact of cone predation increased with decreasing whitebark pine abundance. The third manuscript focuses on the tree-level ecological process, predispersal cone survival, as a function of coarse scale whitebark pine abundance. Surviving trees in high mortality forests were found to have a lower rate and higher variability of cone survival, suggesting that the putative levels of rust-resistance in surviving trees of high mortality forests may not be passed on to future generations. At the ecosystem level, the Northern Divide had the highest levels of rust infection and tree mortality and lowest nutcracker interaction and regeneration levels; the Greater Yellowstone had the lowest infection and mortality levels and nutcrackers were present and dispersing seeds at all research sites in all years, while the Bitterroot Mountains were intermediate in these comparisons. These findings provide important components for developing a long-term strategy to conserve and restore whitebark pine ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest Management</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-111653/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resolving Employment Retention Barriers to Enhance Self-Sufficiency for Missoula County TANF Recipients</field><field name="creator">Holland, Deborah Evelyn</field><field name="description">This study examined the issues of barriers and employment retention in a rural county welfare-to-work setting, the Missoula, Montana WoRC Program. Qualitative research (study one) was conducted, to interview clients regarding reasons why they had lost jobs in the past, and, to elicit their suggestions regarding new services the WoRC Program could offer to help with employment retention at future jobs. Study one results indicated that the primary barriers resulting in job loss were: family issues; medical problems; mental health disorders; work site difficulties; and other (i.e. boredom, attitude problems). Work adjustment proved to be an underlying barrier to employment retention. Study one results demonstrated that the clients wanted three primary services to help resolve barriers and improve job retention: life skills classes teaching work adjustment; job coaching; and post-TANF supportive services (i.e. clothing and gas vouchers). Quantitative research (study two) was conducted to analyze 90 variables via logistic regression and determine whether or not the WoRC Program assisted clients with gaining employment, and if so, what the characteristics of those clients were. The results of the logistic regression indicated that the WoRC Program helped clients gain employment exactly 50% of the time. Statistically significant variables for clients that gained employment were: study one participant; female; on TANF 4+ months; final status (case closed at time of study); merit (not sanctioned); no short term training months; no learning disability; no domestic violence; and no chemical dependency. Linear regression was utilized to determine whether or not the employment WoRC clients gained paid better than the minimum wage. The results of the linear regression demonstrated that the mean wage for the employed study two clients was $7.16/hr. The Federal minimum wage at the time of the study was $5.15/hr. To place this study in context, the literature review traced the development of the welfare system from ancient times to the present day, with special emphasis on the topics of cycling, barriers and retention, as well as intangible factors that may have contributed to the study results.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01042008-112855/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mindfulness and Health Behaviors</field><field name="creator">Gilbert, Desleigh D</field><field name="description">Inadequate nutrition and physical inactivity have been recognized as key sources of morbidity and mortality (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services and U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 2005). The current study is interested in integrating mindfulness into interventions geared towards changing health behaviors. Mindfulness is a Buddhist-based concept that has received an increasing amount of attention by clinicians and researchers in the field of psychology and medicine over the past 20 years (Bishop et al., 2004). Although mindfulness has its roots in Buddhist spiritual practices, the integration of mindfulness into medical and mental health treatment has transpired primarily in a secular manner (Baer, 2003). Mindfulness has already been incorporated into the treatment of many psychological and physical disorders (e.g., Kabat-Zinn, 2003). The ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop and test a mindfulness-based intervention for health behavior change. As an initial step, the current study examined whether mindfulness is related to diet, physical activity, and self-efficacy. Method: Participants (204 females and 93 males, mean age = 20.9 years) were recruited from the Introduction to Psychology subject pool at the University of Montana for participation in this study. Participants completed the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), the FFMQ modified for mindful eating, as well as measures of physical activity, diet, self-efficacy, and stress. Results: Certain aspects of mindfulness appear to be related to specific health behaviors, lending partial support to the research hypotheses. Degree of mindfulness in everyday life was correlated with physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake, fat intake (males only), and self-efficacy. The results suggest that different aspects of mindfulness are important for males versus females. Clinical implications and future research areas are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01062010-183350/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SAGE-GROUSE AND THE HUMAN FOOTPRINT: IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION OF SMALL AND DECLINING POPULATIONS</field><field name="creator">Tack, Jason Duane</field><field name="description">Implementing conservation in the face of unprecedented landscape change requires an understanding of processes and scales that limit wildlife populations. We assessed landscape-level processes influencing sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), to a migratory population in the Milk River Basin (MRB), northeast Montana, USA, and south-central Saskatchewan, Canada. A regional analysis of leks (e.g., communal breeding sites) documented that populations impacted by the increasing extent of agricultural tillage, roads, and energy development out to spatial scales larger than previously known. Using bird abundance as a novel way to evaluate human impacts revealed relationships that would have been missed had we not incorporated lek size into analyses. For example, large leks are 4.5 times less likely to occur than small leks when agricultural tillage fragments 21% of land within 1.0km of breeding sites. Sage-grouse in the MRB met or exceeded demographic rates of stable or increasing populations, and thus, are not likely the cause for annual declines. Spring and summer survival of radio-marked females was higher in 2008 (0.91), than in 2007 (0.55), the year we documented an outbreak of West Nile virus. Nest sites in the MRB had lower shrub cover (15%) than range-wide estimates (15-56%), and overall shrub cover instead of sagebrush cover, was a better predictor of nest-site selection. Plains silver sagebrush (Artemesia cana cana) made up half of total shrub cover (7.1%) at nest sites, suggesting that other shrubs compensate for lower sagebrush densities in the MRB. We discovered the longest migratory event observed for sage-grouse, with females travelling 40km to120km from breeding to wintering areas in Wyoming big sagebrush (A. tridentata wyomingensis) habitats in Montana. Habitat may be sufficient to maintain a small population in the MRB, but its ability to persist through time and to buffer against stochasticity is depressed now that this once-large population has become small and isolated. For example, impacts of disease are compounded when acting on fewer individuals and working synergistically with fluctuations in growth rates. Consequently, conservation of sage-grouse in the MRB will depend on maintaining the current habitat base, and on restoring sagebrush-dominated grasslands currently occupied by agricultural tillage.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01072010-162544/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN EXAMINATION OF MORTALITY RATES OF MISSOULA COUNTY AS COMPARED TO STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS.</field><field name="creator">Yochim, Daniel John</field><field name="description">The rationale and implications of current methodologies for assessing mortality rates among spatially diverse human populations has importance to the field of Health Geography.

Responding to a lack of data regarding patient treatment preference generally (Spring, 2007), and preference for mindfulness-based treatment in particular, this study sought to examine factors related to patient choice in an analogue scenario. Method: Undergraduate students (121 male, 189 female, mean age = 19.6 years) watching a mental health professional on video were asked to imagine having a variety of anxiety symptoms described as either psychological or physical in nature. Participants then received descriptions of 3 treatment options [mindfulness-based treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and SSRI medication] and made a hypothetical treatment choice. Subsequently, they answered self-report measures of metacognitive awareness, openness to experience, inherent mindfulness, experiential avoidance, religiosity, and anxiety. Hypotheses: The description of anxiety (H1) and individual characteristics mentioned above (H2) were expected to be related to participants likelihood of engaging in a mindfulness-based treatment. Results: The description of anxiety as psychological was associated with a higher rate of individuals preferring a mindfulness-based treatment (&#247;2 = 5.06, p = .024). Also, metacognitive awareness and openness to experience appear to be predictive of increased willingness to choose a mindfulness-based treatment (&#226; = .245, p &lt; .001; &#226; = .246, p &lt; .001, respectively).

The former benefits from typical urban services and faces land use planning issues typical of city locales, including public transportation, brownfields and infill development, and enhancement of the urban core. The latter areas, by virtue of their rural nature, are the subject of an entirely different series of land use planning conversations. The unincorporated areas of the county, in towns such as Seeley Lake, Florence, Huson, and Frenchtown, consider land use planning issues in the context of impacts to water quality and wildlife, distance from services, and preservation of open space and agricultural land. When subdivisions of property are proposed in these areas, the proposals are evaluated by a set of criteria seeking to address these contexts, thereby addressing those qualities that for many County residents define the propertys rurality. Three case studies consisting of two subdivision proposals and a County effort to pinpoint rural residential fire protection requirements are analyzed from the point of view of the assigned case planner. The successes and failures, as well as the strengths and weaknesses, of each case are examined, and the outcomes are situated in the context of the larger surrounding area. The analysis sheds light on the often preventative role of the planner in rural subdivision planning in Missoula County and touches on the difficulties encountered in reviewing land development proposals in the area.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01122010-152911/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Heart Radical</field><field name="creator">King-Ries, Kristin Marie</field><field name="description">A young American woman goes to China looking for quiet and respite from campus activism but finds herself drawn into a love triangle with two Chinese dissidents.

Studies of growth responses need to consider multiple body components because components can compete for resources during growth in an integrated growth strategy. However, such studies are lacking and little is known about the extent to which body components may differ in their growth responses to environmental selection pressures. Theory predicts that growth of body components with relatively higher advantages for survival should be prioritized. For example, increases in time dependent mortality, like nest predation risk in birds, should favor growth of body features that enhance the ability to leave nests earlier. We studied 12 coexisting species of passerines to specifically test predictions that species with higher nest predation rates would prioritize growth of locomotor components (e.g. tarsi and wings) at the expense of growth of body mass. We also tested the prediction that these altricial birds should develop endothermy earlier to facilitate their ability to leave the warm nest environment. We found species that experience higher nest predation rates exhibited relatively faster growth rates of wing chord, but not tarsus, compared with body mass. Furthermore, species with higher nest predation rates achieved adult-sized tarsi and 60% of adult wing-chord lengths at relatively smaller body mass, further demonstrating the prioritization of wing and tarsus development. Species with higher nest predation risk also developed endothermy earlier at relatively smaller body mass. Thus, our results suggest that growth responses among species to differences in nest predation risk include an integrated strategy across body components to facilitate an ability to escape a risky environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01132009-180702/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invisible Woman</field><field name="creator">Howe, Kristin Deanne</field><field name="description">The aim of this paper is to illuminate the ways in which working class women are invisible within the feminist and ecofeminist movements.

The major findings suggest: (1) water use behaviors and diarrheal disease management are influenced by the tremendous seasonal fluctuations in the riverine environment; (2) local awareness of the relationship between poor water quality, oral-fecal disease transmission, and waterborne disease is low; (3) interventions to mitigate the high incidence of childhood diarrhea and degraded water quality are limited by ongoing socio-economic, cultural, and institutional factors; and (4) womens level of health knowledge is socially and culturally dependent.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01142010-090011/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovering Orientation between Theory and Narrative</field><field name="creator">Clark, Maxwell Haus</field><field name="description">Through the concept of orientation, this essay attempts to establish a philosophical account of the structure of our daily lives. By examining Kants notion of orientation and Heideggers response to Kant, I highlight the importance of the fact that orientation comes from the world, not simply from our ability to determine our position in the world by means of a coordinate system. Consequently, I argue, the concrete instantiation of a life given in a narrative can supplement the structure that the theoretical framework of justice, which establishes the principles guiding the institutions of our society, claims to leave undetermined. This texture fills the space of justice and culture with tangible things and practices that make up our daily life. The novel America America is used as a diagnostic tool to illuminate the forces and opportunities found in our culture that need to be either recognized and avoided, or discovered, revealed, and spoken for. I suggest that instrumental reason and the attainment of mere pleasure, as a cultural forces guiding our practices, fail to provide a tenable answer to the question of the good life and that they should be avoided when we are considering the ultimate how and what of the practices that make up the structure of our lives. In response to the failure of instrumental reason, I propose a deepening of our practices by way of familiarity (through closeness) and accomplishment (through engagement) with the things that are integral to practices such as making maple syrup and preparing a meal.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01152010-125350/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE MEANING OF MARKETS: HOW THE DOMESTIC FAIR TRADE ASSOCIATION UNDERSTANDS CREATING SOCIAL CHANGE USING MARKET INITIATIVES</field><field name="creator">Thorn, Emily Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Agriculture in North America has tended toward consolidation and industrialization in the past century. Responding to the narrowing of market advantage for small-scale organic farmers and the plight of farm workers, as well as to both the failures and potentials of international fair trade and organic initiatives, members of the nascent Domestic Fair Trade Association (DFTA) seek to insert social justice into the North American food system using a market-based initiative mediated by independent that conform to stringent criteria. This study examines the meaning of fair trade in a North American context; the challenges facing domestic fair trade initiatives, and the ways the DFTA confronts them; and the ways those involved with the DFTA intend to move ahead with a domestic fair trade initiative. I argue that through a strong collaborative approach both structurally and in its vision for a transformed food system, the DFTA may bring a new and productive element to the discussion of alternative agro-food initiatives in North America. Central to DFTA members understanding of their goals is the formation of a coalition representing all the stakeholders in the food system, the creation of alternative economic models which embody social justice, the education and empowerment of the consumer as a political actor, and the role of policy in a complete transformation of the food system.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01192010-141828/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resource Debate in Southwest Alaska: The Bristol Bay Fishery and the Pebble Mine</field><field name="creator">Gottschalk, Ethan Jermome</field><field name="description">Bristol Bay, in Southwest Alaska, is the largest sockeye salmon fishery in the world. After an almost total collapse of salmon numbers in the mid 1970s, the salmon have returned and average in the tens of millions every year. The salmon play a vital economic, cultural, and subsistence role in the lives of the people who call Bristol Bay home. At present there is a plan to develop a low-grade, but substantial, mineral deposit that consists primarily of copper, gold, and molybdenum. The estimated value of the minerals present is more than $500 billion. This plan is known as the Pebble Project, and could involve an open-pit mine, a large area of block caving, as well as the creation of huge tailings ponds north of Lake Iliamna. The proposed site of the mine straddles a drainage divide that affects two major watersheds that feed the Bristol Bay fishery. A resource debate is at hand which places the development of the mineral deposit at odds with the health of the fishery.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01222010-112628/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSMENT AND POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SNOW-RELATED ALGORITHMS IN BIOME-BGC, v4.2</field><field name="creator">DeWire, Deana Ann</field><field name="description">Many watersheds throughout the mountain west are snow-melt dominated. Recent studies suggest that climatic shifts throughout the 20th century have diminished snowpack around the west, a trend that may accelerate in the future. Loss of critical snowpack could negatively affect the ecosystems and communities that have come to depend on it. Process models offer a way to illuminate the effects of climate change on snowpack. BIOME-BGC, a well established eco-system process model, contains a simple snow melt model for predicting daily snow water equivalent (SWE). The model requires standard daily meteorological data and can, therefore, be extrapolated over long periods of record. This research evaluated the effectiveness of BIOME-BGC (v4.2) at predicting SWE, snowpack evolution, and soil temperature. Then, several physically based algorithms were incorporated into current model logic and model behavior was evaluated. Finally, a new degree-day algorithm was presented and assessed for inclusion into future versions of BIOME-BGC. The study concluded that the new degree-day algorithm should be investigated further as it offered the best results.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-01262009-124733/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of a Web Application for Testing Memory Retrieval Through the Development and Utilization of Customizable Exams</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Kevin Shea</field><field name="description">Students in academic environments today use ever evolving technology to complete their academic tasks.

Moving from a socialistic system into a free-market economy of supply and demand saw regulatory institutions, which historically managed natural resources like rangelands, dissolved or without the capacity to enforce their work requirements. Like other places in Russia, the region of the Kosh-Agach Wildlife Refuge experienced a decrease in demand for livestock products, which forced many rural peoples to move to urban areas in search of work. The opposite occurred in the region of western Mongolia where the so-called Cluster A of the Siilkhemiin Nuruu National Park is located. That Region saw an increase in migration from urban to rural areas to embrace their traditional pastoralist lifestyle in order to make a living. This study uses satellite imagery, remote sensing analysis, and field data to assess rangeland conditions in these two protected areas over the past twenty years. The study concludes that rangeland conditions are deteriorating in both areas. Yet more research is needed in order to assess the levels at which climatic and anthropogenic factors are influencing this decline.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-02062008-111210/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracking the Trickster Home: The Animal Nature of Words in the Writing of Gerald Vizenor and Barry Lopez</field><field name="creator">Hawley, Steven Jubitz</field><field name="description">To be uploaded later.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03012007-101943/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood at the Root: Of Myth, Food, Race, and Landscape in the American South</field><field name="creator">Meeks, Catherine</field><field name="description">To be added later.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03012007-132623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Freeport</field><field name="creator">Piercy, Meghan Jennifer</field><field name="description">No abstract available</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English, Creative Writing, Journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03012007-150723/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Allomorphic Variation of Definite Articles in Jersey: a Sonority Based Account</field><field name="creator">McCarvel, Miranda Kelly</field><field name="description">Allomorphic variation is a common linguistic phenomenon in Jersey (Jersey Norman French). Definite articles in Jersey each have at least two allomorphs. The occurrence of each allomorph has been attributed to the composition of word initial syllable following the article (Liddicoat 1994). Instead of using a ruled-based approach, this thesis examines the variation found among Jersey definite articles and uses sonority-based principles to analyze the allomorphic variation. Using Jersey phonotactics, this thesis first puts forth a Jersey specific sonority hierarchy and then utilizes that hierarchy and principles of syllabification to syllabify phrases containing definite articles. Then using sonority based principles, such as the Sonority Sequencing Principle and Syllable Contact Law, this thesis analyzes the syllabified phrases. The analysis identifies the sonority based conditions that trigger the allomorphic variation found in the data. This thesis contributes to the field of linguistics in several ways. It supports the use of both the Universal Sonority Hierarchy and language specific sonority hierarchies. This thesis also supports the practice of using available data sources for analysis. The analysis of a described but analyzed phenomenon contributes valuable information to the general knowledge of Jersey and sonority. Finally, this thesis also serves as an important resource for the study of Norman dialects in Europe such as Guernsey, Sark and Norman, as Jersey is a member of this linguistic group. This thesis contributes to both the field of Jersey linguistics and to the field of theoretical linguistics, while accounting for the allomorphic variation of Jersey definite articles.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03082010-102529/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOLOGICAL CONTROL: EFFECTS OF TYRIA JACOBAEAE ON THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF SENECIO JACOBAEA IN NORTHWEST MONTANA</field><field name="creator">Crider, Kimberly Kay</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Biological control, using introduced, specialist insects is a common strategy for controlling plant invasions. However, the efficacy of biological control agents in controlling their host plants is rarely quantified population level. I quantified the impact of a specialist biological control agent, the cinnabar moth &lt;i&gt;(Tyria jacobaeae)&lt;/i&gt; on its host plant, tansy ragwort &lt;i&gt;(Senecio jacobaea)&lt;/i&gt; in northwest Montana. Cinnabar moth damage and its effects on important plant vital rates were tested with and without specialist herbivores. The presence of moth larvae corresponded to a reduction in population growth rates to less than one, compared to herbivore-free controls, indicating the potential for successful biological control by this insect. However, delayed effects of cinnabar moth herbivory on tansy ragwort vital rates were realized during the year following moth herbivory, after the moths had disappeared from the system. Individual damage to flowering plants in 2005 led to increased survival of these plants in the following year compared to controls, by reverting back to a vegetative state. In addition, seed set was reduced in plants that were damaged as juvenile rosettes in 2005 that went on to flower in 2006. When these delayed effects were combined in matrix models, gains in adult survival did not outweigh the decreases in fecundity or transition rates in terms of population growth and our initial conclusions remained unchanged. However, further study revealed that moth larvae were more likely to be depredated by carpenter ants in xeric sites suggesting that moth populations may not be sustained in these areas. Cinnabar moth larvae can be effective in this system provided they consume a large number of seeds (&gt;90%) in consecutive years, but requires that moth populations are established and sustained from year to year. While herbivores do show the ability to control an invasive plant species, this relationship is strongly contextual in this system. This work emphasizes the importance of recognizing the influence of habitat context on the outcome plant-herbivore interactions, specifically in invaded ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03092010-140634/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SIMPLE TWO-SIDED RATIONAL VECTOR SPACES OF RANK TWO</field><field name="creator">Hart, John Walker</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this thesis is to find sufficient conditions under which a non-commutative version of the polynomial ring in two variables exists. The non-commutative rings we construct are non-commutative symmetric algebras over a two-sided vector space. After reviewing the definition of a two-sided vector space and giving some examples, we briefly recall the theory of simple two-sided vector spaces. We then assume k is a field of characteristic zero and t is transcendental over k and we find sufficient conditions under which a simple k-central two-sided vector space V over k(t) has left and right dimension two. Given such a V, and letting &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;V and V&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; denote the left and right duals we find conditions under which (V&lt;sup&gt;i*&lt;/sup&gt;,V&lt;sup&gt;(i+1)*&lt;/sup&gt;,V&lt;sup&gt;(i+2)*&lt;/sup&gt; ) has a simultaneous for all i, i an integer.

Wingbeat frequency is hypothesized to ultimately constrain flight performance via muscular mechanical power output because frequency decreases with body size. I measured maximal burst take-off and vertical accelerating flight in 32 species of songbirds (Passeriformes), including the entire range of body mass in this clade (5-900 g). Jump forces against the ground were recorded with a forceplate. High-speed digital video captured the movement of morphological landmarks in order to estimate aerodynamic power requirements and dynamic morphology in flight. Surgically implanted gauges recorded the components of muscle power (muscle length change, force production, frequency) in the four largest species (Common raven, American crow, Black-billed magpie, and Gray jay). Flight performance and total aerodynamic power scaled with negative allometry, but were significantly influenced by foraging ecology. Species that forage on the ground had relatively lower jump impulses, shorter wings, higher wingbeat frequencies, and higher power output than species that forage on elevated substrates. I also found two unexpected internal scaling patterns. Both proportional muscle length change (muscle strain) and average cross-sectional area specific force (muscle stress) increased with size. Longer wingbeat cycles may permit more complete muscle activation in larger birds, thereby partially compensating for the constraint imposed by wingbeat frequency. These data offer the strongest support and the only direct evidence for power-limited scaling of flight performance to date.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03102010-100229/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">KNOWING THE NATURAL WORLD: THE CONSTRUCTION OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT EVOLUTION IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Alison Emily Havard</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Evolution is a central underlying concept to a significant number of discourses in civilized society, but the complexity of understanding basic tenets of this important theory is just now coming to light. Knowledge about evolution is constructed from both formal and "free-choice" opportunities, like television. Nature programs are commonly considered "educational" by definition, but research indicates the narratives often promote creationist ideas about this important process in biology. I explored how nature programs influenced knowledge construction about evolutionary theory using a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Because misconceptions about evolution are common, I examined how students` conceptual ecologies changed in response to information presented in an example of a particularly poor nature film narrative. Students` held a diversity of misconceptions, proximate conceptions, and evolutionary conceptions simultaneously, and many of their responses were direct reflections of the nature program. As a result, I incorporated the same nature program into an experiment designed to examine the effects of narrative and imagery on evolution understanding. After completing an extensive pre-assessment that addressed attitudes and beliefs about science knowledge, students viewed one of four versions of the nature program that varied in the quality of science and imagery presented. The effect of watching different versions was only vaguely apparent in students with a moderate understanding of evolution. The relationship was much more complex among students with a poor understanding of evolution but suggested a negative effect that was more influenced by public discourses about this "controversial" subject than conceptual understanding. The relationships warranted examining learning from the perspective of the consumers of these programs. I surveyed audience beliefs about the educational value of nature programs and found that an overwhelming majority believed the programs were "educational" and designed to teach about nature. The results were particularly alarming because beliefs about the educational value may strongly impact learning outcomes. An informal survey of nature programs aired during a "sweeps" month indicated that poor presentation of science, and specifically evolutionary theory, was indeed the norm. Indeed, nature programs may be contributing to the "deconstruction" of knowledge about evolution both in and out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03102010-111612/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Taxonomy of Rules: Authority, Dangers, and Possibilities</field><field name="creator">Friedman, Muriel Rebecca</field><field name="description">Rules, originally a means toward group solidarity, are the alternative to the need for ongoing physical dominance.

Rules in general are discussed from social and ethical theoretical viewpoints and using ideal type methodology. Understanding that there are different types of rules and the authority behind them makes it easier to determine ones obligations to follow them, especially with the notion of prima facie duties. A century after Max Weber wrote of his admiration--and fear--of bureaucratic authority, we should be alarmed at the march toward bureaucratic, algorithmic rule by a rule that, in its attempts toward fairness and certainty, in fact dominates us by turning us into standardized machines rather than thoughtful, intuitive, creative people.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03202009-115827/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Causes and consequences of the postfire increase in deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) abundance</field><field name="creator">Zwolak, Rafal Pawel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Wildfire triggers an increase in deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) abundance. Here, I describe this phenomenon, investigate its causes, and explore the consequences of the postfire increase in mice for conifer recruitment in burned forest. I documented a shift in small mammal communities away from more specialized species such as red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) and shrews (Sorex spp.) and towards greater abundance of generalist deer mice after a wildfire in montane forest. I conducted a meta-analysis of published studies on the abundance of small mammals in disturbed versus undisturbed forests and established that the pattern of increased deer mouse abundance holds for both natural (wildfire) and anthropogenic (different forms of forest harvest) disturbances. However, the postfire increase is significantly stronger than the increase after logging. In another forest wildfire, I tested the four most commonly proposed explanations of this increase: (1) greater abundance of food resources in burned areas, (2) increased foraging efficiency of deer mice, (3), predatory release, and (4) source - sink dynamics, with burned areas acting as high abundance dispersal sink. However, none were supported by data. Thus, I concluded that the existing explanations of postfire increase in deer mouse abundance are unsatisfactory. Finally, I investigated the magnitude and impact of seed predation by deer mice in burned and unburned forest. In seed offerings experiments, overnight conifer seed removal associated with deer mice was more intense in burned than in unburned stands. In germination experiments, emergence of seedlings in cages with openings that allowed access by deer mice was extremely rare in burned and unburned forest. However, in closed cages (deer mice excluded), seedling emergence was low in unburned forest, but considerably higher in burned forest. Wildfire created favorable conditions for seedling recruitment but seed predation by deer mice appeared to remove this advantage.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03212009-152016/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of a Family of Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter 3 (EAAT3) Preferring Inhibitors.</field><field name="creator">Mavencamp, Terri Lynn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This work describes the synthesis and initial characterization of the biological activity of a family of EAAT3 preferring inhibitors, L-&amp;beta;-benzyl aspartate (L-&amp;beta;-BA) and L-&amp;beta;-BA derivatives. L-&amp;beta;-BA and derivatives were initially synthesized in an approximate 2:1 ratio of diasteromers (threo:erythro), using base promoted enolate addition. Kinetic analysis of 3H-D-aspartate uptake into C17.2 cells expressing the hEAATs demonstrated that L-threo-&amp;beta;-BA is the more potent diastereomer (Ki values of 9 &#181;M for EAAT1, 10.0 &#181;M for EAAT2 and 0.8 &#181;M for EAAT3), acts competitively, and exhibits a 10-fold preference for EAAT3 compared to EAAT1 and EAAT2. Electrophysiological recordings of EAAT-mediated currents in Xenopus oocytes further identified L-&amp;beta;-BA as a non-substrate inhibitor. Derivatives of L-&amp;beta;-BA were prepared and characterized for the ability to inhibit 3H-D-aspartate uptake into hEAAT1-3 expressing C17.2 cells. Computational modeling and analysis of structure activity data suggest the area the aromatic moiety of L-&amp;beta;-BA derivatives probe is 1) 3-dimentionally confined, 2) more tolerant of substitutions at the 3 and 5 positions than the 4 position, 3) at least partially distinct from the area probed by L-TBOA and 4) more accessible in the EAAT3 protein than EAAT1 and EAAT2. Computational modeling supports the pharmacological data and lends insight into the selectivity observed with L-&amp;beta;-BA derivatives. Docking studies suggest that H-bonding interactions of L-&amp;beta;-BA derivatives with key residues in the binding site position L-&amp;beta;-BA analogues in a unique manner that is better tolerated in the EAAT3 protein than in the EAAT1 and EAAT2 proteins.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

I assessed sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) large scale habitat ecology and response to energy development in the winter and nesting seasons using radio-marked individuals in the Powder River Basin, Montana and Wyoming, USA. Landscape scale percent sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) cover at 4-km2 was the strongest predictor of use by sage-grouse in winter. After controlling for vegetation and topography, the addition the density of coal-bed natural gas wells within 4 km2 improved model fit (AIC -6.66, wi = 0.965) and indicated that sage-grouse avoided energy development. Nesting analyses showed that landscape context must be considered in addition to local scale habitat features (wi = 0.96). Findings provide managers a hierarchical filter in which to manage breeding habitats. Twice the amount of nesting habitat at 3, 5 and 10-km scales surrounded active leks versus random locations. Spatially explicit nesting and wintering models predicted independent sage-grouse locations (validation R2 &#8805; 0.98). I incorporated knowledge of energy impacts into a study design that tested for threshold responses at regional scales analyzing 1,344 leks in Wyoming from 1997-2007. Potential impacts were indiscernible at 1-12 wells within 32.2 km2 of a lek (~1 well / 640 ac). At higher wells densities a time-lag showed higher rates of lek inactivity and steeper declines in bird abundance 4 years after than immediately following development. I spatially prioritized core areas for breeding sage-grouse across Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Utah and the Dakotas and assessed risk of future energy development. Findings showed that bird abundance varies by state, core areas contain a disproportionately large segment of the breeding population and that risk of development within core areas varies regionally. My analyses document behavioral and demographic responses to energy development, offer new insights into large scale ecology of greater sage-grouse and provide resource managers with practical tools to guide conservation.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03262009-132629/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF A NEURONAL GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER</field><field name="creator">Leary, Gregory Patrick</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporters have a homotrimeric subunit structure with a large central water-filled cavity that extends partially into the plane of the lipid bilayer (Yernool et al., 2004). In addition to uptake of glutamate, the transporters also mediate a chloride conductance that is gated by Na+ and glutamate. Our data indicate that glutamate binding sites, transport pathways, and chloride channels reside in individual subunits in the trimer and function independently and that the anion channel is gated by alkali cations binding from either side of the membrane. We also investigated conformational changes during glutamate binding by incorporating a fluorescent probe into a site near the postulated external gate (HP2) of a mutant transporter that can bind but not transport L-Glu. Fluorescence changes were observed upon ligand binding that strongly depended on the number of subunits labeled; this suggests quenched fluorophore dimers form at the center of the trimer that are subject to HP2 loop closure upon substrate binding. This supports a model of gate motion that is also consistent with recent x-ray structural data (Boudker et al., 2007).

One scheduling format followed a more traditional approach where courses were taken at the same time as at least one other course and in a time frame more resembling a typical semester. This distributed practice model, or cohort approach, required a prerequisite beginning level course or appropriate substitute course before enrolling in an advanced word processing course, thus spreading the instructional time over a longer timeframe. The other scheduling format allowed students to take only one course at a time, thus a massed practice model, in a compressed time format that presented the contents of the entire course in 18 instructional days. Student academic performance was measured by a subset of equivalent posttest questions that were common to both scheduling formats. Retention performance during the cohort approach was measured by a subset of equivalent questions common to the beginning and advanced cohort courses. The entire population of word processing students at this university was studied and thus there is no generalizability from this study to another population. Participants self-selected into groups by enrolling in course sections. Simple means were used to compute descriptive and comparative statistics. The distributed practice cohort group out-performed the massed practice group by an experimentally important five percent on the posttest. Results from the retention portion of the study indicate additional research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03262009-140539/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of SPARC on Collagen Deposition in Asbestos-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis</field><field name="creator">Smartt, Aubrey Meghan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Pulmonary fibrosis involves the invasion of lung tissue with fibrotic, scar tissue and affects roughly five million people total worldwide. Fibrotic development in the lung has several causes, including chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, medical compounds, and environmental agents. There is no known cure for the disease, but only therapies to improve quality of life. Scar tissue formation must be targeted in order to begin to provide any type of cure for fibrotic diseases. In this study, asbestos was used to induce pulmonary fibrosis in a mouse model and gene expression studies were then performed to identify potential candidate genes involved in asbestos response. One gene with the potential to regulate the fibrotic response is SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), a matricellular protein involved in tissue repair, extracellular matrix (ECM) regulation, cellular proliferation, and cellular adhesion. The goal of this project was to determine the role of SPARC in fibrosis development after asbestos exposure, specifically targeting how lack of SPARC expression can influence collagen production. I hypothesize that SPARC is a necessary component involved in the fibrotic response to asbestos through an influence on collagen deposition in the lung. I have found that the expression of SPARC is increased in the lungs of C57Bl/6 wild-type mice exposed to asbestos. This increase in expression correlates to higher collagen deposition in the lung. The absence of SPARC in these treated mice resulted in a reduction of the level of collagen deposition back to baseline. To determine the therapeutic potential of these findings, SPARC expression was reduced by small interfering RNA (siRNA) in wild-type mice already suffering from fibrosis. Collagen deposition in the fibrotic mice that received the SPARC siRNA vector showed a significant decrease in collagen accumulation when compared to those that did not receive the vector. Overall, these results indicate that expression of SPARC is a significant step in the development of lung fibrosis through the modulation of collagen deposition and therefore, SPARC may be a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

This is the case for all of the major programs: business administration, educational leadership, military science, and public administration. However, these evaluations themselves are limited inasmuch as they are typically concerned with such dimension as students' satisfaction and faculty credentials and performance while organizational outcomes attributable to leadership are ignored. The present research investigates the relationship of institutional outcomes for colleges and universities and the presence or absences of presidents with formal leadership training. The outcomes indicators are those contained in the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data Systems (IPEDS), and include variables such as tuition affordability, graduation rates, availability of student leans, and faculty salaries and benefits. A mixed methodology is used: A quantitative analysis of important IPEDS indicators and a content analysis of interviews with selected presidents. The quantitative analysis employed inferential statistics using a random sample groups of 100 presidents--one with formal leadership education, and a second group of 100 without such education--to determine the relationship- between success and the presidents' credentials. Using IPEDS data, it was found overall that presidents with formal leadership education are no more and no less likely to run successful colleges than their counterparts without such training. When comparing colleges of similar student body size and setting, four-or-more year colleges that employ presidents with no formal leadership education where three times more likely to be successful as compared to colleges that employ presidents with formal leadership education. This trend is reversed among two-to-four year schools. Those schools that employ presidents with formal leadership education were two times more likely to be successful as compared to those without formal leadership education. These data suggest a niche in which presidents with formal leadership education are most successful. The content analysis used interviews of the presidents. Those with formal leadership training, all referred to their education as being important to their responsibilities and all presidents interviewed felt that using IPEDS data in making institutional decisions was important. Implications of the finding form training programs and for future are offered.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03262009-144239/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation and Assessment of a Test Anxiety Reduction Program with 10th Graders and Their Subsequent Performance on the MontCAS Criterion Referenced Test</field><field name="creator">Bishop, Nilda Soto</field><field name="description">This quantitative study investigated the relationship between performance on the MontCAS Criterion Referenced Test of 10th graders at Corvallis High School, Corvallis, Montana who participated in a systematic program for test anxiety reduction, and 10th graders who took the MontCAS but did not participate in the test anxiety reduction program. The population included all 10th graders at Corvallis High School who failed to achieve a score of proficient or higher, or who achieved in the low-proficient range on either the reading or math section on the last MontCAS administration, which was two years prior to this study.

The development of a seawater pH sensor which is highly accurate and precise has unlimited potential for oceanographic studies. A seawater instrument for pH measurements was built based upon the design of the SAMI-pH for freshwater. The performance of the freshwater design in a seawater setting was unknown. During a cruise in the Labrador Sea the first design of the SAMI-pH for seawater based upon the previous instrument design was tested. The results showed promise but indicated that improvements needed to be made to the stability and reproducibility of the instrument to achieve the desired accuracy of 0.002 pH units and precision of 0.001 pH units. Since a full scale optimization of the SAMI-pH had never been undertaken, multiple parameters were tested. The old Delrin flow cell was replaced with a custom made Z-cell, which improved the absorbance precision. A commercially available static mixer was used to produce reproducible mixing of the indicator and sample. The indicator concentration and indicator pH were optimized to maximize the linearity of the [mCP]T vs. pH plots and to reduce the flushing volume which increased the deployment length. A new method of calculating molar absorptivity ratios was evaluated and the SAMI-pH accuracy was found to be 0.0017 when compared to the Cary UV/Vis. The precision showed excellent improvement from 0.004 to 0.0007 with the new SAMI-pH design. In situ testing of two SAMI-pH instruments was completed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Agreement of -0.0047 pH units between the two SAMI-pH instruments during a 22-day period with 883 measurements illustrates the highly accurate and stable performance of the SAMI-pH. An alternative method for pH determination based on theoretical calculations was also tested. The average offset between pH values calculated from the linear extrapolation technique and the theoretical model was -0.0008 pH units illustrating that the linear extrapolation is a rigorous method for determining the pH of the solution.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03282007-162542/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HABITAT USE AND THE EFFECTS OF DISTURBANCE ON WINTERING BIRDS USING RIPARIAN HABITATS IN SONORA, MEXICO</field><field name="creator">Villasenor, Jose Fernando</field><field name="description">Riparian systems are important for breeding bird communities and are highly used as migratory corridors; however, their importance for wintering birds has not been assessed systematically. In order to assess the value of riparian areas for birds wintering in Sonora, data from 1,816 standard point counts were collected from 87 locations during January and February 2004-2006. A total of 253 species were detected across 14 vegetation types, including nine categories of riparian vegetation. The mean number of species and individuals detected per count was significantly higher in riparian vegetation than in non-riparian vegetation for migratory species, but not for residents. Riparian bird communities are different from those in non-riparian habitats, and contribute 22% of the regional avifauna's species.&lt;br&gt;Anthropogenic disturbance has imposed significant changes in riparian habitats, and is known to have negative effects on biological communities. To assess the effects of human induced disturbance on wintering bird communities, I recorded community composition, relative abundance of species, and three indicators of bird condition in relatively undisturbed and highly disturbed sites at three river systems in Sonora. There is, in general, little effect of disturbance on the composition of wintering communities, with less than 20% of the most common species having significant differences in their abundances between relatively undisturbed and highly disturbed sites. Condition indicators were similar in the two disturbance levels, but the mean heterophil/lymphocyte ratio in the blood of sampled birds showed increased levels of physiological stress in disturbed sites. A more experimental approach is needed to determine the specific cause of the stress expression in leucocytes.&lt;br&gt;Modification of natural flooding regimes has modified riparian areas, as has been the case in the Colorado River Delta. I present a summary of the changes experienced by riparian systems and some of the measures implemented for riparian restoration in the southwestern United States, and then I compare the scenario with that in central Sonora, where some of the same stressors exist on riparian systems, but where traditional management practices have also mitigated some of the negative consequences of flow control along mid-sized river systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03282007-165836/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NO SIMPLE TRADEOFFS: CENTAUREA PLANTS FROM AMERICA ARE BETTER COMPETITORS AND DEFENDERS THAN PLANTS FROM THE NATIVE RANGE</field><field name="creator">Ridenour, Wendy Margaree</field><field name="description">Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for invasive success have important evolutionary implications. The 'natural enemies' hypothesis posits that exotic invaders explode in abundance because they are not suppressed by specialist herbivore consumers in their invaded range. The 'novel weapons' hypothesis posits that exotic invaders explode in abundance because they possess biochemicals that are more effective against evolutionarily na&#239;ve plants, microbes, and generalist herbivores than against those species that have evolved tolerance in their communities of origin. I explored the potential for novel allelopathic or herbivore defense biochemicals as a potential alternative mechanism to tradeoff-driven evolution of increased competitive ability in invasive plants by comparing growth, reproduction, competitive effect and response, and defense capabilities of invasive North American populations of Centaurea maculosa to populations in Europe, where the species is native. I found that Centaurea from North America were larger, but produced fewer flowers than plants from European populations. North American Centaurea demonstrated much stronger competitive effects and responses than European Centaurea against North American grasses. Importantly, competitive superiority did not appear to come at a cost to herbivore defense. North American Centaurea genotypes were better defended against specialist and generalist consumers, and showed both a stronger inhibitory effect on the consumers (resistance) and a better ability to grow in response to attack by herbivores (tolerance). Better defense by North Americans corresponded with higher constitutive levels of biochemical defense compound precursors, tougher leaves, and more leaf trichomes than Europeans. North American F1 progeny of field collected lines retained the traits of larger size and greater leaf toughness suggesting that genetic differences, rather than maternal effects, caused the intercontinental differences. My results indicate that the evolution of increased competitive ability may not always be driven by simple physiological tradeoffs between the allocation of energy or resources to growth or to defense. Instead, I hypothesize that new plant neighbors and generalist herbivores encountered by Centaurea in its invaded range appear to exert strong directional selection on the weed's competitive and defense traits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-03292007-102153/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical Activity Patterns in Missoula Youth</field><field name="creator">Mohar, Laura Leigh</field><field name="description">STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Physical activity (PA) is a critical determinant of long term health and is necessary for the prevention of youth onsetadult diseases. It is recommended that all youth accumulate at least 60+ min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) most days of the week in bouts lasting at least 10 min. PURPOSE: To evaluate the PA patterns of Missoula youth in order to make better recommendations for PA interventions for a wellness policy. METHODS: 324 elementary and middle school students from 5 schools wore accelerometers on their wrists for 5 days. The data were converted to activity energy expenditure (AEE) and also evaluated for single min and bouts of activity lasting at least 10 min of MVPA daily, in- versus out-of-school, and during sport, physical education (PE), and recess. Grade and gender differences were also assessed. RESULTS: The data show better than national averages in daily min of MVPA, with 70% of all students meeting the recommendation in 10 min bouts. Students showed low levels of MVPA during PE, recess, and sport. Sport was responsible for the highest accumulation of MVPA, followed by recess and then PE in both 1 and 10 min bouts. There was a drop in MVPA in both genders as grade level increased (both in and out of school), with more MVPA in single and 10 min bouts occurring out of school than in school. Males showed higher levels of MVPA than females during PE in 1 min bouts, recess in 1 and 10 min bouts, and in school in 1 and 10 min bouts. When scaled for body weight, genders did not differ in AEE. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest an overall healthy youth PA environment in Missoula. However, the 30% of students not meeting the recommendations for health in 10 min bouts are still of concern. Interventions could focus on encouraging slight increases of MVPA during PE, sport, and recess, especially at the middle school level. Increasing out of school MVPA is also necessary to make the biggest impact due to already overburdened school systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04142008-112420/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL RESPONSES TO BIOCHARS IN SOILS - POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF INTERACTION AND OBSERVED RESPONSES IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS</field><field name="creator">Warnock, Daniel</field><field name="description">The following thesis is a two-part study, investigating the influences of biochar (charcoal) on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The first part of this study is a critical examination and conceptual overview of the literature regarding biochar and AMF available before July 2007. In the second part, I present three experiments all designed to evaluate the influences of biochar applications on AMF abundance in primarily temperate, neutral pH soils. This course of research was selected through an exstensive review of the literature suggesting that biochar presence can strongly affect both soil microbial populations, including mycorrhizal fungi, and biogeochemistry. As both biochar and mycorrhizal associations are subject to management, and because both components are potentially important in various ecosystem services provided by soils (e.g., sustainable plant production) understanding and exploiting interactions between them could be advantageous. After reviewing the experimental evidence for such effects, four mechanisms are proposed by which biochar could influence mycorrhizal abundance and/ or functioning. These mechanisms are: a) alteration of soil physico-chemical properties; b) indirect effects on mycorrhizae through effects on other soil microbes; c) plant-fungus signaling interference and detoxification of allelochemicals; and d) provision of refugia from fungal grazers. Through this overview, a roadmap for research is provided, which is aimed at testing these mechanistic hypotheses. Using this proposed framework as a template, three experiments were designed and implemented, incorporating three different soils, five different biochars, and eight different biochar application rates. Through these experiments, it was illustrated that five different types of biochar are all capable of significantly altering soil orthophosphate availabilities, with four of these biochars not significantly affecting soil pH. Overall, our results indicate that AMF abundances were either unchanged or decreased with biochar amendment across multiple treatments. These results also indicate that biochar, depending on the nature of the feedstock, the temperature attained during pyrolysis and amounts applied can significantly alter soil properties including phosphate availability. These findings may have implications for soil management where the goal is to increase the services provided by AMF.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integrative Micriobiology and Biochemsitry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04162009-110852/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mistaken in the Man: The Life, Death, and Estate Trial of John McClellan</field><field name="creator">Olsen, Peter Nels</field><field name="description">John McClellan was among the original founders of the Sioux Falls town site in Dakota Territory in the year 1857. During his lifetime, McClellan never spoke much about his family or his origins. After amassing considerable wealth selling land in the 1870s and 1880s, McClellan died in an elevator accident in 1899. His death left open the question of who would inherit his money and property. Three groups of claimants came before the local courts with the belief that John McClellan was, in some way, their relative. After eighteen years of litigation, none of the claimant parties could prove that the man who died in Sioux Falls was their relative by the name John McClellan. As a result, the courts escheated McClellans estate to the state of South Dakota. Given the evidence presented by the claimants, the question remains as to whether or not this was the correct decision. By utilizing the archived materials from the McClellan estate trial, the two Sioux Falls newspapers of the day, and various other documents from throughout the United States, it was possible to thoroughly reexamine the cases presented by all three of the trials claimant parties. The research material showed that each claimant had a relative named John McClellan, and all of their documented family stories seemed to fit the pattern of the Sioux Falls mans life. However, there were no solid means by which any of the three parties could prove that their relative was the same man who died in Sioux Falls in 1899. By recreating the story of John McClellans life from numerous archival materials, and by reexamining the evidence brought forward during the estate trial, it is clear that the state of South Dakota was correct in its ruling that John McClellan died intestate. Ultimately, each claimant was mistaken in the identity of the John McClellan in Sioux Falls. This is the first time the story of John McClellans life, as well as the estate trial following his death, has been told in detail.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04212008-153702/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AUGUST STREAM DISCHARGE TRENDS PORTEND IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE NORTHERN ROCKIES</field><field name="creator">Leppi, Jason Christopher</field><field name="description">This thesis is composed of two potential professional papers written to be independent of each other. Both papers were written to explore changes in late summer discharge patterns across the Northern Rockies (NR). Water in the interior western United States is a vital resource and the demand for this resource has increased. Watersheds in the NR are mainly snowmelt dominated in that they depend on the seasonal flux of snow-melt during dry periods. During the summer months August is a critical time for aquatic ecosystems due to typical low discharge and warm air temperatures. During this period water temperatures can become elevated stressing aquatic biota. The first chapter addresses historic August discharge trends across the NR and examines the frequency of low discharge over time. Using historic discharge data from United States Geologic Surveys national water information system web interface, we analyzed data for trends of 40-59 years. Combining these records with aerial photos (&lt;10m resolution) and water rights records we selected gaging sites based on the length and continuity of discharge records and categorized each site based on the amount of diversion and location of water storage devices. Local significance was examined using the Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and regional significance was obtained using a bootstrap procedure in combination with the Mann-Kendall test. Our analyses indicate that watersheds throughout the NR are experiencing substantial declines in stream discharge and we have found that 75% of all stations exhibit a declining slope. Bootstrap analysis indicates that the NR is experiencing a significant (&#225; = 0.10) decline in discharge from 1951-2008. The second chapter takes a subset of the original 153 sites, deemed pristine sites, and examined the relationship of August discharge to climatic parameters for each watershed. By using stations with no identifiable diversion and minimal land use change we were able to analyze precipitation and air temperature records for correlations with discharge trends. Bootstrap methods were used to determine field significance of the region. Long term discharge analyses demonstrate that eight of the fifteen watersheds throughout the NR are experiencing significant declines in stream discharge over the last half century and all stations have a negative slope. Additionally, the region as a whole appears to have a significant decrease in discharge over the period 1951-2008. Correlations results show a weak to moderate negative relationship between air temperatures and discharge and these results coupled with increasing air temperature trends pose serious concern for aquatic ecosystems in NR.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest Management</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04232010-122502/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Demographic and Landscape Analysis for Common Loons in Northwest Montana</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Christopher Allan Moanikeala</field><field name="description">Understanding the relationship between a species important vital rates and how they respond to environmental factors is essential for developing appropriate conservation strategies. Historically, breeding populations of common loons existed across much of the northwestern United States, but that area of distribution within the lower 48 states has been significantly reduced. Montana still has the largest breeding population of common loons in the western continental United States, averaging 40-70 territorial pairs annually. Most research to date on loon population dynamics, habitat use, and response to disturbance was conducted in much larger populations of the Midwest and Northeast United States and did not account for individual vital rate importance. Recent sensitivity analysis showed that fecundity was the vital rate had the most influence on the population growth rate in common loons. Therefore, I designed my research to evaluate the relationships between disturbance (as measured by the number of houses, resorts, and campgrounds in relation to lake size), habitat, intraspecific interactions and territory occupancy and reproduction. I used occupancy models to explore the dynamics underlying occupancy of potential lakes. I observed that landscape scale effects were important to occupancy of loon territories. The abundance of feeding lakes and the number of territorial pairs within 10 km were equally important for explaining probabilities of occupancy. I suggest managers protect both occupied, as well as, unoccupied lakes, especially when in close proximity to clusters of territorial pairs and feeding lakes. I observed that lake scale effects were more important to reproductive potential than landscape scale effects. I found a significant negative relationship with islands and a significant positive relationship with shoreline complexity on reproduction. Shoreline disturbance did not appear important when compared to other factors, but there are factors associated with Montanas outreach and education program that probably affected this result. For increasing reproduction I suggest managers continue current management activities, but include a greater focus on protecting nesting habitat on lakes without islands. I also suggest managers continue to mitigate for disturbance while exploring other ways to evaluate the effects of disturbance on occupancy and reproduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04242008-130448/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AGRICULTURAL CERTIFICATIONS AND BEEKEEPING: LESSONS FROM AN APICULTURAL COOPERATIVE IN NORTHEASTERN EL SALVADOR, CENTRAL AMERICA</field><field name="creator">Seagle, Jason Andrew</field><field name="description">Beekeeping, and especially the production and sale of honey, is an on-farm diversification strategy that has significance to rural livelihoods in some of the most economically and environmentally marginalized regions of the world.

The benefits of citizen science include saving the agency or organization resources, educating the community about conservation issues, and promoting land stewardship. Currently, many citizen monitoring organizations are based in urban areas, whereas their projects are located near more rural towns. Research shows that demographics such as area of residence can be a factor in the publics attitude toward any scientific or land management project (Williams et al, 2002; Kellert, 1978, 1985; Vaske et al, 2001). This fact was supported by a citizen science project, led by the author, on the Clearwater National Forest. Currently, no citizen science organizing manuals address the issue of rural/urban difference in volunteer recruitment. Additionally, the question of what qualities citizen science must have to be used by government agencies must be determined so that non-governmental organizations can produce useful data. I interviewed 11 successful urban-based citizen science conservation organizations in order to establish the characteristics of successful volunteer recruitment and retention. Additionally, I interviewed five state or federal agencies that used citizen science data in order to establish the characteristics of effective citizen science programs. Using Glesne (1999) as a guide, interviews were numbered and coded. Results showed that successful recruitment methods differ between rural and urban areas, with word of mouth and local newspapers as most effective. Citizens must believe in the program, have a social atmosphere associated with the program, and have a personal relationship with the project organizer in order to volunteer again. There is a difference in rural and urban communities, having to do with different values, priorities, and environmental awareness. Effective citizen science programs share three main characteristics: a proper training program, scientific accuracy, and a quality control program.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04252007-134546/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Letters from Mrs. Chenowith and other stories</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Jill M</field><field name="description">None</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04262007-150435/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guide to Implementing a Middle School Activity Program</field><field name="creator">Balis, Laura Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of the guide is to describe the steps in designing, implementing, and evaluating a cardiovascular health program for middle school students, called CATCH Fridays, and to create a guide for others who wish to replicate the program at their school.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04272009-094021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HUMAN PREDATION RISK AND ELK BEHAVIOR IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES</field><field name="creator">Cleveland, Shawn M.</field><field name="description">Elk (Cervus elaphus) are increasing in fragmented landscapes that result from exurban human development throughout western North America.

However, little was known about the indirect effect hunting has on anti-predator behavior, movement, resource selection, and human-elk conflicts. We first investigated the indirect effects of hunting on elk using an extensive comparison of elk anti-predator behavior across four human predation risk levels in western Montana. We collected 361behavioral observations across this predation risk gradient from October 2008 to March 2009. Vigilance was highest in highest predation risk areas and lowest in lowest risk areas. Vigilance and movement attenuated with the removal of human predation risk within 3-5 weeks under intermediate human predation risk in Missoula, Montana. I then used an intensive investigation of elk outfitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars in the WUI of Missoula to test the indirect effects of hunting on elk. We used data from nine GPS collared adult female elk during three hunting seasons with increasing hunting pressure (2007-2009) to test relationships between movement rates measured by first passage time (FPT) and resource selection. FPT decreased annually, by season type, and by hunting mode (archery vs rifle), and was negatively correlated with hunter predation risk. Elk slowed down ~750 meters from and selected for areas ~1200 meters from houses and trails, suggesting habituation to humans contributed to WUI human-wildlife conflict. These results support the risk allocation hypothesis that elk modify behavior in relation to temporal and spatial variation in human predation risk, and provide some of the first insights as to the indirect effects of hunting on elk in the WUI.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04282010-103245/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RIDING THE CLUTCH</field><field name="creator">Shackelford, Marvin Lee</field><field name="description">A collection of short stories.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04292009-121809/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does nest size constrain clutch size? A tropical-temperate test</field><field name="creator">Biancucci, Atilio Luis</field><field name="description">The smaller clutch size of tropical as opposed to north temperate birds has intrigued researchers for a long time. An untested hypothesis posits that higher nest predation in the tropics favors smaller nests thereby constraining clutch-size. We tested this hypothesis by conducting an experiment to test whether nest predation increases with nest size in a tropical forest. Furthermore, we studied north temperate and tropical birds to examine if: (1) predation rates increased with nest size, (2) nest sizes were smaller in the tropics, and (3) clutch size was explained by nest size controlled for body size. We used data on predation rates, nest sizes, and clutch sizes for &gt; 2000 north temperate and tropical bird nests of 36 altricial bird species that nest in open cups. Nest predation risk increased with nest size in both the experiment and in the comparison across latitudes, justifying a major premise underlying the nest size hypothesis. However, nest sizes were not smaller in the tropics. As a result, clutch sizes were not related to nest sizes either between latitudes or within sites. Nest sizes were strongly correlated with adult body sizes. Hence, (1) body size might influence reproductive success by affecting nest predation through nest size; and (2) we rejected the hypothesis that nest size explains clutch size in the tropics.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04292009-160802/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FEMALE COMPETITION AND THE ROLE OF TESTOSTERONE IN A POLYGYNOUS SYSTEM</field><field name="creator">Ekernas, Lars Stefan</field><field name="description">Testosterone plays an important role in male competitive ability, and it may play a similar function in females. Female-female competition for resources is often associated with high testosterone, both within females and in comparison to males. Positive associations between testosterone and competition are most likely to be seen in systems with high female-female competition. Resource defense polygyny may be one such system since females congregate on high-quality nutrient sources, leading to substantial opportunities for interference competition. I studied female Grants gazelle (Nanger granti), a classic resource defense polygynous species, to investigate female competition and its relationship to testosterone. I found substantial evidence for competition between females. Females frequently engaged in agonistic behavior, on average initiating over two agonistic bouts per hour, and higher-ranking females initiated more agonism than lower-ranking females. Testosterone appeared to play an important role in competitive ability. Immunoreactive fecal testosterone metabolites (fT) were strongly positively correlated to both dominance rank and number of agonistic bouts initiated per hour, but only agonism was associated with fT when dominance and agonism were accounted for simultaneously. Females had similar fT concentrations as males. fT was positively associated with immunoreactive fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM), and this relationship was not due to associations between dominance and fGCM. Month also influenced testosterone physiology. Females had lower fT during a drought than after rains had begun. In addition, fT increased more from August to November in high-ranking females than in low-ranking females. My results suggest that female-female competition may be substantial in resource defense polygynous systems. Testosterone might play an important role in mediating competitive ability in females, but it was also associated with higher glucocorticoid secretion. Future studies on females would be well served to investigate the consequences of testosterone secretion and how they relate to female competition.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-04302010-190034/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Confinement in a Strange Hour</field><field name="creator">Burke, Trina</field><field name="description">A collection of verse and prose poetry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05022008-091642/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE USE OF TOOTH PIT AND TOOTH/JAW MEASUREMENTS TO IDENTIFY CARNIVORE TAXA RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE ON SCAVENGED BONE</field><field name="creator">Foust, Jennifer L.</field><field name="description">Forensic anthropologists are often asked to analyze and interpret human remains that have been modified or damaged by predators and/or scavengers (White 2000; James et al. 2005; Dupras et al. 2006). The goal of this study is to determine whether it is possible to distinguish carnivore tooth mark characteristics from other carnivore tooth mark characteristics through two separate analyses: first by examination of tooth pitting and second from carnivore tooth and jaw measurements. This is accomplished by visual analysis and measurements of tooth pits left on faunal bones processed by an experimental wolf group as well as carnivore tooth and jaw measurements from a study done by Murmann et al. (2006) and measurements done by the author from samples located in the Philip L. Wright Zoological Museum. In the first analysis, independent t-tests demonstrate that pit lengths found on long bone epiphyses that are less than 4mm are likely to be made by carnivores the same size or smaller than a jackal. If pit lengths found on long bone epiphyses are between 4mm and 6mm, they are likely to have been made by carnivores roughly the same size as baboons, bears, dogs, and wolves and if the pit lengths found on long bone epiphyses measure greater than 6mm, they are likely made by carnivores about the same size as hyenas and lions. Pit breadths between 2mm and 4mm found on long bone epiphyses are associated with carnivores in the size bracket of baboons, jackals, bears and dogs. Pit breadths larger than 4mm found on long bone epiphyses are associated with larger carnivores such as hyenas, lions and wolves. The second analysis, a discriminant function analysis using tooth and jaw measurements distinguishes carnivore tooth mark characteristics from other carnivore tooth mark characteristics left on scavenged remains through the use of the Murmann et al. (2006) measurements with an accuracy of between 75.5% based on leave one out cross-validation and 78.3% based on the accuracy of classification of a test sample.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05032010-182611/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building a Better Local Food System: A Case Study of the Western Montana Growers Cooperative</field><field name="creator">Neely, Beth Anne</field><field name="description">Local food systems aiming to re-create direct links between producers and consumers are emerging in the United States and elsewhere in response to the social, economic, and environmental consequences of the globalizing food market. Despite growing consumer demand for locally produced food, small-scale producers may not have the capacity to meet the needs of wholesale food purchasers, such as restaurants, grocery stores, schools, or hospitals, thus limiting their markets to direct sales to consumers. Wholesale customers, in turn, face a number of barriers to purchasing local food. Producer cooperatives may alleviate some of the challenges faced by wholesale buyers while opening new markets for their members. Previous studies have examined the perspectives of wholesale food buyers that may or may not purchase locally. This study explores the perspectives of wholesale buyers at grocery stores and restaurants who purchase from one producer cooperative in particular, the Western Montana Growers Cooperative. This research investigates the extent to which the Western Montana Growers Cooperative helps its wholesale customers overcome the barriers to purchasing local food, and offers suggestions for the Western Montana Growers Cooperative to continue building a vibrant local food system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05042007-113512/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stare Meal</field><field name="creator">White, Laurie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Poetry manuscript</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05052008-131324/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traps: Stories and a One-Act Play</field><field name="creator">Blanks, James</field><field name="description">A collection of five short stories and a one-act play.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05052008-150953/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First, Plant Your Feet</field><field name="creator">Jones, Peter Francis</field><field name="description">Short story collection</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05062007-171407/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Shame, Guilt and Society's Conception of Sex</field><field name="creator">Magsig, Hailey M.</field><field name="description">There is a dominant conception of sex in American society that has profound effects on our sexual lives. Often this can be a negative influence because our societys conception is distorted. My thesis considers how this skewed view on sex and sexuality results in the presence of shame and guilt in our sexual lives. I first define societys conception of sex and present it visually through fashion advertising. Each of the pornographic elements (objectification, submission, hierarchy and violence) utilized in advertising are explained. The advertisements are meant to provide a visual portrayal of societys conception of sex, which is relevant to the concept of the gaze; an important aspect of shame. Second, I provide a philosophical account of shame and guilt. I illustrate how our societys conception of sex can instigate these emotions into our sexual lives even though they are often unfounded. Finally, I attempt to resolve the invalid shame and baseless guilt we experience in our sexual lives through the notion of sexual self-respect, which is a variant of the philosophical concept of self-respect. As individuals we have some influence in diminishing the invalid shame and baseless guilt we experience in our sexual lives. However, society has a responsibility to formulate a conception of sex that is more conducive to our actual lived sexual experiences. Therefore, the solution resides in the give and take relationships between the individual and society, between self-respect and respect and between society and the media. I present these changes in societys conception of sex as the possibility of seeing advertising that utilizes erotic elements rather than pornographic elements, and the use of models that more accurately portray us as sexual beings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05062008-144818/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Possible Boats</field><field name="creator">Pataky, Jeremy</field><field name="description">NA</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05072007-223912/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex-specific investment in incubation and the reproductive biology of two tropical antbird species</field><field name="creator">Schwartz, Brian A</field><field name="description">Paternal care has been neglected in behavioral studies because it is rare among most animals. Birds express wide variation in male care across a broad life-history gradient, but such variation among species remains poorly explored. At the same time, contributions of male assistance with incubation have been largely overlooked with the assumption that incubation is a time of low parental energy expenditure. We compared male versus female biparental incubation effort between two tropical antbird species in the northern Andes of Venezuela. We found that males and females apportion reproductive effort differently between these two species, but that male contributions of time and incubation effort were generally greater than for north temperate species which exhibit different life-history strategies. Males spent an equal or greater amount of time incubating, yet maintained lower egg temperatures than females during different age-specific stages of the incubation period. Despite sex differences in incubation temperatures, males rewarmed cold clutches at similar rates to females suggesting similar sex-specific physiological incubation abilities. For the first time in a nidicolous species, we found that temperatures experienced by developing embryos increased with age of eggs independent of male and female time spent on the nest. Our results suggest that males may benefit embryo development by minimizing time eggs experience cold temperatures during female absences, and concurrently benefit female physiological condition for future nesting efforts. Lastly, we report standardized measures of reproductive traits in these two endemic tropical species in hope of improving data collection efforts outside of North America. Standardized measures of reproductive traits are essential for improving our understanding of reproductive biology and avian life-history evolution among different regions of the world. The Tropical Andes are among one of the most species-rich areas in the world and represent an area of critical conservation concern. Yet, for many endemic taxa inhabiting this region even basic descriptions of reproductive traits are entirely absent. This study extends the range of variation in reproductive strategies among a broader range of species among geographical regions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05072008-151032/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using 3-D Geometric Morphometric Techniques to Further Understand the Relationship Between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens</field><field name="creator">Minetz, Jolen Anya</field><field name="description">The relationship between hominids in the middle and late Pleistocene has been a heated subject of debate since Neanderthals were first recognized. Neanderthals are either a distinctly separate species from Homo sapiens that were replaced by Homo sapiens without any genetic interaction, which supports the taxonomical title for Neanderthals as Homo neanderthalensis, or there was at least a minimal genetic interaction between contemporaneous Neanderthals and early humans, designating Neanderthals as a subspecies with a taxonomic title of Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. The purpose of this research was to further explore this issue by conducting a quantitative analysis on several aspects of morphological variation evident in crania of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. Cranial landmarks were digitized on the cranial vault (cranial vault analysis) and midfacial area (alpha triangulation analysis) of the specimens. Digitizing cranial landmarks preserves the information inherent in those landmarks relative to other landmarks in three dimensions. The data was fitted using generalized procrustes analysis, a geometric morphometric technique that is a statistically powerful mathematical superimposition method that essentially eliminates size as a variable, while preserving the variables present in shapes. This method breaks down complexities inherent in three dimensional data and allows the landmark data collected by the digitizer to be compatible with statistical analyses. The fitted data was then analyzed using multivariate statistical methods that included principal component analysis and canonical variates analysis. The results of the cranial vault analysis distinguished Neanderthals from both modern humans as well as early modern humans. The alpha triangulation analysis produced relatively ambiguous results. In the discriminant analysis of the cranial vault data set, several individual specimens were misclassified into the Neanderthal group through resubstitution and cross-validation using linear discriminant functions. It is clear that these individual specimens have a unique morphology compared to their associated groups, and that they are closer in morphology to Neanderthals than their associated group means. The morphological degree of variation cannot conclusively define the taxonomic position of Neanderthals because morphologically based research is limited to explaining the differences and similarities inherent in forms, but cannot accurately define a species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05072008-170758/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sins I Saw</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Kimberly</field><field name="description">Short stories, creative nonfiction, novel chapter</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05082007-125511/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small Robe Band of Blackfeet: Ethnogenesis by Social and Religious Transformation</field><field name="creator">Juneau, Linda Matt</field><field name="description">One of the most significant challenges facing Native Americans and their indigenous identity is a greater understanding of the historical complexity of relationships that interconnected ethnically diverse populations across geographic landscapes. This thesis examines the range of Blackfoot political, social, economic structures, spiritual beliefs, and practices that were in place at the time of Euro-American contact. I use historically documented evidence of transformations that took place from the beginning of the fur trade era through the reservation era. Through the theoretical lens of ethnogenesis I use a case study of the Small Robe (Inucksiks) band of the South Piegan of Montana to elucidate their responses to conditions of change. I conclude that all divisions of the Blackfoot Confederacy changed in response to catastrophic conditions of disease, warfare, other natural phenomena.

The data set allows for an expansion of the types of strain and delinquency typically examined in strain tests. Ordinary least squares regression, path analysis and a series of t-tests were used to determine variations in male and female emotional and behavioral responses to strain. The results of this analysis suggest that certain types of strain influence which type of delinquency males and females will pursue and that the intervening effect of negative emotion are consequential for both genders.

In brown water rivers of Western Kamchatka, the foodweb is dominated by ubiquitous benthic amphipods (Anisogammarus kygi) that consume salmon carcass material. We hypothesized that A. kygi are a strong interactor in the feedback loop which links dead spawner biomass to juvenile salmonid growth. We found that A. kygi had a complex life cycle with anadromous and resident forms. A. kygi dominated the macro-benthos, comprising more than 88.0% (SE=.01, N=7) of invertebrate biomass, and were highly mobile within the system, exhibiting upstream migrations of ovigerous females (23 ind/m3 &#177; 5), drift of juveniles, and re-distribution during carcass loading. A. kygi was observed feeding on 97% of salmon carcasses examined (N=100), making up 98.8% (SE .007) of invertebrate consumers, at densities up to 3,000 carcass-1. Amphipods were an important food item for rearing salmonids, especially during the summer when fish diets reached a peak of 88.7% (SE=6.0%) amphipods in 2005, and 68% (SE=18%) amphipods in 2006. The condition factor of salmonid juveniles (K) increased from spring to summer, particularly in juvenile chum, whose spring diet was 76.83% (SE 0.05) amphipods, corroborating the importance of an amphipod based diet for salmonids in this river. We concluded that A .kygi is a strong interactor in the Utkholok system. We also observed abundance of A. kygi in six other brown water rivers of western Kamchatka which suggests that the amphipod-mediated feedback of marine derived nutrients described for the Utkholok, is typical of brown water systems with salmon.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organismal Biology and Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05092007-145457/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mirror of Nature: Chesapeake Perceptions of Wilderness, 1650-1787</field><field name="creator">Green, Katie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This paper examines attitudes toward wilderness in the Chesapeake from 1650 to 1787.

Because many of these systems are mission-critical, it is of utmost importance to determine their input and output constraints. Determining input constraints is a trivial matter, but the constraint determination of a system's output values is a serious and challenging problem that historically has entailed an exhaustive exploration of the system's input states. The work presented in this thesis recounts and extends a research project supported by NASA whose focus was to develop a strategy to constrain the outputs of a Simulink model. Simulink models are quite similar to mathematical functions and therefore optimization algorithms can be applied to constrain the outputs. Optimizations of simple mathematical functions paved the way for random functions and finally led to the development of two optimization algorithms. During the exploration of potential optimization algorithms, strategies such as Monte Carlo, the simplex method, simulated annealing, and evolution strategy were explored. In the end, a combined approach utilizing both simulated annealing and the simplex method was compared with evolution strategy for relative strengths and weaknesses. It was determined that the evolution strategy algorithm was more suited to optimization of Simulink models due to its more effective usage of model calls and to its higher success rate.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05112007-121748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Why Take the Risk?: Women's Interpretive Repertoires for Choosing Home Birth</field><field name="creator">St. Clair, Laura Ann</field><field name="description">The purpose of this project was to use a social constructivist approach to understand the perception of risk by mothers making the choice to give birth at home in Missoula, Montana. Social constructivism assumes that knowledge about risk is filtered through social and cultural frameworks of understanding (Lupton and Tulloch 2002, 321). The information gained from participants in this study was interpreted as a representation of the individuals culture, including their beliefs, values and upbringing, as well as the influences of the individuals social network which can include family members, spouses, friends, and community members. Various phenomena, elements or constructs in society are viewed as realities by social groups whether they exist as reality or not. Social constructs in the United States create a reality around the normalcy of hospital birth and tend to paint a picture of home birth mothers as risk takers (Craven 2005) (Davis-Floyd 1992). However, in developing this study, I predicted that home birth mothers would construct a different type of reality around risk in order to explain their decision to have a home birth. By examining the interpretive repertoires of home birth mothers in Missoula, Montana, one can begin to understand how women interpret their individual risk concerning birth and respond according to their determined level of vulnerability. First, the mothers confronted the dominant social norm that home birth is risky. In response to accusations of making a risky decision, these home birth mothers responded by emphasizing the risks that they see in hospital birth. For home birth mothers, the importance of having minimal medical interventions during the birth of their baby outweighed other potential risks associated with homebirth identified by medical authorities or published studies. Furthermore, many of the women in this study emphasized feeling very positively about their home birth experiences and felt that going through with this decision helped them gain feelings of confidence and empowerment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05112008-130518/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Debris: stories</field><field name="creator">Ekkizogloy, Nick E</field><field name="description">Debris: stories, focuses on families and people who are outsiders in a small town in the south.

Devastated by the depredations of nineteenth century woodsmen, the populations of these large mammals rebounded during the twentieth century. Numbering fewer than ten in 1895, the Adirondacks remnant beaver population recolonized the regions lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers over the next twenty-five years, assisted by the presence of prime habitat, a state-enforced moratorium on beaver trapping, and timely reinforcements. Hunters shot the last of the Adirondacks moose near Raquette Lake in 1861. Moose began returning naturally to the region during the second half of the twentieth century, dispersing into the Adirondack Highlands from the resurgent woodlands of Vermont. More than four hundred now inhabit northern New York. While the Adirondacks wolves outlasted the regions moose, bounty-hunters had successfully eliminated canine predators by the early 1890s. But in the next four decades rapidly expanding coyote populations hybridized with wolves as they extended their range eastward around the Great Lakes. Capable of traveling through regions largely impermeable to wolves, coyote hybrids served as hardy vessels of wolf genetic material, interjecting wolf DNA from Canada back into the Adirondack Highlands. The entry and continued evolution of wolf-coyote hybrids within the Adirondack ecosystem thus represents a genetic, if not a physical, restoration. These unique restoration histories together illustrate the considerable resilience of the Adirondack ecosystem and its large mammal species, while providing valuable context for future rewilding efforts within the Northeastern woodlands.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05122008-125833/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Social Benefits of Wilderness</field><field name="creator">Aloi, Michael Joseph</field><field name="description">Modern culture has not yet learned to live in harmony with the rest of the natural world. This is largely because we are afflicted with inadequate institutions and personal habits. These habits and institutions are also responsible for many social ills sexism, homophobia, etc. In particular, the imperium is a way of thinking and acting which encourages us to practice a heavy-handed form of standardization; it encourages us to ignore particularity. These habits and institutions the imperium are a result of, and reinforced by, our interpersonal interactions. The standardization of these interactions drains the wildness out of them. But to relate to an other in an ethical manner, I must assume that the other is wild, with its own integrity, will, and path. Because our experiences in wilderness are radically different than our experiences outside wilderness, the wilderness can instill in us different, better habits and understanding of relationships. In particular, the wildness of wilderness shows us the falseness of the standardized ideas and beliefs. This wildness also causes us to forge new habits of relating to others, and new beliefs about relationships and others. These new habits are social benefits, especially once we allow them to reform our identity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05122009-110525/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scale dependent genetic structure of Idaho Giant salamanders (Dicamptodon aterrimus) in stream networks</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Lindy Beth</field><field name="description">Stream network structure constrains population processes of freshwater organisms, with individual, population and community level consequences. This consistent structure provides a framework in which examination of life-history influences on population genetic structure may provide general insight. I examined how stream network structure affects gene flow and genetic structure of the facultatively paedomorphic Idaho Giant salamander, Dicamptodon aterrimus in Idaho and Montana, USA. I used microsatellite data to test population structure models by (i) examining hierarchical partitioning of genetic variation in stream networks and (ii) testing for genetic isolation by distance along stream corridors versus overland pathways. Replicated sampling of streams within catchments within three river basins revealed that stream hierarchical scales had strong effects on gene flow and genetic structure. AMOVA identified significant structure among all hierarchical levels (among streams, among catchments, among basins), and divergence among catchments had the greatest structural influence. Isolation by distance was detected within catchments, and in-stream distance was a strong predictor of genetic divergence. Patterns of genetic divergence suggest that differentiation among streams within catchments was driven by limited migration according to the stream hierarchy model, but divergence among catchments and among basins was due to genetic drift, consistent with the death valley model of population structure (Meffe and Vrijenhoek 1988). These results show the strong influence of stream networks on population structure and genetic divergence of a salamander with contrasting effects at different hierarchical scales.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05122009-185513/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA CASE 29</field><field name="creator">Munch, Jennifer Claire</field><field name="description">In this professional paper I examine the human skeletal remains of one individual.

The objective of my project was to embrace an art form with which I had very limited experience and a media, clay, with which I had very little control. I had to gain skills that would allow me to help my primary school students consistently produce objects of which they could be proud. I made hundreds of pots with children this year. I helped my students form their pots by using my hands with their hands, and I learned a lot about fire and what it takes to change. The big electric kiln had sat in a corner of our art room for years and I was afraid to turn on the power. Working through the project this year I overcame that fear. As a result of this project I am confident we can make ceramic art at our school.

In the past two years alone, the United States Congress has appropriated $90 million for road removal and watershed restoration. Despite this relatively large public investment, little is known about the efficacy or ecological effects of road-removal practices. One particularly important issue is the impact of post-road-removal revegetation strategies. This study evaluated 1) short-term effects of road decommissioning on plant community composition, 2) effects of seed-mix seed origin (native vs. nonnative), species diversity, and seeding density on vegetative establishment, and 3) impact of overstory canopy and coarse woody debris on revegetation success on recently decommissioned roads. Total vegetative cover declined by 60% one-year after decommissioning, with nonnative plants showing the greatest declines (ca. 90%). Although managers often justify the use of nonnative seed mixes by the need for rapid establishment of plants on disturbed sites, we did not find significant differences in percent cover of total vegetation between plots seeded with native versus nonnative species, one year after treatment. Furthermore, cover of native species was significantly higher on plots seeded with natives compared to other treatment plots (12.3% vs. 7.8%, respectively). On treatments seeded with nonnative species, 18% of total vegetative cover was due to cover of seeded species; in comparison, seeded species accounted for 43% of total vegetative cover on native treatments. These findings suggest that native seed mixes actually may outperform nonnative ones in terms of vegetative establishment after disturbance associated with road removal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05132009-123906/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moments of Being: Beauty in Virginia Woolf's Works</field><field name="creator">Meusel, Kyndra Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore how Virginia Woolf depicts beauty in the literary scenes, characters, and language in her fictional works. In The Voyage Out (1915), Woolf writes, When one gave up seeing the beauty that clothed things, this was the skeleton beneath (12). In this passage, Woolf is defining one aspect of beauty. Beauty can disguise and is transient. This thesis explores beauty as a meditation on time, loss, and recovery of the past in memory and in vision (grounded in creative memory). All of these meditations are dependent on characters moments of being, or their awareness of being human. My findings are based on discussions of To the Lighthouse (1927), Jacobs Room (1922), Mrs. Dalloway (1925), and Between the Acts (1941).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05132010-012807/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To Save the World: The Untold Stories of Memorial Row</field><field name="creator">Webster, Michael Dean</field><field name="description">On Arbor Day, 1919, 32 Ponderosa Pine trees were planted on the campus of the University of Montana to commemorate individuals associated with the university who died while serving Montana in World War I.

Therapist as catalyst of functional activity proves to be the preferred identity of occupational therapists and the subsequent identities work to support or interfere with occupational therapists ability to see themselves as a catalyst of functional activity for their patients.

In this study, ten stakeholders in the issue of contaminants in traditional foods in Alaska were interviewed to determine how they define the problem, and in doing so, to determine if they perceive that the situation constitutes an environmental injustice for Alaska Natives. The interview transcripts were analyzed using five sub-frames of the environmental justice framework: distributive justice, procedural justice, indigenous rights, corrective justice, and ecological sustainability. The interview responses suggest that, viewed through five sub-frames of environmental justice (EJ), Alaska Natives do face an environmental injustice. In particular, Alaska Natives face disparate cultural impacts at the hands of contaminants and lack adequate opportunities for procedural involvement. The findings presented in this paper point to three solutions to the problem: 1) Establish a U.S. Arctic Contaminants Program to collaboratively study the situation in Alaska and to provide education to impacted populations, 2) Enact new comprehensive, enforceable, precautionary U.S. laws that govern and regulate chemicals, and 3) Extend global policies that phase out chemicals and support ecologically sustainable practices. Additionally, this professional paper, done to help support the work of the Alaska Community Action on Toxics (ACAT), offers suggestions for strategies that ACAT can use in their activism. These strategies consider how to best use the various EJ frames to effectively communicate with stakeholders (other activist groups and government entities) about the problems and solutions for dealing with the threat that contaminants in traditional foods pose to Alaska Natives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05142007-071823/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bishopness</field><field name="creator">Slaughter, Lauren Goodwin</field><field name="description">The publication of "Edgar Allen Poe &amp; the Juke-Box" modifies Elizabeth Bishops established oeuvre in ways that demonstrate the anxiety throughout her work regarding the concealment of sexual differencea concealment she often takes part in.

However, within the past two and a half decades a significant number of historical, academic, sociological, and literary inquiries and works have uncovered this once forgotten past. Because of these investigations, the anti-homosexual actions inflicted upon gay men by the Third Reich have the ability to impact the continual creation of a queer collective memory and consciousness. Unfortunately, many queers do not know the historic connotations and denotation of the pink trianglea symbol worn by homosexual males within the concentration campsnow so readily used by the queer community today as a representation of pride. By analyzing the history, testimonies, fictional account of gay persecution, and attempts of reestablishment in the usage of the pink triangle, this thesis seeks to establish the history of persecution of gay men as a solidifying piece of the queer collective consciousness. Such a collective consciousness will not only remember and commemorate those gay lives lost during the Holocaust, but it will also allow the queer community to have a viable political and social past and future that will allow such atrocities to occur never again.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05142008-150238/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One Last Chance</field><field name="creator">Kautz, Michael Quist</field><field name="description">Non-fiction essays</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05142009-140527/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foxgloves</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Molly Gartland</field><field name="description">This series of poems revolves around grief and impermanence.

Such nutrient-rich inputs can degrade aquatic ecosystems by accelerating eutrophication events, especially in summer months when surface water flows are low. Alternative treatment practices, modeled after natural ecosystem processes, could reduce nutrient inputs to surface waters while accumulating biomass and sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide. I designed and implemented an alternative treatment strategy, using effluent to fertilize trees at the Missoula Wastewater Treatment Facility. The objectives of this work were to assess: 1) environmental impacts of effluent application; 2) tree survivorship; and 3) growth effects. A two acre plantation was established in May 2009 by planting 316 dormant, unrooted stem cuttings of two hybrid poplar species, Populus deltoides X Populus trichocarpa and Populus deltoides X Populus nigra, and the native Black Cottonwood, Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa. The effects of effluent fertilization on poplar growth, soil and ground water nutrient contents were monitored throughout the first growing season of this pilot project. Effluent fertilization nearly doubled poplar growth, and as suspected, had no major impacts on soil or ground water nutrient concentrations. Continued research at this site is necessary to observe environmental impacts as effluent loading rates increase. Our initial results suggest that surface application of wastewater effluent offers a valuable strategy for decreasing effluent input rates to the Clark Fork River. Moreover, this project offers smaller communities a "blue print" from which to design similar projects that remediate nutrient-rich effluent in a cost-effective way.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05142010-135901/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Borehole Measurements of Dynamic Basal Drainage Adjustments During Sliding Accelerations: Bench Glacier, Alaska</field><field name="creator">Meierbachtol, Toby Warren</field><field name="description">Artificial perturbations of borehole water levels, or slug tests, are a commonly employed means of characterizing the glacier hydrologic system. Results documenting the influence of slug testing on a field of boreholes and its change with time, however, are scarce. Slug tests were performed on Bench Glacier, AK in 21 boreholes over three field seasons during an annual late spring glacier speed up event. Fifty four slug tests were conducted, with water level monitoring in up to five boreholes adjacent to the slugged borehole. Seven of the slug tests were performed in conjunction with dye dispersion tests to identify water pathways within the slugged borehole following perturbation. Underdamped and overdamped slug test responses show a high degree of connectivity among boreholes connected via the glacier bed. The nature and degree of connectivity is temporally variable, suggesting that the drainage network at the bed is highly dynamic on time and space scales of hours and 10s of meters, respectively. The changes we document in slug test responses over time and space can be used to constrain explanations for the cause of the underdamped response. Examination of the underdamped response necessitates an understanding of the process(es) acting as the spring to produce the oscillatory water level behavior. We propose that coherent air packages are a likely means of producing the compliance needed to generate the underdamped slug test response, and that these air packages may exist within the glacier at the tips of subglacially propagated fractures. Synthesis of slug testing with other methods of study, such as video observation and dye tracing, helps lend insight into the governing processes at the glacier bed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05152007-152644/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading Placelessness and Suburbanization in Richard Yates</field><field name="creator">Feder, Darcy Anne</field><field name="description">The themes of suburbanization and placelessness arise in many of Yates novels, exposing the continuing pattern of conformity at any price which accompanied the rapidly-changing era of post-World War II America. As suburbanization began to take its toll on the American landscape, a new, increasingly placeless environment started to emerge; endless subdivisions of identical houses, commercial strip developments, shopping centers, and movie plazas sprang up, places which not only looked alike, but felt alike. A cultural shift accompanied this changing environment, one which embraced a new domestic ideal of the suburban family, an image constantly reinforced through the media of the time. Yates characters, while on the surface conforming to this ideal, imagine breaking free from their mundane lifestyles, harboring visions of untapped greatness within themselves. Ultimately, however, they lack the autonomy or strength of character needed to accomplish this break. Having existed for so long in an empty, shallow environment providing possibilities only for commonplace and mediocre experiences, they must cling desperately to safety and security at any price.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05152007-185515/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultures in Residence: Intercultural Communication Competence for Residence Life Staff</field><field name="creator">Flaherty, Bridget Eileen</field><field name="description">Despite a recent plateau in the number of international students coming to the U.S., international students still make up a significant portion of the student body at institutes of higher education.

This paper concludes with an examination of the ethnogenesis of Metis, Cree and Chippewa, which was based upon patterns of merger between discrete multi-ethnic groups.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05162007-102956/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lotus-Eater</field><field name="creator">Lickenbrock, Gregory Lee</field><field name="description">No abstract required, as it is a professional paper.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172010-131214/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Skinny on Weight Watchers: A Critical Analysis of Weight Watcher's Use of Metaphors</field><field name="creator">Reynolds-Dyk, Ashlynn Laura</field><field name="description">Founded in 1961, with 1.5 million people from around the world attending meetings every week today, Weight Watchers has become a socially and economically significant weight loss organization with the potential to affect the lives of many people. With that in mind, this study describes and analyzes the rhetorical strategies of Weight Watchers. More specifically, this study depicts the metaphors used by Weight Watchers to describe its 2009 program, the Momentum Program. Which metaphors are used, how those metaphors function to create a reality for dieters, how those metaphors produce and filter meaning, and the actions those metaphors encourage and discourage are discussed. Additionally, the ways in which metaphors are embedded with Western cultures assumptions about obesity and weight loss is discussed. The implications of Weight Watchers use of metaphors to describe the Momentum program are discussed as a rhetorical device that reinforces notions of the docile body, mind/body duality, normalization of the ideal body, and the care of the self. Finally, the implications of the use of mixed or multiple metaphors are discussed as being neither contradictory nor complimentary.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172010-144028/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTREAM FLOW RIGHTS ON NATIONAL FOREST LANDS IN MONTANA</field><field name="creator">FISCHER, ANDREW MARIAS</field><field name="description">A unique opportunity exists to create instream water rights on national forest lands in Montana as a result of the US Forest Service Reserved Water Rights Compact between the US Forest Service (USFS) and the state of Montana, which went into law in 2007. Instream water rights on national forest lands are important because they have the potential to protect streamflows that support many vital ecosystem functions in our forests from water development pressures. Montana Trout Unlimited has an interest in advancing and accelerating this effort by providing stream recommendations to the USFS for the establishment of future water rights. The primary purposes of this paper are to offer recommendations to Montana Trout Unlimited for streams in Montana that would benefit the most from a US Forest Service instream water right and why, to develop an effective process for doing so, and to identify how Montana Trout Unlimited can help in this larger effort. Through the solicitation of stream recommendations from biologists and fisheries manager across the state and the development of a ranking worksheet to prioritize these recommendations, the final product of this research was a ranked stream list to help guide future efforts to establish USFS instream water rights. The USFS need to act on these recommendations and increase their investment in this effort before new water development pressures adjacent to national forests occur. Establishing water rights will enable the USFS to be a legal stakeholder in the water resources on national forest lands in Montana and ensure the long term health of our forests in the state.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05172010-171119/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reducing Dental Mercury Discharge in Missoula, Montana: Collaborative Opportunities</field><field name="creator">Silberberger, Jamie Elaine</field><field name="description">The purpose of this paper is to provide assistance in developing a program to control the release of dental mercury amalgam in Missoula, Montana.

Traditionally, the historiography of the American conservation movement and national parks presents the creation of Glacier and other preserved areas in a very triumphant tone. Histories of national parks often read as exultant tales, where enlightened conservationists and prescient administrators saved pristine landscapes of sublime beauty from misuse and destruction at the hands of greedy exploiters. However, these types of histories present an incomplete narrative concerning the creation of Glacier and other national parks. While Glacier was, and continues to be, a picturesque area of the country, the lands that now exist as Glacier National Park were never truly pristine or uninhabited. Native Americans have lived, hunted, and enjoyed this area of present-day Montana for thousands of years. Beginning in the late 19th century, white settlers and homesteaders began moving into the Glacier area, in search of viable farmland and attracted by the vast natural resources available in the region. Both the Blackfeet Indians, who lived in the eastern areas of the present-day park, and white settlers in the western lands of Glacier, relied on the bountiful timber, water, and game for survival. The effort to create Glacier National Park in 1910, an endeavor led by a small group of wealthy, Eastern conservationists, challenged and eventually ended the subsistence practices of these local residents. The history of the creation of Glacier National Park provides an opportunity to examine the issue of class conflict as it relates to the conservation movement and offers a valuable historical context for evaluating modern public lands debates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05182009-103256/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Homemade</field><field name="creator">Gann, Jennifer Nicole</field><field name="description">A short story collection about teenagers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05182009-123941/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Romanticism</field><field name="creator">Mingey, Kendall Anne</field><field name="description">No Abstract.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05192007-105728/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRAINING COMPARISON: 95%VO2PEAK vs. RACE PACE INTERVALS</field><field name="creator">Young, Laura</field><field name="description">INTRODUCTION: Interval training intensities are typically based on percentages of VO2max, heart rate max, or lactate threshold. Interval training based on current race pace has not been evaluated. PURPOSE: This study examined intervals at 95% VO2peak compared to race pace intervals on VO2peak, ventilatory threshold, time trial performance, peak power output, and vertical jump height in recreationally active subjects. METHODS: 34 subjects were randomly assigned to one of four training groups (TM-95%, Cycle-95%, TM-RP, Cycle-RP). Pre- and post- study, all subjects performed a ramped protocol test to exhaustion on a treadmill or electronically braked cycle ergometer for determination of VO2peak and ventilatory threshold and a 2.5 mile treadmill time trial or a 20 kilometer cycle time trial. The training intervention for the 95% groups was 4 x 4 minute intervals at 95% of VO2peak with 2 minute rest periods. The RP groups performed intervals with 2 minute rest periods at speeds 1% faster than their average time trial speed and increased 2% each week. All groups were matched for total work in ml/kg/min. Lab controlled interval sessions were three times per week for eight weeks. A-priori contrasts (1 tailed, dependent) were used to evaluate changes by interval type, mode of training, and gender. A two-way mixed design ANOVAs (time by group) were calculated to measure between group interactions (alpha p &lt; 0.05). Results are presented as mean &#177; standard error (SE). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between any of the four groups from pre to post in all dependent variables. However within groups, all subjects significantly improved in VO2peak, VT, time trial performance, and vertical jump height. No group was significantly able to increase peak power output. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that RP intervals were just as effective at improving VO2peak, ventilatory threshold, and time trial performance as 95%VO2peak intervals independent of gender and exercise mode. These data provide athletes with another option for training. Further research is needed to evaluate race pace intervals efficacy on physiological function, performance, and long term use.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05192008-133615/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biogenesis, Assembly and Intracellular Trafficking of Junin Arenavirus Envelope Glycoprotein Complex</field><field name="creator">Agnihothram, Sudhakar Srinivasarao</field><field name="description">An unusual feature in the arenavirus envelope glycoprotein complex (GP-C) is the presence of a myristoylated stable signal peptide (SSP) in addition to the receptor binding subunit G1 and the transmembrane fusion subunit G2. Genetic studies were employed to understand the structure-function of the GP-C complex, with emphasis on elucidating the role of SSP in arenavirus life cycle. We present genetic evidence that support the inclusion of G2 as a member of Class I viral fusion protein, where membrane fusion is mediated by six-helix bundle structure as in HIV and Influenza viruses. Furthermore, we have identified crucial roles for SSP in the GP-C complex. In the mature glycoprotein complex, SSP assumes a bitopic membrane topology with both its N and C termini in the cytosol, and a short ectodomain loop. This membrane orientation allows it to mask the endogenous endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signals in the cytoplasmic tail of G2 thereby allowing the transit of fully assembled GP-C complex through the Golgi to the cell surface. SSP also interacts with the ectodomain of G2 on the outer surface of the membrane. This interaction is critical in modulating the pH at which the membrane fusion is activated. The SSP-G2 pocket has been identified as the target of newly discovered small-molecule inhibitors of arenaviral entry. Beyond its role in intracellular trafficking and pH-dependent membrane fusion of GP-C complex, SSP might be involved in virus assembly and budding. Studies employing immunogold electron microscopy indicated that GP-C complex clusters into microdomains of 120 nm size independent of other viral proteins. Clustering of GP-C into membrane microdomains is neither influenced by SSP myristoylation nor by the co-expression of the matrix protein do Z. Regions of plasma membrane containing Z not co-localize with GP-C containing microdomains. Clustering of proteins or lipids on the plasma membrane may bring Z and GP-C together at the virus budding sites. Taken together, these data have contributed to the understanding of the unique subunit organization in GP-C complex and the mechanisms underlying efficient co-ordination of these subunits to execute significant functions in the arenavirus life cycle.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05192009-095740/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Montana Zion: American Communalism in a Mormon Fundamentalist Community</field><field name="creator">Weidow, Lesley June</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the founding and development of Pinesdale, Montana. Established by the Mormon fundamentalist leader Rulon Allred and his group in 1961, the town served as a haven for those practicing polygamy as well as an opportunity for group members to live a Mormon form of communalism known as the United Order. Compelled by the social upheaval and shifting cultural standards in the United States and instability in international affairs during the Cold War era, the fundamentalists considered the two practices to be essential to Christian perfection and preparation for a biblical Apocalypse and Millennium. But as a sect comprised of individuals who broke away from the Latter-day Saint Church, dissension continued to characterize the group, compromising communal efforts. The conflict between communalism and individualism in the community recalled an archetypical American struggle that can be traced to Puritan communities and seen repeated in the history of the American West. Like other groups in the West, Pinesdale wanted to preserve its autonomy, but when it sought self-government by incorporating as a city, it became dependent upon the American government. This pushed the community further into the mainstream, a tendency accelerated by the loss of an apocalyptic paradigm at the end of the Cold War. The story of Pinesdale here contributes to a growing scholarship of communalism in America and ethnic groups in the West that is more inclusive and less exceptional, and demonstrates how American the community had been in the context of the postwar period.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05192009-103229/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass Spectrometric Characterization and Fluorophore-Assisted Light Inactivation of Human Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter</field><field name="creator">Ye, Ran</field><field name="description">Glia-expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) mediates the bulk of glutamate re-uptake in the human central nervous system (CNS) and is associated with a variety of neurological disorders. Our understanding of the structure and mechanism of this integral membrane protein is limited. The goal of this study was to use pharmacological, mass spectrometric (MS) and photochemical approaches to probe EAAT2. For MS characterization, a hexahis epitope was incorporated into the N-terminus of human EAAT2. The recombinant protein was functionally expressed in HEK 293T cells and purified through a single-step nickel column. In-gel and in-solution trypsin digestions were conducted on the isolated protein. Overall, eighty-nine percent sequence coverage of the protein was achieved. An 88-amino acid tryptic peptide covering the proposed substrate binding site was revealed after N-deglycosylation. This study provided an efficient and simple method to purify, digest and characterize integral membrane proteins by MS. In addition, the EAAT2 peptide fingerprint obtained by digestion offered a template for later protein modification studies. In an effort to design photoaffinity labels for hEAAT2, a series of aryl diaminopropionic acids and aryl aspartylamide compounds were synthesized and characterized as potent EAAT inhibitors. Compounds containing 9-fluorenone groups were found to be able to irreversibly inactivate EAATs under UV-A illumination. The mechanism underlying the photo-inactivation was shown to be singlet oxygen mediated protein oxidation. The specificity of the photo-inactivation was illustrated by the protection effects of inhibitors, as well as the proximity between the transporter and ligands. Trypsin digestion and MS analyses revealed a mass change of a peptide from hEAAT2 binding pocket in the photo-inactivated protein. Molecular docking results supported our speculation that a tryptophan residue was oxidized during the photo-inactivation. The identification of possible EAAT2 photo-inactivation site provided additional information for the location of the EAAT2 lipophilic interaction domain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05192009-104425/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tobacco Use among Alaska Native and American Indian College Students</field><field name="creator">Angstman, Sarah</field><field name="description">The prevalence of tobacco use is disproportionately high among American Indian and Alaska Native people, with rates and patterns of use varying greatly by tribe, community and geographical region. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce this troubling disparity between non-Native and Native rates of use. Among non-Native individuals, the college years are being investigated as a time when lifelong tobacco use patterns may be established, and interventions are being tested to help college students to stop using tobacco. Currently, no interventions have been developed for American Indian or Alaska Native college students. Data obtained from Alaska Native college students at a site in Alaska and American Indian college students at a site in Montana (n = 68 and 105, respectively) were analyzed to describe tobacco use and related characteristics within each population and to determine whether differences existed between the populations with respect to proportion of students using spit tobacco and using tobacco in a ceremonial context. The proportions of current tobacco users in Alaska and Montana were 63% and 54%, respectively. A significantly higher proportion of Montana than Alaska participants used tobacco in a ceremonial context. A significantly higher proportion of Alaska than Montana participants were users of spit tobacco, with some Alaskan participants' use of Iqmik (a homemade substance made from combining leaf tobacco and a regional botanical substance) contributing to that difference. Qualitative research conducted with Alaska Native college student participants in combination with survey results yielded information about the psychosocial factors related to tobacco use and the acceptability of various potential interventions to help Native college students stop using tobacco.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05192009-105326/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Intimate Relationship Education on Relationship Optimism and Attitudes toward Marriage</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Veronica Ida</field><field name="description">This study evaluated the effects of relationship education on undergraduate students' optimism about relationships and attitudes toward marriage. Participants included undergraduate students enrolled in an Intimate and Family Relations class and students enrolled in a comparison class at the University of Montana. Students were assessed during the first week of the fall semester, 2008, and again at the conclusion of fall semester, 2008. Students' attitudes and optimism towards marriage and intimate relationships were assessed using the Optimism about Relationships scale (Carnelly &amp; Janoff-Bulman, 1992), the Family-of-Origin scale (Hovestadt, Anderson, Piercy, Cochran, &amp; Fine, 1985), and the Marital Attitude Scale (Braaten &amp; Ros&#232;n, 1998). This study focused on whether taking an Intimate and Family Relations class had differential effects on students whose parents previously divorced as compared with students from non-divorced families.

This thesis questions why the province of Almer&#237;a has the highest concentration of greenhouses in the world and determines what processes led to this industry. The research focuses on local-global scale interactions and environmental history analysis within a political ecology framework. The methods for data collection included literature review of secondary sources and four months living in Almer&#237;a conducting interviews and field observations. Located in Europes driest desert, the greenhouses of Almer&#237;a produce millions of tons of produce for European markets. Initially fueled by abundant aquifer water, years of heavy water usage have depleted the quality of the water and led to innovative methods for reducing water use and the introduction of desalination. The Almer&#237;a hydropolitics associated with water usage and distribution highlight the importance of the greenhouse sector to various levels of government. Almer&#237;as environmental history demonstrates profound climate and landscape modifications by human actions fueled by local-global exchanges for resources. Expanding on the geographer David Touts 1980s research on Almer&#237;a greenhouses, this thesis compares current and past issues, economic and land development, and technologies within the greenhouse sector. This case study presents an opportunity for examining the processes that shaped the environmental history through local-global exchanges that are unique to Almer&#237;a.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05202008-114939/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MULTI-PARTNER MUTUALISMS: INTERACTIONS AMONG THE MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE AND TWO OPHIOSTOMATOID FUNGAL ASSOCIATES</field><field name="creator">Bleiker, Katherine Patricia</field><field name="description">I investigated interactions between the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and its two main ophiostomatoid fungal associates,Grosmannia clavigera and Ophiostoma montium, as well as interactions between the two fungi. The main research questions were: What drives bark beetle fungal interactions? What is the nature of the interaction between the two species of fungi? I tested the hypothesis that the fungi provide nutritional benefits to the bark beetles. Evidence suggests a nutritional role of fungi in the diet of bark beetles because beetles emerging from attacked trees carrying G. clavigera were larger than beetles carrying O. montium, which in turn were larger than beetles without either fungus. Larval choice feeding experiments indicate that the two fungi may actually provide complimentary benefits. To address the second question, I tested for competition between the two fungi on artificial media. Growth of each species slowed when it encountered media occupied by the other species, indicating competition; however, both species eventually invaded media occupied by the other species. Although G. clavigera colonized unoccupied media the fastest, O. montium was more effective in colonizing media occupied by G. clavigera when their relative growth rates were considered. In another study, the relative abundances of the two fungi were sampled in beetle-attacked trees in the field over the one year life cycle of the insect. I found no evidence of interference competition, but exploitation competition was prevalent after a year when the fungi co-occurred in the phloem. Finally, I examined whether the two fungi are differentially transported in the mycangia and on the exoskeleton of the beetle using scanning electron microscopy and isolating fungi from the mycangia and elytra. I found no evidence of differential transport of G. clavigera or O. montium in the mycangia and on the exoskeleton from isolation data. There was also no evidence that one fungus was more likely to be transported on the exoskeleton than the other species using electron microscopy. The fungi appear to exist in the mycangium in an altered, yeast or yeast-like state rather than as conidia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05202008-120358/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Henry Meloy: The Portraits, A Narrative of the Exhibition</field><field name="creator">Rodriguez, Kathryn Lorraine</field><field name="description">The Montana Museum of Art &amp; Culture (MMAC) exhibited the portraiture of Montana modernist painter Henry Meloy in July and August of 2007.

This study uses household surveys from 1993-1994 and 1998 in South Africa to investigate why. Models of subjective well-being are estimated following previous literature and a Oaxaca decomposition is then applied, which allows subjective well-being and the determinants of subjective well-being to be examined in a new framework. The decomposition determines what portion of the life satisfaction increase in South Africa is due to improvements in living conditions and what portion is due to changes in the way certain factors reward life satisfaction. The results suggest that fully 92.9 percent of the increase in life satisfaction is due to changes in the reward from the factors considered, not to improvements in living conditions. The results suggest that the determinants of subjective well-being can change substantially over time, and that changes in governmental and social systems can be as or more important than more commonly considered determinants of subjective well-being.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05202009-140701/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STEWARDSHIP IN WEST AFRICAN VODUN: A CASE STUDY OF OUIDAH, BENIN</field><field name="creator">JANSSEN, HAYDEN THOMAS</field><field name="description">Indigenous, animistic religions inherently convey a close relationship and stewardship for the environment. This stewardship is very apparent in the region of southern Benin, Africa. The Fon peoples of this region practice a traditional religion termed Vodun, which manifested from the 17th century slave trade, and subsequently migrated to the Caribbean and Americas where it transmuted into Voodoo, among other religions. The migration of pre-colonial religious canon to the Western Hemisphere has garnered ample study; however, the pioneering religion, Vodun, has received far less scholastic attention, despite Benins recognition of Vodun as a national religion. In this thesis, I contend that the Fon exemplify a society that incorporates rites and rituals of their animistic religion into their daily lives expressed through forms of stewardship, particularly as it pertains to the For&#234;t Sacr&#233;e de Kpass&#233;. This fusion of religious tradition with environmental interaction is inseparable, as are the subsequent environmental effects.

It adapts the standard identity-augmented utility model to demonstrate that, given the choice to participate or not to participate, increases in inequality can decrease overall group participation, and an individual's distance from the characteristics of an ideal community member can also decrease the benefits and likelihood of participation. The theory predicts, however, that increasing the responsiveness of civic bodies to input from citizens can mitigate the negative effects of inequality. Original survey data from a stratified random sample of over 680 Missoula households are then analyzed to test the implications of the theory. In Missoula, people have 3 participation options: not participating at all, participating alone (by writing letters or watching meetings on television), or participating in person. A multinomial logit model to estimate the probability of choosing a certain outcome shows that people living in neighborhoods characterized by high inequality are less likely to drop out, but more likely to participate alone. This effect is most pronounced under high educational inequality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05212007-154919/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Cumulative Effects of Forest Fire on Watershed Hydrology: A Post-fire Application of the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model (DHSVM)</field><field name="creator">Stonesifer, Crystal S.</field><field name="description">The Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was applied to the Eightmile Creek watershed in western Montana. The purpose of this research was primarily to assess the applicability of the model as a cumulative effects assessment tool in the post-fire landscape of a forested watershed in this region. The model was first calibrated to the pre-fire watershed conditions using six years of historic streamflow data. DHSVM was able to accurately simulate the general shape of the measured hydrograph for each of the six simulated water years, and the normalized median absolute error statistics were below the target threshold of 50% for each year simulated. This relative success of the calibration efforts is particularly surprising when one considers the significant limitations presented by the lack of any sub-daily or high-elevation meteorological data for use in driving the calibration simulations. Because the accuracy of DHSVM simulations were greatly improved through rigorous calibration, this research demonstrates the need for model calibration to a watershed of interest, prior to hydrologic simulations of different landscape scenarios. Next, two different calibrated versions of DHSVM, including DHSVM version 2.0.1 and the DHSVM fire model, were each used to simulate runoff in the Eightmile Creek watershed following a near catchment-wide stand-replacing forest fire. Due to weather anomalies and limited, discontinuous streamflow data, no decisive conclusions could be made regarding the performance of either version of the model in the validation efforts. Results do suggest, though, that the DHSVM fire model has the potential to outperform the standard model version in fire-affected landscapes. Further research utilizing the DHSVM fire model with more substantial post-fire streamflow records for model validation is warranted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05222007-143739/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the Relationship of Physical Activity with Inflammation and Cardiovascular Disease Risk</field><field name="creator">Gubler, Coral Michelle</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 37.1 percent of all deaths in the United States. Physical activity is inversely related to both CV event risk and to many of the individual CVD risk factors. The inverse relationship between physical activity and CVD risk is well established. However, much dispute remains about the optimal physical activity intensity and duration related to health benefits and to lower CVD risk. The ability to objectively measure intensity and duration may clarify the inverse relationship between physical activity and CVD. The purpose of this collection of studies was to explore the association of physical activity with CVD and attempt to identify some specifics of this complex relationship. Results: In healthy sedentary individuals aged 31 to 66, 2 different activity accumulation programs were effective in increasing physical activity and resulted in improved fitness and blood glucose. However, the improvement in activity was not of sufficient intensity to provide changes in multiple heart disease risk factors or inflammation. In a cross-section sample of males and females aged 18 to 65, both active and sedentary, the relationship between physical activity and CVD risk varied by age group. The inverse relationship between physical activity and CVD risk was confirmed. However, reaching higher intensity levels for 1 minute periods at least 5 minutes a day appears to be better related to lower risk of CVD than longer durations of moderate or vigorous activity per day, particularly in younger individuals. In a sample of stroke survivors aged 50 to 72, 3 out of 6 of the modifiable risk factors for CVD were present. In these stroke survivors, physical activity intensity and duration were well below current recommendations and insufficient for CVD risk reduction. Conclusions: Accumulating activity can be effective in meeting physical activity recommendations however both duration and intensity requirements must be achieved. Combinations of higher intensities for shorter durations may also be effective in CVD risk reduction.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05222008-100646/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HUNTERS IN THE GARDEN: YUPIK SUBSISTENCE AND THE AGRICULTURAL MYTHS OF EDEN</field><field name="creator">Kuntz, Benjamin</field><field name="description">Yupik writers and Yupik subsistence offer valuable challenges, parallels, and alternative models to mainstream nature writings discourse surrounding human relationships to the land, a discourse that carries an inherent agricultural bias.

The invertebrate respiration scaling exponent was 0.474 (+/- 0.068, 95% CI) across six orders in body mass, which is significantly lower than the &#190; power scaling predicted by metabolic theory. Invertebrate production was dominated by copepods (Diacyclops, Acanthocyclops, Bryocamptus), Stygobromus amphipods, and amphibiont stoneflies, and ranged from 26.9 to 4200 mg C/m3 sediment/year. Production and density showed a U-shaped response to dissolved oxygen (high production at both low and high oxygen concentrations). Production declined exponentially with depth for most sites, but at sites with orthograde oxygen profiles there was an exponential increase at the oxycline. Aerobic microbial community production ranged from 1210 to 2020 mg C/m3 sediment/year, also showing a U-shaped response to oxygen. System respiratory quotient (RQ) ranged from &#8776; 0 to 9.5, indicating a significant contribution of anaerobic production to system energy flow. We documented multiple lines of evidence for DOC (soil, river) and buried POM carbon sources, however POM was by far the largest carbon reservoir in the aquifer at &#8776; 108 (to 1010) mg C/ m3 sediment. Energy from POM breakdown was the only source sufficient to explain microbial and invertebrate production. Carbon stable isotope signatures showed strong levels of depletion for invertebrates (&#948;13C -25 to -70). These results suggest a significant anaerobic subsidy of aerobic food webs in the subsurface, and a potential methane subsidy of 10% to 99% of invertebrate energy flow. Oxygen showed high, non-random, spatial and temporal variation across the aquifer, with a large scale decline in oxygen along the axis of the floodplain, and distinct hotspots of low oxygen. Low oxygen hotspots corresponded with migration of stonefly nymphs 100s of meters into the aquifer. The U-shaped responses and biogeochemical trends suggest a major threshold at bulk oxygen concentrations of 3-5 mg/l. Collectively, these findings indicate the role of dissolved oxygen as a key variable in groundwater ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05232007-165824/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dwelling and the Woman Artist in The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</field><field name="creator">Lupold, Rebecca L.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the Heideggerean notion of dwelling in Anne Bront&#235;s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall by analyzing the different ways the novels protagonist, Helen Huntingdon, adapts to the harsh, sublime landscape of Wildfell Hall and the subsequent relationship that develops between her and Gilbert Markham. Escaping her violent and abusive husband, Helen flees to Wildfell Hall and uses her skills as an artist to support both herself and her son. In the first chapter, late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century aesthetics of the sublime and the picturesque are evaluated in relation to the aesthetic spaces of the novel. Helen enjoys an intimate connection to the landscape both at Grassdale and Wildfell Hall, and she finds solace and freedom in nature. But the aesthetics of the picturesque both provide a space for Helen and confine her. In the second chapter, these confines will be explored more fully. Helen remains under the gaze of those around her, both the individual males who wish to control her and the community members who try to judge her. The domestic sphere also confines her; the home becomes a site of imprisonment rather than the safe, nurturing space upheld by Victorian society. The second chapter also develops Helens role as a sublime heroine, which is analyzed more fully in the third chapter, which primarily focuses on how Helen challenges the norms of the Victorian heroine. Gilbert also challenges the norms for the Victorian hero. Their roles in the novel emphasize reciprocal relationships, both with human beings as well as with the land and animals. The narrative structure of the novel suggests this sort of relationality as well and an analysis of its significance will form a part of the concluding chapter of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05232008-101518/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendens) show self-control for access to a mirror</field><field name="creator">Collins, Christopher Matthew</field><field name="description">Self control is defined as choosing a larger, delayed reinforcer over a smaller, more immediate reinforcer with the opposite defined as impulsivity. In general, results from self-control research involving avian and non-primate mammalian subjects have shown a strong to moderate impulsive choice bias whereas studies using adult humans and non-human primates have shown a strong self-control bias. While the non-human self-control literature is rich with studies using select avian and mammalian species, there is very little self-control literature on the choice behaviors of fish or social reward. The present experiment assessed preference in male Betta splendens using an immediate/2 sec mirror access option verses a 15 sec delay/15 sec mirror access option.

There is a shared act of imagination between its writer and reader(Welty 805). This shared act is what allows the writer to take a stand and say something important about life and people. Instead of looking at the generalities of a social cause, Welty looks at the individual involved in the cause, or an individual living in a certain time period. She explores how the social rules effect the people living in that time. She is not exploring the social rules and how they should be changed on a large scale, but only in how it effects certain people in the community. Through this personal exploration, Welty believes that her writing is more powerful than a novelist who takes on a cause head on. This chapter will explore that idea.

This goal was important to me for two reasons. The first reason was that for many years I had suppressed my own need to create and express myself through art for various reasons: lack of instruction and fear of stepping out of the box and expressing myself creatively. My final creative project has led to an awakening of my ability to express myself through my artwork and make personal connections with my paintings. Focusing on the basic elements of art in my instruction and integrating this new knowledge into each of my paintings has produced a great deal of personal growth as an artist. The second reason this goal was important to me was that integrating the fine arts into the curriculum of the public schools has always been a priority. Teaching visual arts to the students in my regular education classroom was something I have strived for, yet I felt I lacked the skills needed to teach it well. This project resulted in the realization that I was an artist who could produce works of art pleasing to others and myself as well. In addition to addressing my lack of personal art and development as an artist, I also resolved the problem of having the skills and knowledge to bring quality art instruction into the classroom. While this creative project has been focused primarily on my own artistic development, my students will reap the benefits of my growth for years to come.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Visual and Performing Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05242010-174014/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing Macroinvertebrate Community Recovery in Post Restoration Silver Bow Creek, Montana</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Sean Patrick</field><field name="description">Since the turn of the twentieth century, mining activities have contaminated the floodplain and streambed of Silver Bow Creek, Montana, resulting in a streambed devoid of life and severely contaminated with heavy metals. In the mid nineteen seventies, up-stream water treatment facilities were upgraded and water quality improved, bringing benthic invertebrates back to reaches of Silver Bow Creek. The extent and concentration of toxicants in and around the streams of the Upper Clark Fork River Basin resulted in the designation of over 100 miles of river as Federal Superfund sites. Since 1999 reclamation and restoration efforts have been implemented on Silver Bow Creek. This analysis evaluates changes in benthic biotic community composition throughout the period of record (1986 to 2009). Transformations of historical data were necessary to standardize community information and calculate indices of biotic integrity. A multivariate method, Classification Strength (CS), used in conjunction with non-parametric tests of significance, demonstrated data comparability over the period of record both taxonomically and ecologically. Biotic index results indicate that remedial efforts to remove metals laden sediment from the stream bed and surrounding floodplain have resulted in a decline in the numbers of metal-tolerant organisms. Generalized indices of biotic integrity show no significant changes throughout the period, while specialized indices demonstrate increases in organic-pollutant-tolerant taxa. Multivariate analysis of community composition demonstrates taxonomic changes to the resident community throughout the period of record, and Indicator Species Analysis corroborates the results of the biotic indices. Using these methodologies as a template to measure change throughout the restored reaches of Silver Bow Creek will increase the ability of resource managers to measure the success of restoration of the Last Best Disturbance.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05252010-191118/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wavelengths</field><field name="creator">Weaver, Rachel Faith</field><field name="description">A novel excerpt exploring motherhood and the implications of its loss.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05262007-133150/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TRAINING CHARACTERISTICS OF MALES AT THE 2008 NCAA DIVISION I CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS</field><field name="creator">Keller, Philip A</field><field name="description">The focus of previous running research has been on physiological determinates of performance utilizing small sample sizes and short time frames with little regard to previous training methods. PURPOSE: The goal of this research was to describe, compare, and evaluate the relationships between anthropometric, run training, and ancillary training variables during the 2008 season and performance of male finishers at the NCAA Division I cross country championship 10k race. METHODOLOGY: An online survey was created based on previous research and all coaches who had male runners finish the 2008 NCAA championship race were asked to include their athletes in the online survey. 42 out of 252 runners (17%) completed the survey. RESULTS: Runners with better pre-college 1600 meter (r = 0.37) and 3200 meter (r = 0.32) track times ran faster at the championship race. A composite of these pre-college times was the best significant (p &lt; 0.05) predictor of performance (adj. r2 = 0.12). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed an increased number of core training sessions during the peak period and form/drill sessions during the transition period also were significant (p &lt; 0.05) predictors of slower 10k finish time. Threshold training during the peak period was a significant (p &lt;0.05) predictor of 10k finish time (adj r2 = 0.07) when compared only to run-training variables. Evidence of the training principles of progressive overload, periodization, specialization, and tapering were evident in the data. CONCLUSION: Recruiting faster runners is important for college coaches to have successful teams. Due to a low number of significant (p &lt; 0.05) findings, there is no single best training method when training for the 10k race although excessive ancillary training can hinder rest and hurt run-training and race performance while threshold training during the peak period can lead to overtraining and slower performance times at the NCAA championship 10k race. Optimal performance in the NCAA cross country championship 10k race is dependent on coaches who can recruit faster runners and best integrate all training methods into each period and the entire season specific for his/her athletes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05262009-154309/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ranches with Wolves: How straight talk is the salvation of open range in the Northern Rockies</field><field name="creator">Grant, James Wilson</field><field name="description">Since U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reintroduced gray wolves into Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho in 1995 and 1996, conflicts between wolves and livestock have increased as the wolf population has grown and expanded. Ranchers in wolf country face a changing ecology that now includes wolves as a keystone predator, and failing to adapt to the change has meant hard losses for some ranchers. In other cases, ranchers have found ways to compensate for the reintroduced predator. These ranching situations, both the unchanged and the changed, offer lessons to livestock producers who can anticipate wolves becoming part of the landscape. And the values most likely to make the transition from ranching without a viable wolf population to ranching with a viable population as painless as possible, the ranchers say, are communication and cooperation between themselves, their neighbors, wildlife managers and government trappers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05262010-105050/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel roles of the endocannabinoid system in modulating synaptic plasticity</field><field name="creator">Angell, Alicia Ninet</field><field name="description">Learning and memory formation are invaluable processes in human life; however, the cellular mechanisms that control these phenomena are largely unknown. Synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of the synapse between two neurons to change in strength based on activity, is believed to be a key process in the formation of memories and learning. Endocannabinoids (eCB) have recently emerged as important modulators of synaptic plasticity but their precise roles and mechanisms are not well understood and many contradictions exist in the current literature. We have investigated the roles of eCBs and their primary receptor, the CB1 receptor, in the central nervous system using electrophysiological recordings in rodent hippocampus. We find that a moderate frequency 10 Hz stimulation protocol produces long-term potentiation (LTP) that is modulated by eCBs in both mice and rats; but surprisingly, the roles played by eCBs differ greatly between species. In rats, 10 Hz LTP requires CB1 receptor activation, as it is completely abolished by the CB1 antagonists AM251 and SR141716. Unlike theta burst stimulation (TBS) induced LTP, 10 Hz LTP does not require NMDA receptor activation. However, it is prevented when both NMDA and group1 mGluR receptors are blocked. The 10 Hz LTP is also independent of GABAergic synaptic inhibition, suggesting it is a novel form of excitatory synaptic plasticity mediated by the eCB system in hippocampus. In mice, we find that CB1 has an inhibitory effect on 10 Hz induced LTP. When the receptor is genetically removed in CB1 (-/-) mice or pharmacologically blocked wild type mice, 10 Hz LTP is greatly facilitated. Similar to TBS LTP, 10 Hz LTP in mice is NMDA receptor mediated. Also, the ability to achieve successful long-term depression (LTD) is decreased in CB1 (-/-) mice; yet, the magnitude of successful LTD is not changed. Together, this data supports a role for the CB1 receptor in inhibiting the induction of LTP with moderate stimulation protocols in mice, while in rats CB1 activation is required for 10 Hz LTP. Overall, our data supports that eCBs are crucial modulators of synaptic plasticity, although the roles they play may differ among species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

These fungi may affect a wide range of ecosystem processes from primary productivity to soil stabilization. Understanding the patterns and controls of AMF abundance during succession soil will be critical to predicting and managing ecosystem development. The work presented in chapter 2 is the first to describe changes in the abundance of mycorrhizal types during development of an unregulated floodplain. These findings are important to floodplain regulation and management strategies as they suggest that flow regulation that limits early site formation will limit the ecosystem contributions of AMF on dammed rivers. Chapter 3 builds on the findings from chapter 2 to determine the mechanisms of how litter may affect the abundance of a native AMF community. We test the hypothesis that litter from cottonwoods (Populus sp.) is inhibitory to AMF colonization. Our works shows that even small amounts of litter and realistic concentrations of litter leachates can strongly inhibit AMF colonization of two plant species, and that this inhibition is not solely a result of changes in the soil nutrient status. Chapter 3 also demonstrates that common soluble phenolics found in cottonwood litter are inhibitory to AMF at ecologically realistic concentrations, whereas other root colonizing fungi are unaffected. These findings offer another explanatory mechanism for the shift we and others have observed between AMF and ECMF during succession. Chapter 4 addresses the potential consequences of a changing AMF community with respect to the key AMF mediated process of soil stabilization. This work is the first to document a significant interaction between co-occurring species of plants and AMF in soil aggregate formation. Chapter 5 synthesizes our findings with others to understand the potential consequences and management options to control AMF succession and species composition in agroecosystems. Chapter 6 is a product of my work with the ECOS program, and is a lesson on the importance of soil organic matter that is designed for the youngest of students. The significance of this body of work is discussed in chapter 7.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-134138/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disruption of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine DNA Glycosylase (OGG1) Antioxidant Response Capacity by Sodium Arsenite</field><field name="creator">Cox, David Paul</field><field name="description">8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine DNA glycosylase is the first step and rate-limiting enzyme involved in the removal of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine via the base excision repair pathway. Transcriptional regulation of human Ogg1 is sensitive to redox changes via modulation of intracellular glutathione. In response to changes in glutathione, changes in hOgg1 transcription occur similar to genes regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2. It was determined that positions - 47 to - 44 in the hOgg1 promoter are necessary for basal transcription of Ogg1 determined by site-directed deletion. This region is capable of interacting with nuclear protein determined by binding assays. Furthermore, transcription factor Nrf2 is identified as binding to this region determined by parallel, and competition EMSA binding assays. Exposure to arsenic has also been associated with oxidative stress and damage to DNA, specifically oxo8dG. This study identified significant increases in the cellular antioxidant glutathione, and alterations in superoxide dismutase activities subsequent to arsenite exposure in actively dividing and NGF treated PC12 cells. Assessment of Ogg1 activity and mRNA levels demonstrated a significant decrease for both measures subsequent to arsenite exposure. The effect seen was due in large part to alterations in gene transcription since direct testing revealed no effect by arsenite on Ogg1 activity. Levels of oxo8dG did not significantly change subsequent to arsenite exposure, however increased trends were evident. Characterization of Sp1 binding revealed that treatment with sodium arsenite could decrease Sp1 binding at two unique Sp1 sites in the human Ogg1 promoter. In summary, transcription factor Nrf2 is an important factor in the inducible regulation of Ogg1. Transcriptional changes in Ogg1 are further dependent on the redox status of the cell. Despite the role of Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress, sodium arsenite disrupted both the transcription and activity of Ogg1 in PC12 cells. This disruption occurred despite the induction of cellular stress response via increases in GSH and Mn SOD activity. This suggests that arsenite is acting through other mechanisms potentially through disruption of the Sp1 transcription factor.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

Species of nitrogen and phosphorus are the nutrients of focus and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS) and fecal coliform are the pollutants. Prior work has focused on design concepts, plant effects on nutrient and pollutant treatment, and annualized treatment performance characteristics. This work builds upon published design concepts and wetland plant community and its function and investigates seasonal treatment performance and the kinetics of treatment performance for certain nutrients and pollutants during each season. Previous engineering based work has broadly suggested that first order kinetics govern the treatment chemistry of constructed wetlands. This work further investigates wetland chemistry by evaluating zero, first and second order kinetics for each season for certain nutrients and pollutants and compares regression analysis results between the orders. The results suggest that second order kinetics more closely describe the treatment kinetics realized. In addition, this work investigates an alternate function for constructed wetlands as a nutrient and pollutant buffer with the wetland effluent providing irrigation water for industrial crops. The industrial crops are then proposed to be utilized for energy production. Furthermore, a simple design model attempts to provide a rapid assessment of feasibility of constructed wetlands as a nutrient and pollutant buffer. The design model may be used by a municipality to quickly determine the feasibility of installing a wetland irrigation system as part of their overall wastewater treatment system. Finally, a simple mathematical correlation between a municipality's diesel fuel use and the projected size of a constructed wetland is presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-135409/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Landscape Approach to Grassland Bird Conservation in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Northern Great Plains</field><field name="creator">Quamen, Frank Royce</field><field name="description">Prairie is one of the most imperiled ecosystems, and grassland birds have experienced steeper and more consistent declines than any other group of birds in North America. Habitat-based planning tools are a cornerstone of conservation in forested ecosystems, but remain a novel approach in grasslands. In Chapter 2, I develop spatially-explicit habitat models as decision support tools for conservation. I survey birds, measure local vegetation and quantify landscape features at 952 sites in western Minnesota and northwest Iowa. Findings indicate that cropland provides little habitat for grassland songbirds and that hayland does not compensate for loss of grasslands. Multiscale models show that conservation actions that integrate management at local and landscape scales have the greatest chance of success. At landscape scales, conserving and creating grasslands, removing trees from the landscape, or both, increase songbird density. Density of many species is positively related to amount of grassland at the smallest scale evaluated (0.5km2), but large grasslands are vital for others whose density is related to grassland abundance at large scales (32km2). At local scales, managing for a mosaic of vegetation that varies in structure and composition increases bird diversity. Model validation shows that planning maps can be used reliably (r2 &#8805; 0.90) to establish a regional conservation strategy. I used spatially-explicit maps to identify five landscapes capable of attracting the highest densities of the greatest number of songbirds, and show that most of this habitat is unprotected from risk of conversion to other land uses. Models in Chapter 2 confirm that woody edges exacerbate effects of habitat loss, so in Chapter 3 I test whether birds use otherwise suitable habitats by experimentally removing trees in a before-after/control-impact design. This is the first study to experimentally show that songbirds avoid woody edges in otherwise suitable habitat. Avoidance of trees is apparent as far away from woody edges as surveys were conducted (240m). The spring following tree removal, the four most common species redistributed themselves ubiquitously in grasslands where trees were removed. I recommend that managers remove trees from grasslands and avoid planting trees in grasslands where conservation of songbirds is the management goal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-154616/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Among Washington State County Commissioners Knowledge and Perceptions of Washington State University Extension and Their Willingness to Fund WSU Extension</field><field name="creator">Lindstrom, James Hilmer</field><field name="description">The study determined the relationship between perceptions that the Washington State county commissioners' hold of WSU Extension and their knowledge of WSU Extension. In addition, the study determined whether their perceptions, knowledge, and/or understanding of Extension are related to and thereby may have predictability to their willingness to provide the essential local funding to continue the educational programs Extension delivers. The study addressed the interest Washington State county commissioners/county council members have in funding WSU Extension, which directly affects the critical element of maximizing Extension's impact on society. As a publicly funded educational organization, WSU Extension faces an uncertain fiscal future as funding partners face financial stress. Without funding from the key partners, such as county government, WSU Extension would not be able to continue to provide educational programming and nor would society benefit from the verifiable impacts that Extension has imparted for the past 100 years. An electronic census was administered through a variety of methods to insure sufficient response. There were 43 responses representing each of the 39 counties in Washington State. County commissioners have knowledge of Extension and the educational programs delivered to constituents. Respondents attend Extension programs, read Extension produced newsletters, join Extension educational organizations such as 4-H and access the web resources that Extension produces. Commissioners report that they are willing to continue to fund Extension in both times of financial adequacy and insufficiency. Based on the data, county commissioners in Washington State believe that WSU Extension is effective; the programs that Extension delivers are of good quality and beneficial to their constituents. Extension services are considered to be a good value for the level of county expenditure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-155040/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Leadership Role in Online Support Programs for Beginning Teachers</field><field name="creator">Clouse, Nancy K. Gagen</field><field name="description">As distance learning opportunities foster a wide array for online mentoring, program administrators are in need of research supporting the successful development and management of such efforts. This qualitative research examined the leadership perspectives, skills, and strategies involved in developing and administering an online support program (also referred to as electronic mentoring) designed to help beginning teachers transition into the profession and improve their retention (National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, 2003). The population was comprised of all known programs established to date in the United States. Interviews were conducted of 28 program administrators representing 20 online programs for new teachers. Data were collected via interviews and triangulated with multiple artifacts. Consistent with practices by Strauss and Corbin (2007), data were analyzed using open, axial, and selective coding to identify, organize, and relate categories and themes. Through this analysis process, the core category, "The Leadership Role in Online Support Programs for Beginning Teachers," emerged and was based upon the interrelationships among five subcategories: (a) needs and benefits of participants, (b) program development, (c) professional development, (d) technology considerations, and (e) leadership strategies. The grounded theory resulting from these findings concluded that, successful administrators need to develop a detailed plan for online programs, weighing necessary program components including (a) an educationally diverse program team; (b) early establishment of program goals; (c) reliable methods of assessment of outcomes using constant formative evaluation; (d) a secure, reliable, non-evaluative environment; (e) training in effective online communications and relationship building; and (f) a value-added experience for participants. The leadership role of online support programs for beginning teachers requires administrators to have an in-depth understanding of the developmental needs of new teachers in concert with principles of adult learning theory and means of maximizing professional development. Of greater import than technology skills were the ability to effectively communicate online and manage in a collaborative, facilitative, ever-changing environment. Future studies should examine requirements for participants' online engagement, comparative technology for online support systems, roles adopted by facilitators, and methods of assessment of program effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-155603/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LEARNING COMMUNITIES, ACHIEVEMENT AND COMPLETION: EXPLORING RELATIONSHIPS IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA SECONDARY SCHOOLS</field><field name="creator">Beres, Corrienne Janet</field><field name="description">Longitudinal studies carried out by Statistics Canada and Human Resources Development Canada (Bowlby &amp; McMullen, 2002) identified that dropout rates are high in Canada in relation to other developed nations. In 2003, Alberta's Commission on Learning found that one quarter of Alberta's high school enrollees were not completing high school. The Commission proposed the formation of learning communities as one way to increase the achievement of students in Alberta, with the intention that this would then increase the number of students completing high school. This research was undertaken to ascertain how mature the learning communities were in the high schools in Zone 6 of Southern Alberta, and whether there was a relationship between the maturity of a school's learning community and the school's achievement and high school completion rates. As the findings demonstrate, some relationships may have existed between the maturity of the schools' learning community and the diploma examination results, especially in Social Studies. Correlations were not found between the maturity of a school's learning community and eligibility for Rutherford Scholarships, the percentage of students taking four or more diploma examinations, and high school completion rates. The research did show, however, the levels of maturity in each of the learning communities at the time of this study, and the areas requiring further attention. The dimension of the learning communities requiring the most attention was found to be in the area of peer observation and feedback.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-160145/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ANALYSIS OF ALBERTA'S FIRST NATIONS, METIS, AND INUIT SCHOOL-COMMUNITY LEARNING ENVIRONMENT PROJECT</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Kelly Burke</field><field name="description">The First Nations, M&#233;tis, and Inuit School-Community Learning Environment Project was one of the programs through which the Aboriginal Branch of Alberta Education attempted to increase the academic success rate of First Nation, M&#233;tis, and Inuit students. Sixteen school jurisdictions in Alberta were asked to choose one school within their district on which to focus the resources offered by the Project. These resources included a large amount of money and print materials prepared by the Aboriginal Branch. The schools were asked to consult with the school community and area residents, including elders, to prepare strategies they believed would fulfill the goals of the First Nations, M&#233;tis, and Inuit School-Community Learning Environment Project. The first goal of the Project, and the one this quantitative study examines, was to increase the number of students who obtained the acceptable standard on the Provincial Achievement Tests. The Project was initiated in the 2003-2004 school year and ended in 2004-2005. This study compares the means of the numbers of students who obtained the acceptable standard on the Provincial Achievement Tests in the two years before the Project began, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003; two years during the Project, 2003-2004 and 2004-2005; and two years after the Project ended, 2005-2006 and 2006-2007. This study also compares the strategies each school used to achieve the goal of increasing the numbers of students attaining the acceptable standard on the Provincial Achievement Tests. In addition, 12 schools were purposefully quota sampled that were not part of the Project; the numbers of students who obtained the acceptable standard on the Provincial Achievement Tests in these schools were compared with the numbers of students who obtained the acceptable standard in schools that were part of the Project. Analysis of the results indicated that, generally speaking, the First Nations, M&#233;tis, and Inuit School-Community Learning Environment Project resulted in only nominal improvements in increasing the academic success of First Nation, M&#233;tis, and Inuit students attending schools that took part in the Project.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-161011/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OXIDATIVE STRESS AND THE GUANOSINE NUCLEOTIDE TRIPHOSPHATE POOL: IMPLICATIONS FOR A BIOMARKER AND MECHANISM OF IMPAIRED CELL FUNCTION</field><field name="creator">Bolin, Celeste Maree</field><field name="description">Oxidation of the guanosine (G) moiety, yielding the oxidized lesion 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (oxo82dG), in DNA has become a hallmark biomarker in assessing cellular outcomes induced by oxidative stress. It is well established that the guanosine nucleotide triphosphate pool is also susceptible to oxidative stress and suggested to be more available for oxidation than DNA due to the lack of protective histones and robust repair mechanisms for reducing the levels of all the products of oxidation. The oxidation of guanosine in the nucleotide triphosphate pool, resulting in oxidized guanosine 5'-triphoshate (oxo8GTP), has been overlooked due to the lack of a reliable method. Oxo8GTP has been shown to precede oxidation to G incorporated into DNA and modulate cell processes such as G-protein signaling and RNA synthesis. Evidence is presented in this study of a reliable method to quantify oxo8GTP, a proposed mechanism for the oxidative modification of GTP in the presence of copper and L-ascorbic acid, and evidence of oxo8GTP as an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). A significant induction of oxo8GTP in cell-free preparations as well as in PC12 and HEK 293T cells exposed to physiologically relevant oxidative conditions generated with 10 ?M copper sulphate and 1mM L-Ascorbic Acid (Cu/Asc) is also reported. Exposure to oxidative conditions by Cu/As leads to elevations in oxo8GTP significant enough to result in a reduction of the sGC product, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), by as much as half in pure sGC and PC12 cells. GTP is protected from oxidation in the presence of reduced glutathione and this subsequently rescues sGC activity. This suggests that oxo8GTP is produced by free radicals in vivo and can significantly impact neuronal cell functions regulated by sGC activity in the central nervous system such as synaptic plasticity. Alterations in copper homeostasis and oxidative stress have been implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases as well as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Based upon evaluation of the data presented herein, we hypothesize that neuronal deficiencies in such disorders might be due to oxidation of the GTP pool and the ensuing effects on neuronal function.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-162607/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landslide Susceptibility Zonation GIS for the 2005 Kashmir Earthquake affected region.</field><field name="creator">Growley, Benjamin</field><field name="description">The October 8, 2005 Kashmir earthquake triggered several thousand landslides throughout the Himalaya of northern Pakistan and India. A spatial database, which included 2252 landslides, was developed and analyzed using ASTER satellite imagery and geographical information system (GIS) technology. A multi-criterion evaluation was applied to determine the significance of event-controlling parameters in triggering the landslides. The parameters included lithology, faults, slope gradient, slope aspect, elevation, land cover, rivers and roads. The results were broken down into four classes of landslide susceptibility. The results indicated that lithology had the strongest influence on landsliding, particularly when the rock is highly fractured, such as in the shale, slate, clastic sediments, and limestone and dolomite. Moreover, the proximity of the landslides to faults, rivers, and roads was also an important factor in helping to initiate failures. In addition, landslides occurred particularly in moderate elevations on south facing slopes. Shrub land, grassland, and also agricultural land were highly susceptible to failures, while forested slopes had few landslides. One-third of the study area was highly or very highly susceptible to future landsliding and requires immediate mitigation action. The rest of the region had a low or moderate susceptibility to landsliding and remains relatively stable. This study supports the view that earthquake-triggered landslides are concentrated in specific zones associated with event-controlling parameters. It also concludes that western Himalaya deforestation and road construction are susceptible to landsliding during and shortly after earthquakes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-191310/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scalped</field><field name="creator">Inge, Anne-Marie Waterman</field><field name="description">fine stories, a collection</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272008-234214/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Klonopin Collectifs, the Charms of Diverted Pharmaceuticals and Other Pleasures of Non-Medical Prescription Drug Use</field><field name="creator">Bundy, Henry Erikson</field><field name="description">Much of the epidemiological research conducted on non-medical prescription drug use assumes pharmaceuticals to have fixed, inherent euphorigenic qualities. Quantitative analysis of substance abuse depends on drugs acting predictably. However, this conception of pharmaceuticals has failed to account for the absence of pleasure when prescription drugs are taken as part of corrective or curative regimes. For this thesis I will employ Actor Network Theory (ANT) to explain how a prescription drug can emerge alternately as a substance either amenable to, or unresponsive in, producing pleasure. ANT suggests that the properties attributed to prescription drugs are not deterministic or unimpeachable, but are instead a result of networks of heterogeneous actants. Using interview data collected among young adults about their early non-prescribed pharmaceutical episodes, and comparing these experiences to those of accomplished users, I will illustrate how, during initial periods of transparent indeterminacy, pharmaceutical affects are not discovered, but rather are constructed and enacted through actant relationships.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05272010-142320/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lines of Motion: Streets and Shores</field><field name="creator">Finnigan, Ellen Maureen</field><field name="description">no abstract</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05282008-125535/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE BOOK OF LEFT TURNS</field><field name="creator">Hill Jr., Gregory Trent</field><field name="description">Poems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05282008-191700/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Erosion</field><field name="creator">Hamlin, Lauren Kearns</field><field name="description">Portion of a novel in progress.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05282009-130629/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE JOURNEY TO CREATE MEANINGFUL, ELABORATIVE ART WITH FLUENCY, ORIGINALITY AND FLEXIBILITY</field><field name="creator">Roy, Suzanne Michelle</field><field name="description">I worked to overcome two major problems for my final creative project. The first problem was the lack of meaningful, original art that my students have been creating and their inability to explain their work though an artist statement. The second problem was that I had stopped creating my own art and no longer saw myself as an artist. To resolve the first problem I took my students through a series of age appropriate exercises and lessons to help make personal connections through creative expression, and to promote creative growth. I found ways to put more of themselves in their art and take personal risks. I developed specific units and projects at each grade level that I teach to help foster this personal release though art, and get in touch with the creative process. To resolve the second problem I spent a lot of time in the studio myself, creating art that was meaningful and relevant to my life. I created a body of my own art that was ultimately publicly displayed. I broke down the issue of creativity into an approachable process through teaching; by teaching my students to understand how to put more personal thought into their art, and by teaching myself to rediscover myself as an artist. The following pages outline the process, challenges, and results of this journey for me and my students. My students and I learned to connect our feelings and what is relevant in our lives to our art, and we created meaningful, original work. We found that creating art is cathartic and a powerful way to make a statement and reflect. Through the work in my creative project I have found that my students have a lot to say through their art. Not only do they have a lot to say through art, but so do I.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Pulse</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05282009-131024/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHINESE CLASSIFIER ACQUISITION: COMPARISON OF L1 CHILD AND L2 ADULT DEVELOPMENT</field><field name="creator">Gong, Jiang Song</field><field name="description">The context of this thesis is the long-debated issue of whether or not adult second language (L2) development is basically similar to child first language (L1) development. The thesis approaches the issue through research dealing with L1 acquisition of Chinese classifiers and a pilot study of L2 adult classifier acquisition. First, evidence that children acquire specific classifiers earlier than measure classifiers is discussed and explained in light of existing language learning theories. With the aim of providing comparable data regarding L2 adult classifier acquisition a pilot study was conducted in which nine adult English-speaking learners of Chinese were tested on their production of both specific and measure classifiers. The results show that L2 adults overgeneralized use of the general classifier ge in a way similar to L1 children, suggesting that both L1 and L2 learners are aware of the syntactic requirement for classifiers, but avoid semantic complexities related to shape and other perceptual features. Despite this apparent similarity, L2 adults differ from L1 children in that they develop measure classifiers more successfully than specific classifiers, indicating that the underlying process of classifier acquisition is influenced by L1 knowledge and cognitive maturation. Overall, these findings provide support for the argument that fundamental differences between L1 child and L2 adult acquisition exist, shed light on methods for successful classifier instruction, and open the door for further exploration into L2 development of classifier languages.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05282010-143623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing and Communicating Better Sexual Harassment Policies Through Ethics and Human Rights</field><field name="creator">Hagan, Thain Yates</field><field name="description">no abstract</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292007-115152/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Importance of Individual and Population Variation to Human Stature Estimation</field><field name="creator">Shields, Kelly Jean</field><field name="description">Human stature estimation is a central part of forensic anthropological investigation. It is one of several factors used to identify unknown individuals. The statistical relationship between body length and body segment length allows for long bone lengths from an unidentified individual to be used in a linear regression equation to estimate living stature. These linear regression equations are often formulated from a data set of an entirely different population. This research explores the necessity for the unknown individual to be similar on a number of points to the known population that makes up the equation. Populations are highly variable, and one or two equations should not be applicable for every population. The sample to be examined consists of 22 Hispanic males with known stature and long bone lengths, drawn from the Forensic Data Bank. This data was applied to some of the most commonly used equations today, including: Trotter and Glesers Korean War equations, Hispanic and American White equations from FORDISC, and Genoves Mesoamerican equations. Statistical analysis revealed the necessity for more data collection from Central and South American populations. If this were done, a greater number of unknown individuals could be identified and their remains returned to their families.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292007-145755/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Increments of Green</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Molly K.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292007-152037/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Real Wild West</field><field name="creator">Bigley, Michael Erik</field><field name="description">A series of poems on the landscape and politics of the American West.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292007-160925/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparisons in the cranial form of the Blackfeet Indians:A reassessment of Boas' Native American data</field><field name="creator">Gesler, Jenee Caprice</field><field name="description">Franz Boas proposed almost one hundred yeas ago that cranial plasticity explained the differences in cranial form between European-born immigrants and their American-born children.

These types of changes, including arthritic and musculoskeletal, are based on subjective observation of the researcher and therefore subject to observer error. I used three samples; the Indian Knoll sample, the Nutwood and Rosedale Mound sample, and a control sample from the Terry collection I was able to employ a scoring method based on Hawkey (1988). This current research uses the scoring method for arthritic changes in women to test for changes in patterns of distribution and/or severity when the women transitioned from hunting and gathering to agriculture. This scoring method provides quantifiable data to use for statistical analysis. The observations and scoring method highlight patterns in osteoarthritis which may be interpretable between and within samples. This research found that no single feature of osteoarthritis is significant on its own but looking at several joints and the emerging patterns we can infer stress level changes and possibly narrow these changes down to the types of subsistence activities the individuals participated in. Understanding the change in women before and after the transition to agriculture allows archaeologists to construct a better picture of the daily activity and labor divisions based on age and sex for the population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292008-183635/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcendental Idealism, Transcendental Realism, and the Possibility of Objective Reference</field><field name="creator">Walker, Eric Dane</field><field name="description">The goal of my thesis is to understand why Kant thinks that transcendental idealism can secure empirical realism, the idea that there really exists an objective world that we can come to know through experience. I maintain that, according to Kant, the possibility of coming to know objective reality depends upon the possibility of referring to objects, which itself, Kant thinks, can be explained by transcendental idealism. The transcendental idealist worldview is supposed by Kant to explain the possibility of referring to objects because it recognizes that objects must conform to cognition and not the other way around. Therefore, I explore what Kant means by objects conforming to cognition. I start with the fact that Kant says that the conditions for the possibility of our experience of objects must be identical with the conditions for the possibility of those objects themselves. I then argue that this means that according to the transcendental idealist worldview, objective reality, if it is to be full-blooded objective reality, must be essentially able to show up for us in experience. In opposition to this worldview stands what Kant calls transcendental realism, the prevailing worldview that supposes that full-blooded objective reality simply cannot be essentially able to show up for us in experience. Kant says that the prevailing transcendental realist worldview, of which he claims all philosophies hitherto are variations, will never be able to explain the possibility of referring to objects, and that only his transcendental idealism can. Because Kant imputes so much importance to the opposition, I elaborate the distinction between transcendental idealism and transcendental realism, and clarify why only the latter can, as the former cannot, explain the possibility of referring to objects and thus the possibility of knowing an objective world, and thereby secure an empirical realism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292008-185219/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between Level of Empathy and Stress Contagion</field><field name="creator">Kirby, Heather Lynn</field><field name="description">Although potential benefits associated with social support are well documented, it is also the case that social networks expose an individual to the stressful life events of others. Studies have shown that the stressful life events of others are positively related to negative affect. It has been theorized by several researchers that relationships between, for example, stressful life events of others and negative affect are evidence of a stress contagion process that may occur through empathy. The current study addressed this idea by testing whether the positive relationship that exists between network stress and depressive symptoms varied dependent upon (ie. was moderated by) an individuals level of empathy. A sample of 160 Native American individuals, ages fifty and older, who completed the Coping in Later Life survey was utilized. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that when network stress is measured by number of life events that occurred to others, empathy does moderate the relationship between network stress and depressive symptoms. This significant interaction occurs both when using a global level of empathy and when the Personal Distress dimension of the measure is removed. Personal Distress alone does not moderate the relationship between overall network stress and depressive symptoms. These data fill several gaps in the social network, stress, and empathy research literature. It also advances the understanding of the stress contagion process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292008-190608/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Brownfields Redevelopment in the Rejuvenation of an Older Industrial City: A Case Study of Two Successful Brownfields Reuse Projects in Baltimore, Maryland</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Gregory William</field><field name="description">The industrialized world is littered with tens of thousands of acres of vacant, decaying, and often contaminated industrial and commercial sites.

This thesis investigates federal and state brownfields policies and reviews contemporary brownfields literature and through a case study approach, it explains how state and federal policies created a climate conducive to brownfields redevelopment in Baltimore, Maryland. By analyzing two successful Baltimore projects, the research shows how the reuse of brownfields had a positive ripple-effect that helped precipitate neighborhood-level investment and revitalization. To help clarify the intricacies often associated with the reuse of brownfields, documentation on financing mechanisms, tax incentives, and state-level Voluntary Cleanup Program application materials are analyzed and described. The impact of the two case study sites on surrounding neighborhoods is researched quantitatively by comparing citywide tax assessed values, real property sales records, and building permit data. The datasets were collected for three years (1995, 2001, and 2007) each representing a distinct time period in Baltimores recent history of brownfield redevelopment. Lastly, to help establish comparable rates of neighborhood investment, this thesis uses location quotients based on building permit applications. The quotients compare Baltimores citywide building activity to building activity in neighborhoods with reclaimed brownfield sites.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292008-201641/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FIELD METHOD EFFICACY TO DETECT MEDIUM AND LARGE MAMMAL PRESENCE NEAR ROADWAYS AT VAIL PASS, COLORADO</field><field name="creator">Bonaker, Paige</field><field name="description">Highways and interstates cause habitat fragmentation and loss, with considerable impacts to wildlife. Interstate 70 is a major transportation route cutting through one of the only remaining forested connections for wildlife moving through the southern Rockies. To alleviate its potential barrier effect, the Colorado Department of Transportation is proposing to build a wildlife bridge on I-70 just west of Vail Pass. This study is aimed at testing which field techniques are most effective at documenting species presence in order to develop an appropriate long term monitoring strategy for this area. Four sampling methods are compared (track transect surveys, scat transect surveys, hair snares, and remotely-triggered camera surveys) during a baited and unbaited study session on Shrine Pass Road near I-70. Data from the baited sessions was used to determine how well each method documents species presence based on time, money and accuracy of identification. In addition, data from the baited session was compared to data from the unbaited session to see if there is any benefit to using a lure. I conclude that no method is free from bias and care should be taken to develop the most robust study design. Though cameras tend to detect the greatest degree of species richness, they frequently fail to detect several species. The effectiveness of cameras can largely be increased by supplementing them with other monitoring techniques. Considering budget and time restraints, I recommend using snow tracking in the winter months, and if at all feasible, scat surveys throughout the year.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292008-214453/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinvention in the Line of Death: A Reconsideration of Geoffrey Hill's Commemorative Verse</field><field name="creator">Bartch, Michael Christopher</field><field name="description">This paper considers the embodied ethics of Geoffrey Hills poetic practice. Hill stages his engagement with poetry through the idioms, images, tropes, and diction of the literary tradition. Through this pragmatic rehearsal of the language of the dead, Hills poetry projects the tradition into the present. Hill resists the ethical entrapments of appropriative poetry through his insistence upon the brute physicality of atrocity and through a rigorous (for both poet and reader) formal difficulty. Hills practice refuses to console after the models of Peter Sacks, Jahan Ramazani, or John Vickery. Instead, concerned with modernitys disconnectedness, Hills poetry returns us to the presence of the dead, to their ritual and language. Alternatively, because Hills subjects are historical atrocities, rather than natural occurrences, the sort of communal consolation that the elegy traditionally offered would be inappropriate to Hills concerns. These atrocities are, most frequently, instances of human violence (the Holocaust, the Battle of Towton, the Wars of the Roses, etc.) and, for this reason, they do not lend themselves to the consolations of natural cycles of death and rebirth. Since they were often committed in the name of religion, Christian transcendence is similarly questionable, as are other consolatory transcendences. These conventional modes of consolation being denied, Hills poetry reconnects us with the dead through the formal devices and techniques of the historical institution of poetry. Through the rigorous engagement with and sacrificial making of poetry, Hill attempts to redeem tradition and history for the present.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292009-093331/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF SAMPLING DESIGNS FOR MEASURING ABUNDANCE OF UNDERSTORY PLANTS AFTER FOREST RESTORATION</field><field name="creator">Abrahamson, Ilana</field><field name="description">Accurate estimation of the responses of understory plants to natural and anthropogenic disturbance is essential for understanding efficacy and non-target effects of management and restoration activities. However, ability to assess changes in abundance of understory plants that result from disturbance may be hampered by inappropriate sampling methodologies. Conventional methods for sampling understory plants may be robust for common, well-distributed species, but may fail to adequately characterize the abundance of less-common species, which are often the taxa of management concern. I tested conventional and novel approaches to sampling understory plants to determine their efficacy (in terms of number of replicates and time required) for quantifying abundance of plants of varying frequency and spatial heterogeneity on three control and three thinned-and-burned treatment units located within the western Montana block of the Fire and Fire Surrogates Project (FFS) a large-scale investigation of the effects of fuel-hazard reduction treatments on a variety of ecosystem components. In each treatment unit, I used four sampling methods (modified Whittaker plots, Daubenmire transects, point line intercept transects, and strip adaptive cluster sampling) to estimate the cover of 24 understory species that vary in abundance. Compared to Daubenmire and point line intercept transects, modified Whittaker plots estimated cover with the lowest variances and, consequently, for the majority (67%) of species required the smallest sample sizes to accurately measure cover. However, this greater sampling efficiency was offset by increased time required to sample. For species grouped by growth-form and for common species, all three conventional sampling designs (i.e. Daubenmire transects, modified Whittaker plots, and point line intercept transects) were capable of estimating cover with a 50% relative margin of error with reasonable sample sizes (3-36 plots or transects for growth-form groups; 8-14 for common species); however, increasing the precision to 25% relative margin of error required sampling sizes that may be logistically infeasible (11-143 plots or transects for growth-form groups; 28-54 for common species). In addition, all three designs required enormous sample sizes to estimate cover of non-native species as a group (29-60 plots or transects) and of individual less-common species (62-118 plots or transects), even with 50% relative margin of error. Strip adaptive cluster sampling was the only method tested that efficiently sampled less-common species: for Cirsium arvense, an invasive non-native plant, adaptive sampling required five times fewer replicates than needed for modified Whittaker plots and 20 times less than for Daubenmire or point line intercept transects. My findings suggest that conventional designs may not be effective for accurately estimating the abundance of newly establishing, non-native plants as a group or of the majority of forest understory plants, which are characterized by low abundance and spatial aggregation. Novel methods such as strip adaptive cluster sampling should be considered in investigations for which cover of these species is a primary response variable.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Ecosystem and Conservation Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05292009-123224/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No Hay Guerra y No Hay Dinero There is No War, and There is No Money: A Case Study of the Organic Coffee and Ecotourism Programs of UCA Miraflor, Nicaragua</field><field name="creator">Gutierrez, Jeffrey Alan</field><field name="description">In the face of persisting unequal relations between the global North and South, what strategies can rural Southern peasants use to ensure the protection of their livelihoods and resources?

On an ad hoc basis, it has been shown that public participation improves the durability and sustainability of plans and decisions; it increases the technical, consensus-building, and decision-making capacity of the public; it increases levels of trust; and it improves relationships between agency personnel and members of the public. Despite the proliferation of these new tools and strategies and their successful implementation, innovative and inclusive public participation methods have still not become widely integrated into the natural resources planning and administrative decision-making processes of federal agencies. Utilizing the Bureau of Land Management's Western Oregon Plan Revision process as a case study, this paper considers barriers to the regular inclusion of innovative and inclusive public participation methods in agency's planning and decision-making processes and provides some prescriptions for overcoming those barriers. Through analysis of this case study, I identify eight potential roadblocks to integrating innovative forms of public participation in natural resources planning and decision-making, including: 1) political context, 2) the purpose and need of the planning effort, 3) false expectations for public involvement, 4) geographic scope of the planning area, 5) the plan timeline, 6) federal budgetary pressure, 7) agency culture and individual attitudes towards public participation, and 8) the limitations of leadership</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302007-073835/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Free living nitrogen-fixation in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests in western Montana</field><field name="creator">Burgoyne, Tricia</field><field name="description">Nitrogen (N) is a primary limiting nutrient in all ecosystems. Therefore, a thorough understanding of N cycling processes in forest ecosystems is required to minimize N losses to fire, harvesting, and other forms of land management. The influence of fire, fire exclusion and forest restoration treatments on non-symbiotic N-fixation in the forest ecosystem has been poorly studied. Over the past 100 years, fire has been greatly excluded from low elevation, fire maintained forests as a result of active fire suppression as well as land management activities that create discontinuities in landscape fire patterns. Previous studies have shown this activity to inhibit recolonization of sites by symbiotic N-fixing plant species. The lack of these important N fixing species may make non-symbiotic, free-living N fixing bacteria a more important source for N recovery in these forest ecosystems following disturbance. Recent studies also suggest that free-living N-fixing bacteria colonizing decomposing woody roots have the capacity to fix large amounts of N. The purpose of these studies was to investigate the effect of fire, fire exclusion, and forest restoration on the N contribution of non-symbiotic N-fixing bacteria (colonizing soil, woody roots, and soil crusts) to the forest ecosystem and how their contribution compares to symbiotic N-fixers in Western Montana. Studies were conducted in the laboratory and at numerous field sites throughout western Montana. In order to determine the N-fixation activity of organisms in these systems, we used the acetylene reduction technique. Neither time since fire, nor restoration treatment had any direct influence on free living N-fixation in soil or woody roots. Moisture and N availability were the potent drivers of free living N-fixation in western Montana. Nitrogen-fixation rates were low in decomposing woody roots in these ecosystems and woody roots do not contribute a significant amount of N to low elevation ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests in western Montana. Free-living N-fixing bacteria in soils were found to make a significant, yet modest N contribution to the forest ecosystem. Nitrogen demand by trees and shrubs are being maintained by residual soil organic N, symbiotic N fixation, and wet and dry N deposition in the Inland Northwest</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecosystem and Conservation Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302007-085002/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Six Stories</field><field name="creator">Coffield, Tim</field><field name="description">no abstract</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302007-110940/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/AIDS AND CONSERVATION AGENCY CAPACITY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA: PERCEPTIONS OF CRITICAL IMPACTS, BARRIERS, AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES</field><field name="creator">Cash, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">The HIV/AIDS pandemic permeates all aspects of southern African civil society including the ability of organizations to practice conservation.

Research goals include: (1) identifying perceptions of the impacts of HIV/AIDS on workforce capacity; (2) elucidating barriers to addressing these impacts; and (3) exploring mitigation strategies. Data collection involved two stages: (1) semi-structured interviews of managers and scientists (n=23) to better understand impacts and barriers; and (2) a panel of key experts (n=30) within southern African conservation agencies ranked impacts according to their perceived severity, using an iterative, Delphi approach. Impacts identified include loss of experience-based knowledge, difficulty in planning for the future, and increases in human resource costs. Barriers to addressing these impacts include gender issues, lack of awareness, staff housing and stigma associated with the disease. Mitigation strategies must address impacts and barriers within a southern Africa context.

Some work, however, suggests that asexual reproduction can also be advantageous. One situation when asexual reproduction provides an advantage is when colonizing a new range (Bakers law), as in plant invasions. This study investigated the population structure of the invasive plant Hieracium aurantiacum. H. aurantiacum is an apomict producing much of its seed asexually and has become a common invasive in North America and New Zealand. The genetic diversity of H. aurantiacum was assessed over its invasive ranges in the Eastern and Western North America, as well as one location from its native range in the Czech Republic. Using AFLP analysis (with 45 loci), I generated genetic profiles of 225 H. aurantiacum and 60 individuals from 6 other Hieracium species (some native to and some introduced to North America) for comparison. Virtually no genetic variability was found in H. aurantiacum (clonal diversity was 0.035). Other Hieracium species, however, showed a range of diversity, showing clonal diversities from 0.154 to 1.0. One H. aurantiacum genotype dominated the sampled range (G1, in 51 of 53 sampled locations) and was identical to the sample from the Czech Republic. Two other genotypes were found in restricted ranges (G2 and G3). One was a population recently derived from nursery stock, and the other may represent another introduction or a mutated clonal line each differed from each other and G1 at only two loci. It is quite possible that virtually all H. aurantiacum worldwide are clones. Despite this plants lack of genetic variation, it is able to grow over a wide invaded range, which may be due to phenotypic plasticity in fitness-related traits. Many theories about invasion success involve genetic diversity in invading populations to provide the necessary flexibility to flourish in a variety of habitats in an invaded range. In asexual invaders tending towards low genetic diversity, however, phenotypic plasticity of fitness-related traits is a more likely possibility.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302007-121438/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Markedness Approach to Epenthesis in Arabic Speakers' L2 English</field><field name="creator">Alezetes, Elizabeth Dawn</field><field name="description">This thesis explores how Cairene Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, and Najdi Arabic speakers deal with complex syllable margins in their L2 English. While previous studies have attributed Cairene and Iraqi speakers pronunciations of English syllables that contain consonant clusters to transfer of allowed syllable structures from their native language, this thesis illustrates that the universal markedness of consonant clusters could be a factor that motivates L2 speakers to simplify complex syllable margins. Universal markedness has to do with the frequency that a structure occurs cross-linguistically. Languages that allow complex syllable margins, such as English, also contain simple syllable margins. Many languages contain simple syllable margins but do not allow complex syllable margins; thus, complex syllable margins are more marked than simple syllable margins. A markedness approach to second language phonology would consider the markedness of complex syllable margins to be an important factor in whether L2 learners have difficulty with this structure. By using Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993,McCarthy and Prince 1993), this thesis illustrates the role that markedness plays in Cairene Arabic, Iraqi Arabic, and Najdi Arabic. This thesis also presents the results of a study of L2 English data produced by native speakers of Najdi Arabic and uses the data to support a markedness approach for accounting for syllable errors in L2 English.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302007-151801/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Split Rock Sky</field><field name="creator">McMackin, Jason</field><field name="description">This is the first section of a novel in progress.

Of this, only negative 19 to 11 cm is attributed to the largest ice masses on the planet, the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Over the last decade, dramatic activity in the outlet glaciers of Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula raise the possibility that these large ice sheets will have a much greater contribution to sea level rise over the next century than was predicted by the IPCC. Recent studies have shown these areas are exhibiting decadal scale changes in response to climate forcings, whereas IPCC models show that ice is not responsive to climate change over such short periods of time. Many believe the IPCC type models fail to show short term climate responses due to the simplifications they make to ice sheet mechanics. Here, we develop a higher-order model -- a new ice sheet model which contains all relevant flow physics. In order to gauge our progress, we perform a verification of our model around a structured set of experiments. The analysis reveals our model is performing well over a range of different scenarios.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302008-101724/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gifford Pinchot's Photographic Aesthetic</field><field name="creator">Magill, Carlie Shaw</field><field name="description">Gifford Pinchots aesthetic developed in childhood and combined the pictorial considerations of the Hudson River School with the use philosophy of early landscape architecture and the format of early western survey photographers.

A case-study is built for the aforementioned processes having occurred in Moroccan Arabic through fulfillment of Southworths (1971) two principles for determining the credibility of a pidginization and/or creolization claim: (1) That the required socio-linguistic frameworks are in place, and (2) that the linguistic effects of such processes are evident. Moroccan Arabic is analyzed alongside other languages that have undergone the processes of pidginization and creolization in its socio-diglossic history as well as in the linguistic features that are common to most pidgin and creole languages (e.g. transformed TMA system, SVO word order, analytic genitive, periphrastic interrogative, indefinite article).

These Indians came to be known as the gen&#237;zaros and, through the process scholars call ethnogenesis, developed their own identity by incorporating Hispano-Christian cultural practices while preserving their native ways. The gen&#237;zaros were products of a widespread and lucrative trade in Plains Indian captives and, as such, they represented various tribes, including Apaches, Navajos, Comanches, Kiowas, Pawnees, Utes and Wichitas. The term gen&#237;zaro emerged as a caste label during the Spanish colonial period and usually refers to members of these Plains Indian groups who were captured in the Indian wars and raiding expeditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and in turn sold to New Mexicans as servants to be instructed in Hispanic customs and baptized as Christians. The gen&#237;zaro experience in New Mexico was an ongoing practice of cultural reinvention in the interest of self-preservationa practice consistent with the cultural survival and legacy of other Native Americans in the region. As individuals, gen&#237;zaros underwent social and cultural transformations upon leaving their native communities and entering Hispanic society through servitude. The extent to which these individual experiences produced a shared gen&#237;zaro consciousness and legacy to survive and become a distinctly gen&#237;zaro culture is the story that unfolds here.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302008-122456/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Styles and Themes Supporting a Feminist Perspective in 'Verfuehrungen.' by Marlene Streeruwitz</field><field name="creator">Belz, Elisabeth Helen Rosemarie</field><field name="description">This paper discusses the themes and styles Marlene Streeruwitz uses to support a feminist perspective.

In the first part of this study, I examined the influence of four environmental variables (flood frequency, microtopography, light availability, and soil texture) and spatial heterogeneity on riparian plant community structure in seven study areas along mountain streams in western Montana, USA. Multivariate and spatial statistics were used to determine the relative strength of each set of factors and their interactions in explaining riparian plant community structure. Flooding influenced vegetation characteristics by an indirect pathway through microtopography in all study areas, whereas the direct influence of flooding was found commonly only in three study areas. Other consistent direct influences included light (60%) and space (87%). Direct and indirect influences of flood frequency through microtopography, and the direct influences of light and vegetation patch structure should be included in predictive models of riparian plant community structure in mountain streams. Boundary analysis showed that microtopography was an important factor for boundary maintenance of riparian plant communities. In the second part of the study, the effective flood frequency was determined initially by partial Mantel tests between inundation extent associated with each flood frequency and plant communities, and the results were compared to floristic characteristics derived from DCA and Indicator Species Analysis. Flood frequencies ranging from one to eight years were most strongly associated with the understory and overall plant community structure, whereas overstory communities were influenced by both frequent (&#161;&#220; 9 year) and large infrequent (&#161;&#221;35 year) floods. Riparian plant communities in mountain streams are mostly influenced by frequent flooding but large floods are also important for maintaining spatial heterogeneity.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302008-155627/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Looking more deeply into the Link between Art and Place within the Salish Tribal Culture of Northwest Montana</field><field name="creator">Davis, Nathan E.</field><field name="description">In northwest Montana, there exists a rich tribal culture and vibrant physical environment. The Salish tribal culture that exists in this environment holds an immense knowledge of the landscape that surrounds it, and the Salish people are intimately tied to this place. They have unique and fascinating culturally informed ways of looking at and interpreting the landscape. It is evident in their artistic traditions and expressions, both in the past and in the present. This research examines the importance of local knowledge in indigenous communities. The intent of this research is to identify links between Salish art and sense of place. The purpose of this research is to develop a curriculum guide that addresses the role art plays in establishing and expressing a sense of authentic human attachment and true belonging in a special or unique place. The curriculum guide will focus upon the artistic traditions and expressions of the interior Salish tribes of northwestern Montanas Flathead Indian Reservation. This study will take a particular interest in exploring how art has changed and how Native artists creatively re-imagine themselves in order to reclaim traditional strength and voice. There will be a focus on the Indian Education for All Laws and Policies, giving teachers an understanding of the policies and laws that affect all people in Montana. The basic research question being asked is: What is the relationship between Salish artistic expressions and sense of place? To answer this question we must develop a good understanding of art, sense of place, and the relationship between art and sense of place. Art and place both have a past, present, and future. The recognition of beauty is found not only in art but also in sense of place. Place is a center of meaning and the same can be said of art. Place and art are both different things to different people. Art and place can be animated, but both express only what their animators enable them to say. Both place and art can only give back to one equally as much as the amount of thought, feeling, and attention which one has devoted to them. Art, as well as place, is animated by the people who attend to it. So, even in total stillness, places or works of art can speak to one. People have relationships with places. These relationships are expressed in numerous ways. Some are expressed through political ritual, religious ceremonies, myth, prayer, music, dance, and architecture. Art can be the place where the tangible and the mythical become the same. Through artistic traditions and expressions conducted daily, monthly, seasonally, or annually, places and their meanings are continually rewoven into the fabric of our life. Art and place both change, while at the same time stay the same.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302008-172318/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Far Toward the Bottom</field><field name="creator">Kruse, Megan Nicole</field><field name="description">Short Story Collection</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05302010-152650/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Wars of the Romani, a Flemish Tapestry From the Late Sixteenth Century</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Theodore Brooks</field><field name="description">Among the treasures of the Montana Museum of Art and Culture is a lovely and elaborate work of art entitled Wars of the Romani, a Flemish tapestry woven in the last third of the 16th century. It is a large weaving, 10 x 15, portraying two armies intertwined in merciless combat. The specific subject matter of Wars of the Romani is unknown, but a standard displaying the Roman eagle held aloft in the background indicates the presence of the Roman legions. The tapestry displays rushing horsemen mounted on vigorous horses, marching spearmen, and supine warriors, imagery common to Flemish battle tapestries from the last quarter of the sixteenth century. Framing the battle scene is a grotesque style border composed of gods placed within whimsical filigree architectural pavilions interwoven with fanciful decoration and mythical beasts. Wars of the Romanis Mannerist battle scene offers a view into the pictorial trends of the late Renaissance and displays the energy of the tumultuous era in which it was woven.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05312007-134933/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT OF FECAL DNA SAMPLING METHODS TO ASSESS GENETIC POPULATION STRUCTURE OF GREATER YELLOWSTONE BISON</field><field name="creator">Gardipee, Florence Marie</field><field name="description">The bison (Bison bison) of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) and Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) represent two of only three remaining populations of plains bison that have no evidence of hybridization with cattle. Therefore, these bison are an important source for ecological and genetic restoration of wild bison. Little is known regarding genetic population structure and gene flow among the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) bison herds. I evaluated the feasibility of fecal DNA sampling for genetic analyses of wild bison populations. I used matched blood and fecal samples from eight radio-collared bison from Hayden Valley breeding group (YNP), and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of four microsatellite loci to assess amplification success and genotyping error rates. The amplification success rate was 92% and the genotyping error rate was 12% on average across all individuals, and loci. Exclusion of two poor quality samples from data analyses increased amplification success to 97%, and reduced the genotyping error rate to 4%. I PCR amplified a 470 bp mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment for sequencing, and successfully identified haplotypes for120 individuals. The error rate for mtDNA sequencing was 0.0005 nucleotide mis-incorporations across all samples. Sequencing and RFLP analysis of mtDNA control region from 179 fecal samples collected over two consecutive seasons was conducted to evaluate population structure among YNP breeding groups, and between GTNP and YNP bison populations. I found significant genetic distinction between YNP and GTNP bison populations (FST = 0.191, p &lt; 0.001). The differences in haplotype frequencies between Hayden Valley and Lamar Valley breeding groups were highly significant (FST = 0.367, p &lt; 0.001), and nearly two times greater than between GTNP and YNP thus providing evidence for at least two genetically distinct breeding groups within YNP. Differences between breeding groups remained significant even though haplotype frequencies were different between years within Hayden Valley (FST = 0.054, p &lt; 0.05). The techniques and protocols developed have allowed high amplification success, low genotyping and sequencing error rates. This study demonstrated that non-invasive fecal DNA sampling is feasible for bison, and detected fine-scale population genetic structure in among GYA bison, suggesting female philopatry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05312007-141703/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of L-carnitine in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia</field><field name="creator">Rau, Thomas Fredrick</field><field name="description">Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) represents an intractable clinical condition that lacks an effective treatment and results in blindness, cerebral palsy, and cognitive deficits. A primary mechanism of cell death induced by neonatal HI is mitochondrial dysfunction leading to metabolic crisis and apoptosis. L-carnitine (LCAR) is an endogenous compound that transports fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for metabolism, buffers endogenous acyl-coA pools and improves the health and efficiency of the mitochondria. In light of the mitochondrial dysfunction observed after HI we hypothesized treatment with LCAR would reduce cell death after HI. Using a novel rat hippocampal slice culture model we observed a decrease in cell death in RHSC treated with 5mM LCAR for 2 hours prior to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Under the same conditions we observed an LCAR induced decrease in both necrosis and mitochondrially-mediated apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism for these data we studied the effect of LCAR on reactive oxygen species (ROS) before and after OGD. We observed a decrease in superoxide and H2O2 in RHSC treated with LCAR and exposed to OGD. In further experiments we observed LCAR treatment increased the expression and activity of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and catalase prior to OGD and this effect resulted in decreased cell death after OGD. In addition to increased (ROS) scavenging, we observed an LCAR mediated increase in levels of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP-2). In a series of experiments we observed a correlation between UCP-2 expression, the reversible modulation of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a decrease in cell death after OGD. These observations taken together suggest LCAR decreases cell death in RHSC after OGD by increasing ROS scavenging and UCP-2 expression in the mitochondria prior to OGD.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuroscience</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-05312007-151334/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lake Unloosed</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Julie Ellen</field><field name="description">Poetry</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06012009-102336/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Loss of Play in Organized Youth Sports</field><field name="creator">Jensen, Audrey Lea</field><field name="description">All individuals have an innate need to create and explore. They explore creativity through free and spontaneous play. This free play is essential in cognitive development. In organized youth sports children no longer have this opportunity to freely play. Athletics are regimented and restricted in ways that do not allow children to personally experience the sport at an intrinsic level. Young athletes are taught at an early age the significance of extrinsic rewards and motivators. Because of these extrinsic rewards young athletes lose their desire to explore the sport on a more intimate level. They perform robotically the skills and tasks set before for them. All individuality is lost in a world commanding conformity. In this process there are three stages that young athletes go through in losing their desire to play: deprival of pleasure, denial of inquiry, and deprivation of self. These stages are detrimental to the childs ability to deeply connect with athletics. The Loss of Play in Organized Youth Sports is increasing in a world filled with meticulous coaching methods. If we do not change the way childrens athletics are conducted, future generations will lose the personal relationship with sports in the future. The solution is to stop making sports focused on adults, and change them to be child-centered. Allow the children to compete in a world where they are free to explore and learn.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06012009-132250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cenozoic Evolution of the Gold Creek Basin, Western Montana: Mapping and Documenting the Geology of the Rock Creek Lake 7.5' USGS Quadrangle</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Chelsea McRaven</field><field name="description">This thesis presents results from 1:24,000 scale surface mapping and related analysis of geology within the Rock Creek Lake 7.5 USGS Quadrangle in western Montana. The purpose of this study is to 1) document the Cenozoic structural evolution and sedimentary fill record associated with tectonic development of the northern Flint Creek Range and, in particular, the Anaconda metamorphic core complex and 2) determine the existence and extent of Pleistocene glacial deposition in the study area. Gneissic mylonitic granodiorite along the southeastern contact of the Royal Stock intrusion indicates the Anaconda metamorphic core complex detachment zone trends through the center of the map area but diminishes to the north. Synthetic top-to-the-east normal faults throughout the study area are interpreted as joining the main detachment at depth. Granitic and metamorphic rock fragments observed during provenance studies of sandstones and conglomerates indicate the initial opening of the Gold Creek basin was contemporaneous with the unroofing of the Anaconda metamorphic core complex. The upper Renova Formation observed in the study area is equivalent to the upper Renova Cabbage Patch beds best developed in the Flint Creek basin to the west and indicate primarily lacustrine, fluviatile, and palustrine depositional environments. Quaternary glacial deposits attributed to the Pinedale Glaciation consist of narrow, sharp-crested moraines (mean crest width of 5m) with high distal slope angles (average 30&#176;) and primarily consist of relatively unweathered granitic boulders. Deposits interpreted as reflecting the Bull Lake Glaciation are characterized by wide, round-crested moraines (mean crest width of 50-100m) and low distal slope angles (average 10-20&#176;), with little exposure of quartzite and weathered granite boulders at the surface. Formation of the Gold Creek basin was influenced by Cenozoic relaxation of Cretaceous thrust faults, extension from the Anaconda metamorphic core complex, and dextral transtension along the Lewis and Clark Lineament.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06012009-172702/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Socio-Ecological Factors that Impact Sustainable Management of the lake Bosomtwe Basin in Ghana</field><field name="creator">Nyantakyi-Frimpong, Hanson</field><field name="description">This study sought to investigate the social-ecological factors that hold back sustainability efforts in the Lake Bosomtwe basin in Ghana, how these factors change over time, and what determines their ability to absorb disturbances in either their ecological or social domains. A mixed methods approach was utilized, using primary, secondary, and tertiary literature; unstructured interviews with thirty-one respondents; transect walks, observations and photography. A causal-chain analysis was used to illustrate and trace out the ways in which identified factors act and interact to degrade the lake's ecosystem. The study finds that factors constraining sustainability efforts and exacerbating environmental problems in the lake basin include rapid population growth, high levels of poverty, and weak lake basin governance systems. Further aggravating the problem is irreverence for traditional resource management practices which have been a useful tool in managing resources in the past, and changes in climate variables of rainfall and temperature, thus affecting lake water levels. Systems of interventions necessary to address these problems are noted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06012010-114053/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression-Era Coloma: A World-Systems Study of Mining and Daily Life Experiences in a Reoccupied Montana Ghost Town.</field><field name="creator">Woody, Benjamin</field><field name="description">Anthropologically based studies are underdeveloped on the subject of people living in Montana during the Great Depression.

The first is that /s/ in complex onsets, e.g., stsiki, another, is extrasyllabic, and that a moraic /s/ reduces the markedness of these extrasyllabic segments. The second is that because /s/ is moraic, it can act as a syllable nucleus, which explains why the distribution of geminate /ss/ is more similar to long vowels than to geminate consonants. In Blackfoot, clusters of more than two consonants occur only with /s/, and clusters of more than three consonants occur only with geminate /ss/. The Blackfoot syllable seems to be overwhelmingly simple, with /ss/ clusters being the only outliers. While all other geminates occur between vowels, geminate /ss/ often occurs before, after, or between other consonants. This thesis aims to make three specific contributions: (i) to describe the distribution of /s/ in Blackfoot, (ii) to propose that a non-vocoid may be inherently moraic, and (iii) to introduce the PROSODICSEQUENCING constraint, which explains the tendency for onsets to be non-moraic, and predicts that light CVC syllables will be less marked than heavy CVC syllables.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06032009-114400/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salman Rushdie's Fiction in a Global Perspective: Hybridity and Fundamentalism in The Satanic Verses and The Moor's Last Sigh</field><field name="creator">Henry, Matthew</field><field name="description">In this study, I examine Salman Rushdies fiction within the critical framework of globalization studies. In particular, I focus on The Satanic Verses (1988) and The Moors Last Sigh (1995) in order to elucidate the specific ways in which Rushdie engages the promises and pitfalls of cultural globalization. In my introduction, I lay necessary important epistemological groundwork through my examination of hybridity and fundamentalism within a globalized context. Both terms, I suggest, describe significant responses to, and conditions brought about by, an increase in cultural contact and exchange in an increasingly interconnected world. In Chapter 1, I delineate the ways in which Rushdie valorizes hybridity in The Satanic Verses. Not only does Rushdie promote hybridity as a capable of assuaging the problems of migrancy, he makes his point through a sustained critique of the dogmatic and fundamentalist propensities of religion, especially Islam. In my second chapter, I explore The Moors Last Sigh for evidence of an ideological revision, on the part of Rushdie, regarding hybridity. His first major literary work following the Rushdie affairan event precipitated by his treatment of Islam in The Satanic VersesThe Moors Last Sigh is in many ways less optimistic than its predecessor. However, I argue that Rushdie does not entirely dispense with his original claims; rather, he is wiser to the hazards of hybridity and multiculturalism, and he deploys modern India as test case for the ways in which these conditions are rendered vulnerable to misappropriation by Hindu fundamentalist regimes and, ultimately, the driving forces of global capitalism. In my conclusion, I briefly investigate a larger tendency, on the part of Rushdie, to resist totalizing views of the world. It is this tendency, I argue, that firmly situates Rushdie as an advocate of hybridity, but it also suggests that Rushdies search for coherence is actually quite similar to the main impetus for religious fundamentalism: an attempt to establish, or restore, a specific worldview to preeminence.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06032010-140534/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of The University of Montana Forensic Case 29</field><field name="creator">Haak, Daniel James</field><field name="description">The application of non-metric forensic anthropological techniques produces results that are sometimes not always scientifically valid.

This study was designed to collect long-term understory tree growth data under a broad range of conditions, with the objective of separately evaluating the effects of site quality, overstory retention, and understory competition levels on tree height growth. After four years, mean periodic annual height growth increment (PAI) for 1,708 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and 1,286 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) were analyzed from 21 research sites across a gradient of site productivity and stand conditions. At each research site, seven 0.2 ha plots were established under homogeneous overstory and understory conditions, with subsequent herbicide treatment of randomly selected plots to create a range of understory competition levels. Research sites were categorized into three site quality classes (Low, Medium, High) based on plant associations, with sites ranging from warm dry Douglas-fir/Pinegrass to more moist Grand fir/Twinflower. Reducing competing understory vegetation significantly improved PAI for ponderosa pine trees in Low and Medium sites (p&lt;0.001), and for Douglas-fir in Low sites (p&lt;0.06). PAI in untreated control plots was 42% - 59% lower for PIPO and 23% - 34% lower for Douglas-fir, relative to plots with multiple herbicide treatments. Initial size and overstory density were the most influential variables explaining growth in the linear regression analyses. Tree level analysis for initial tree size displayed more predictive value for Douglas-fir (R2 = 48%) than for pine (R2 = 29%). Plot level overstory variables explained more variation for pine (R2 =44%) than for Douglas-fir (R2 =25%). Multiple regression analyses produced models using the two prominent variables, with additional significant variables (i.e. sapling competition index, vegetation volumes, others) to explain 57%, 59%, and 60% of the variation in PAI for pine in the Low, Medium, and High sites, respectively. Models for Douglas-fir explained 50%, 82%, and 60% of the variation for PAI in the same classes. PAI rates in seedling sized conifers showed more sensitivity to increased basal area retention than larger trees, suggesting that understory tree size ought to be considered when planning silvicultural treatments. Reducing overstory to levels to between 5-10 m2-ha-1 can achieve partial retention objectives if PAI losses of 7%-26% for pine and 26% - 28% for Douglas-fir are acceptable by the landowner (compared to more full removal harvest). Results suggest that together understory vegetation and overstory density can significantly affect the rate of height growth in these species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06042009-213107/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-term effects of wildfire on Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep habitat ecology</field><field name="creator">Greene, Lacey</field><field name="description">We studied changes in vegetation and habitat selection by endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis candensis sierrae; hereafter Sierra bighorn) for 2 years following wildfire on winter ranges in eastern California. We hypothesized that wildfire would change both forage availability and predation risk. Green forage biomass on Sierra bighorn winter ranges rebounded quickly from wildfire. Within 2 years green forage biomass was equal in burned and unburned areas, although total forage biomass was greater in unburned areas. Plants in the burn had 3% greater crude protein but equivalent digestibility and phenology. Forage composition in burned areas was forb dominated compared with unburned areas that were shrub dominated. Visibility, a measure of predation risk, was 9% greater in burned areas at a 5 m radii compared with unburned areas. We found no change in fecal nitrogen between Sierra bighorn in burned and unburned areas but there was a shift to higher diet composition of forbs in the burn. We evaluated Sierra bighorn resource selection using seasonal resource selection functions that included spatiotemporal models of forage biomass and spatial models of predation risk by cougars (Puma concolor), the main predator of Sierra bighorn. In the first year post-wildfire, Sierra bighorn increased selection for new growth herbaceous biomass in response to the reduced biomass caused by wildfire. While wildfire initially reduced total forage biomass it also created pockets of the highest new forb biomass in areas of high cougar use. These pockets attracted Sierra bighorn causing an increase in overlap with cougars in winter 2008. Sierra bighorn showed consistent selection to be near escape terrain and remained closer to escape terrain in areas of high cougar use compared to areas with low cougar use. By spring 2008 and winter and spring of 2009 Sierra bighorn strongly selected total forage biomass where cougar use was low and in areas of high cougar use, Sierra bighorn avoided total forage biomass. As a result Sierra bighorn overlap with cougar use was reduced. We advise management to consider the effects of fire on both forage availability and predation when implementing prescribed burns to benefit ungulates.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06042010-115655/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ruffled Feathers: Shared narratives in the sage-grouse management conflict in Sublette County, Wyoming</field><field name="creator">Essen, Maureen A.</field><field name="description">The tense conflict over sage grouse management in the West, where livelihoods have been pitted against the possibility of an endangered species listing, has been ongoing for many years and has been described as being as tense as the spotted owl conflict in the Northwest in the 1990s. This research is designed to highlight the different frames or narratives within the sage grouse debate in Sublette County, Wyoming while exploring a resurging research methodology. Q methodology, a method intended to identify distinct viewpoints within a sample was employed to understand the different narratives among these conflict parties. The Q method suggested three distinct viewpoints or knowledge communities existed within the sample: ultra locals, classic biologists and harmonizers. Ultra locals largely consisted of ranchers (75%) and others dependent on the land for their livelihood and showed a strong preference for local county management that included local information. The narratives of the classic biologists, a group consisting solely of biologists working for agencies, consulting firms and conservation organizations, preferred that science and research point the way to a solution. Finally, agency biologists and energy industry employees made up the final group identified, the harmonizers. This group favored working with all stakeholders to work together to build a solution. A number of areas of agreement including the lack of support for an ESA listing, and disagreement such as the role of predators on sage grouse populations were highlighted. To move forward on the conflict, this research suggests that instead of pursuing issues that may only serve to increase the conflict, such as issues of predators or sources of knowledge, a path forward may be found in merging the livelihood interests of ranchers with the preservation interests of biologists. Results also show that the Q method was helpful in pinpointing distinct viewpoints on sage grouse management in Sublette County; however, without the use of an in-depth interview, the Q method results may have been difficult to clearly and meaningfully interpret.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06042010-155408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of post-exercise environmental temperature on glycogen resynthesis</field><field name="creator">Naperalsky, Michael E.</field><field name="description">Hotter environments can often alter the normal exercises responses of metabolism and work performance compared to exercise in a more neutral condition.

Blood samples were collected at 0, 30, 60, 120, 150, 180, and 240 minutes of recovery for glucose and insulin analysis. Ambient and core temperatures were monitored for the duration of the trial. Expired gas was collected prior to 2- and 4-hour biopsies for calculation of whole-body carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation. Glycogen, core temperature, CHO oxidation, and blood marker values were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Average core temperature was significantly higher in H compared to RT (38.1&#176;C &#177; 0.01&#176; vs. 37.9&#176;C &#177; 0.08&#176;, p&lt;0.05) during recovery. Glycogen was not different at 0 and 2 hours post-exercise. However, at 4 hours post-exercise muscle glycogen was significantly higher in RT vs. H (105 &#177; 28 vs. 88 &#177; 24 mmolkg-1 wet weight, respectively). Blood glucose levels were similar between H and RT for the first two hours, but showed lower values (p&lt;0.05) in RT compared to H at time points 150, 180, and 240 minutes post-exercise. CHO oxidation during recovery was higher in H compared to RT (0.36 &#177; 0.04 g/min vs. 0.22 &#177; 0.03 g/min, respectively, p&lt;0.05), with greater CHO oxidation at 4-hours post-exercise in both trials. Glycogen resynthesis during recovery is impaired in a hot environment, likely due to increased oxidation of CHO instead of synthesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06052009-115319/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public relations in nonprofit organizations: A guide to establishing public relations programs in nonprofit settings</field><field name="creator">Gale, Megan Kate</field><field name="description">Public relations has become an increasingly popular topic in the nonprofit community, and the demand for developing piblic relations as a core competency has increased as well.

One type of artifact collected was writing slate fragments, the topic of this thesis. Why were writing slate fragments found at the Alder Creek camp? An investigation into writing slate in the historical record had to be conducted to address this question. The lack of pertinent research associated with writing slate posed a major obstacle, as it has been disregarded as a diagnostic artifact in historical archaeological literature. This paper addresses this problem by a history of writing slate and its uses, as well as including a discussion of precursors to writing slate, to provide a context for materials recovered from the Alder Creek site. It was first thought that writing slate was only used in the context of education, as might have provided a means of keeping the children busy during the Donner Partys snowbound experience. However, this research indicates that a number of other activities can be associated with writing slate; including messages and notes, record keeping and accounting, gaming and gambling. The writing slate recovered from the Donner family camp is analyzed here using the results of the historical overview of this material and a cognitive archaeological approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06062008-182026/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative Proof</field><field name="creator">Puerini, Kathryn Margherita</field><field name="description">A collection of poems by Kathryn Puerini.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06072009-204047/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching for the Real McCoy</field><field name="creator">Braman, Carrie Adams</field><field name="description">Masters thesis in Creative Nonfiction Writing</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06082009-130101/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gelatwirl</field><field name="creator">Beilin, Caren</field><field name="description">Gelatwirl is a novel about if there is a cure for childhood, and if gelatin is that cure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06082009-193021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIO/ORGANIC COMPOUND DETECTION USING SODIUM SULFATE MINERALS: IMPLICATIONS IN THE SEARCH FOR LIFE ON MARS AND EUROPA</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Charles Doc</field><field name="description">With the discovery of Na-sulfate minerals (thenardite, mirabilite) on Mars and Europa, recent studies using these minerals have focused on their ability to assist in the detection of biosignatures. On Earth, biotic and biotic processes can assist in the formation and deposition of these minerals. A primary objective of these studies is the detection of bio/organic compounds that may be associated with the mineral. These biosignatures would imply biological involvement during mineral formation. The following research presents a series of natural and synthetic investigations to determine if biological activity is associated with Na-sulfate mineralization, and if these minerals can assist in detecting bio/organic compounds. Evidence for biological activity associated with the formation of Na-sulfate deposits in the basaltic subsurface of Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho was examined by laser desorption Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LD-FTMS), infrared spectroscopy and sulfur isotopic fractionation. These experiments show that bio/organic compounds are likely associated with the secondary Na-sulfate minerals, suggesting biological involvement in the mineralization of these deposits. LD-FTMS results of the synthetic bio/organic-mineral combinations show the potential of Na-sulfate minerals to assist in the detection and identification of bio/organic compounds. These results prove the importance of Na-sulfate minerals for future exploration missions that are likely to use LDMS to search for signs of life in the solar system.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06082010-080302/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining the Ninth Circuit's Clarified Arbitrary and Capricious Standard of Review after Lands Council v.

In order to mitigate the effects that highways have on wildlife, it is important to assess where wildlife appear to be moving in close proximity to the highway. I surveyed for wildlife trails that approached either side of a ~64 km stretch U.S. Highway 2 (US-2) and monitored these trails with remote cameras. Ungulates, especially deer, were the most commonly photographed animals on trails. A limited number of photographs were also taken of coyote, black bear, snowshoe hare, wolf, and cougar. Camera images showed that wildlife tended to use roadside trails during hours of lower traffic volumes. I used multiple logistic regression at three scales (50 m, 250 m, and 500 m) followed by model selection with Akaikes Information Criterion to assess the impacts of certain landscape features on the location of wildlife trails (used) versus randomly generated points (unused). I examined the clustering of wildlife trails and found them to be clustered at all distance scales less than 39 kmwith the strongest clustering occurring at the 5-8 km scales. The 5 km segment of highway with the highest density of trails was located from Milepost (MP) 181-184. Crossing zones were delineated based on a combination of the number of trails, previously identified wildlife crossings, camera incidents-per-day, potential parcels of land for conservation, and highway and railroad structures in a given area (usually a 5 km segment). The results of this study may serve as useful baseline information to the Great Northern Environmental Stewardship Area working group (GNESA) and its partners to help guide future research and mitigation projects in the US-2 corridor.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06092010-100319/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fort Owen: The History and Archaeology of a Contact Period Site in Western Montana</field><field name="creator">Merritt, Donald</field><field name="description">Fort Owen was part of recent historical western expansion into Montana, influencing both the cultural and environmental landscape of the state and the forts own existence. The Fort Owen collection provided the opportunity to research the history and archaeology of Fort Owen as a contact period site and as the first historic-period agricultural center in Montana. Fort Owen provided goods and services to a variety of individuals and was the nexus of settlement for the region for several years during the latter portion of the 19th century. Six goals of this thesis were to: 1) inventory the Fort Owen artifacts and locate all associated excavation and research records; 2) sort, clean, and catalog Fort Owen artifacts that have been collected over the past several decades; 3) examine whether and how a poorly provenienced collection still had significant research value relevant to the study of Fort Owen; 4) use new archaeological excavations to help establish provenience data for unprovenienced artifacts by cross-referencing the new finds with artifacts recovered from the site during past excavations; 5) provide a comprehensive record of all known information relating to Fort Owen in one place and provide copies of that information to relevant repositories; and 6) use the Fort Owen collection to argue that the site is critically important to Montana heritage, inspiring future research related to Fort Owens historical landscape. One of the major steps related to the above goals required synthesizing data from past field notes and related historical resources, including census records, historical accounts, books, and newspaper articles. Here I propose that Fort Owen itselfas well as its unprovenienced collectionhave information potential if examined using a theoretical approach based on Fort Owens historical position within a zone of 19th and early 20th-century cultural interaction in Montanas Bitterroot Valley. In addition, I also argue that applying an interpretive framework of agricultural development to archaeological analysis of Fort Owen reveals a complex set of socioeconomic interactions at local, regional, and even national scales.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06092010-105551/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing cumulative human impacts on northern woodland caribou with traditional ecological knowledge and resource selection functions</field><field name="creator">Polfus, Jean Lieppert</field><field name="description">Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are federally listed and declining across Canada because of the cumulative impacts of human infrastructure development. The Atlin northern mountain herd, in the territory of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation (TRTFN), British Columbia, is less affected by development than southern herds. However, recent low productivity in this herd suggests that the impacts of development (i.e., roads, mines, cabins and towns) may be accumulating. To predict the cumulative impact of human development on the Atlin herd, we developed seasonal resource selection functions (RSF) at 2 spatial scales with data from 10 global positioning system collared caribou. We modeled habitat selection and assessed cumulative effects by estimating the zone of influence (ZOI) around several types of human development. At the landscape and home range scale caribou avoided the ZOI and selected pine-lichen forests in winter and alpine habitats in summer. Approximately 8 and 2% of high quality habitat was lost due to avoidance of current development at the landscape scale in winter and summer, respectively. Future development of access roads to 2 mines would cause a further loss of 1% of high quality habitat. Negotiating the complex political dynamics that surround caribou conservation often requires new approaches to management and recovery planning. The incorporation of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) with Western science could improve efficiency of management decisions and enhance the validity and robustness of ecological inferences. Therefore, we evaluated how well RSF and TEK habitat models predicted current woodland caribou observations and compared the spatial predictions of both modeling approaches. Habitat suitability index models were generated from TEK interviews with TRTFN members. Though comparison of habitat ranks between the 2 models showed spatial discrepancies in some cases, overall, both approaches had high model performance and successfully predicted caribou occurrence. Our results suggest TEK can be used to identify caribou habitat and is a useful approach in northern ecosystems that frequently lack long-term ecological data that are needed to inform management decisions. Combining TEK-based habitat suitability index models with cumulative effects assessments will facilitate recovery goals for woodland caribou across northern Canada.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06102010-144025/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSING THE INFLUENCE OF PARENT/GUARDIAN VARIABLES ON SELECT TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK FACTORS AMONG 10 TO 14 YEAR OLD NORTHERN PLAINS INDIAN YOUTH</field><field name="creator">Ricci, Christiana Lea</field><field name="description">Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a growing health concern among American Indian populations. Many behavioral risk factors for T2DM are influenced by the family unit. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of certain parent/guardian variables on youth type 2 diabetes risk factors. Methods: The parents/guardians of 10-14 year old Northern Plains American Indian youth (n=37) were surveyed regarding their knowledge for physical activity and nutrition, support behaviors for physical activity and nutrition in their youth, and their individual physical activity and nutrition behaviors. Youth variables including physical activity behavior, dietary behavior, and body mass index percentile-for-age (BMI %ile) were also collected. Results: Higher levels of parent/guardian physical activity support were correlated with higher youth BMI %ile (r= 0.433, p=0.013). Parent/guardian nutrition support was also significantly correlated with higher youth BMI %ile as well (r=0.406, p=0.021). Parent/guardian physical activity support and nutrition support were not significantly correlated (p&gt;0.05) with youth physical activity behavior or dietary behavior. Parent/guardian knowledge about physical activity and nutrition was not associated with youth physical activity, youth dietary intake, or youth BMI %ile. Parent/guardian nutrition behaviors and physical activity behaviors were also not significantly correlated with youth physical activity, dietary intake, or BMI %ile. Discussion: The results for parent/guardian support to be associated with higher youth BMI %ile were unexpected and deserve attention in future research to evaluate the motivating forces behind parent/guardian support of youth physical activity and nutrition. Although parents/guardians have an influential role in the lives of adolescents, this role did not translate broadly to measurable outcomes concerning T2DM risk factors for the 10-14 year old Northern Plains American Indian youth in the study. While this study was not conclusive regarding the influence of parent/guardian factors on youth disease risk factors, this topic merits further research in light of the increasing incidence of T2DM among American Indian youth.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06112009-173623/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NONINVASIVE GENETIC SAMPLING REVELAS BLACK BEAR POPULATION DYNAMICS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN FOOD PRODUCTIVITY</field><field name="creator">McCall, Barbara</field><field name="description">I conducted research on the demography of a harvested north Idaho black bear (Ursus americanus) population to determine the underlying dynamics of changes in population abundance, to determine how much these dynamics were driven by variation in food productivity, and to evaluate how these processes could influence inferences based on mark-recapture analysis. In cooperation with Idaho Department of Fish and Game and the USDA Forest Service, I used barb-wire corrals to collect black bear DNA during 2003-2006 in the Purcell Mountains of Idaho. We analyzed these DNA samples to determine the number of uniquely identified individuals in each year, Nu. I used a combination of both genetic and mark-recapture analyses to evaluate the sources of variation in Nu over the four years and to what extent this variation was driven by changes in productivity of foods on the landscape. Specifically, I investigated deviations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and genetic substructure in relation to changes in abundance, and whether variation in vital rates were a function of changing berry productivity in the study area. I found a heterozygote deficiency and detected genetic substructure indicating I sampled &#8804; 4 subpopulations within the same area over the four years (a Wahlund Effect). My mark-recapture analyses suggest this pattern was probably in response to landscape changes in summer berry abundance. My results suggest important variation in population dynamics driven by changes in food productivity, which should be considered when using mark-recapture analyses to monitor population trends for black bears.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06112009-182902/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ASSESSMENT OF MUNICIPAL WATER RIGHTS AND WATER SYSTEMS IN THE CLARK FORK RIVER BASIN</field><field name="creator">Petersen-Perlman, Jacob Daniel</field><field name="description">In the semi-arid Inland Northwest, water is undoubtedly the most important natural resource. Western Montanas Clark Fork River basin is no exception. As the population of western Montana continues to grow, the Clark Fork River basin below the Flathead Indian Reservation is largely in de facto closure to the establishment of new water rights. Communities face a great amount of uncertainty with respect to their ability to establish new water rights to accommodate future growth due to the de facto closure, along with the ongoing adjudication process and the inability for communities to grow into their claimed water rights established before July 1, 1973. It is therefore essential for communities, and water resources planners and managers, to know their legal and physical entitlements to water. This assessment of municipal water rights and systems in the Clark Fork River basin was conducted by ascertaining the volumes and maximum flows of each communitys water right, analyzing the volume of water used annually, and projecting future water consumption amounts for the next 20 years based on projected county population growth rates. Other information gathered includes water conservation measures, water-related infrastructure, and metering. Interviews of water system managers and operators were conducted to gauge their level of understanding of water resource issues and policies that might play a significant role in each communitys ability to provide water to its residents. It appears that while the vast majority of communities in the Clark Fork River basin will have sufficient water right amounts for the next 20 years, other communities, e.g., Seeley Lake, Hamilton, and Missoula are more likely to experience difficulties in meeting future population growth with their current rights. Some communities, e.g., Butte, Columbia Falls, Superior, and Thompson Falls, may be limited in using their water rights due to water quality issues, while others, e.g., Hamilton, Missoula, and Stevensville, will be limited due to the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservations rules regarding where water rights are able to be used.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06112010-121959/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Summer wolf diet in northwestern Montana</field><field name="creator">Derbridge, Jonathan</field><field name="description">Wolf (Canis lupus) diet can be estimated from undigested remains of prey in scats or through stable isotope analysis (SIA) of wolf hair when distinct &#948;13C and &#948;15N values of potential diet sources are known. Our objectives were to compare diet analysis methods, to estimate intra-population diet variability, and to determine proportions of prey consumed by wolves. We collected scats of 4 wolf packs in northwestern Montana from June to August 2008, and guard hairs of 45 wolves from 12 packs, May to August 2009. We calculated percent biomass consumed of deer (Odocoileus spp.), elk (Cervus canadensis), moose (Alces alces), and other items from scats, and used Pearsons chi-squared tests of proportions to measure differences among packs. We used hierarchical Bayesian stable isotope mixing models to determine diet and scales of diet variation from &#948;13C and &#948;15N values of wolves and prey. We used bootstrapped scat data, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation data from stable isotopes to estimate confidence intervals of difference between results from each technique for 4 packs with matched samples. Diet results were not consistent between techniques. Deer was the most common prey item based on scats, and moose the most common based on SIA. Wolf diet was significantly different among packs based on scats, and differences among packs explained most variability in diet based on stable isotopes. We sampled 3 times as many packs for less than half the cost with SIA compared to scat analysis. Experimental data on wolf hair growth period and wolf-specific &#948;13C and &#948;15N fractionation values would provide important information for recommending the better technique.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06112010-154017/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fences</field><field name="creator">Van Paepeghem, Russell James</field><field name="description">The following is a memoir of the author&#8223;s childhood in southwestern Idaho.

The cellular machine responsible for protein synthesis, called the ribosome, is formed through the association of two unequally sized subunits, each composed of RNA and proteins. Proper assembly of each subunit is essential to ribosome function and therefore essential to the cellular life cycle. Previous studies focused on dissecting the assembly of the small ribosomal subunit (30S subunit) from E. coli have shown that 21 proteins sequentially assemble on the 16S rRNA at multiple nucleation sites. For the first time, we are able to monitor changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of the 16S rRNA upon the addition of single proteins during assembly by using time-dependent chemical probing. Results from these studies suggest that protein S17 induces multiple structural changes in 16S rRNA by first binding to helix 11 and then helix 7. S20 also induces changes in the rRNA by interacting with helix 9, 11, 44 and 13 in that order. These structural formations and rearrangements then prepare the binding sites for additional proteins (S12 and S16, respectively). This study demonstrates that time-dependent chemical probing is able to monitor the assembly of the 30S subunit at a level of detail never before seen. These studies also suggest that many motifs in the 16S rRNA structure are formed as a result of the proteins binding, lending evidence to the hypothesis that the function of ribosomal proteins is to shape and/or hold the RNA structure in place.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomolecular Structure &amp; Dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06122009-133808/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DOUBLE SAMPLING FOR COARSE WOODY DEBRIS ESTIMATIONS FOLLOWING LINE INTERSECT SAMPLING</field><field name="creator">Corrow, Allissa</field><field name="description">Coarse woody debris (CWD), an essential component of healthy forests, has typically been defined as dead and down, large woody material. Quantification of this resource provides a useful metric for assessing wildlife habitat, fuel loading, and more recently, carbon sequestration. Although many CWD sampling methods exist, accurate estimation is difficult and expensive. Double sampling incorporates auxiliary data that is positively correlated with the attribute of interest as a means of reducing sampling costs and/or increasing estimation precision. The present study investigated double sampling applications to the common CWD sampling technique, line intersect sampling (LIS). We identified aggregate length as a potential auxiliary variable for estimating aggregate volume and abundance of CWD. However, further analysis indicated that the cost difference of the sampling phases, coupled with the correlation of the variables was not sufficient to warrant double sampling in the study area. Further investigation is needed to develop accurate and efficient CWD sampling methods with widespread applicability.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resource Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06122010-133739/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gypsum Bonnet</field><field name="creator">Vespia, Maren</field><field name="description">NA</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06132010-165408/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flightless</field><field name="creator">Newlon, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">None</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06142010-144839/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"The Coming Man From Canton": Chinese Experience in Montana (1862-1943)</field><field name="creator">Merritt, Christopher William</field><field name="description">The Chinese immigrants who came to Montana during the 19th and 20th centuries forged a new community. The goals of this dissertation were to create a historical and archaeological context for Chinese Experience in Montana, and to frame the interpretation of these results within a social organization framework that highlights the role of Overseas Chinese voluntary organizations such as secret societies. Archaeologists and historians have studied the Chinese in Montana for a little over two decades, though nothing comprehensive has ever been attempted to sew together the various investigations. In addition, there has been no attempt to inventory all the known Chinese archaeological sites in Montana, and how these fit into the broad patterns of history. Between first large-scale gold discovery in Montana Territory during 1862 until 1900, the Chinese engaged largely in placer-mining endeavors and represented the largest ethnic group during this period. Federal Exclusion laws, statewide boycotts, and pervasive racism deeply affected the Chinese experience in Montana, and led to the states abandonment by the bulk of this immigrant population in the early 20th century. In overseas communities, the Chinese immigrants relied on voluntary associations to replace the traditional modes of social organization found in China. These organizations provided mutual protection to their members, and helped to organize resistance to the legal and social racism encountered in the United States and other diaspora communities. This dissertation interprets the history and archaeology of the Chinese in Montana in a framework that highlights the role of voluntary social organizations in the success of this population.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06142010-161744/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DO CASH TRANSFERS IMPACT MIGRATION?

Using the 2002 Mexican Family Life Survey, a logit model is used to estimate the effect of these cash transfer programs on household migration decisions. The empirical results suggest that Procampo income is associated with higher migration, while there is no relationship between Progresa and migration decisions of household. After accounting for community fixed effects, the coefficient capturing the relationship between Procampo and migration loses significance. These results suggest that Procampo and/or Progresa cash transfers do not affect the short-term migration rate of Mexican households which is consistent with findings in the literature.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06142010-181324/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rock Glacier Distribution, Activity and Movement, Northern Absaroka and Beartooth Ranges, MT, USA</field><field name="creator">Seligman, Zachary M</field><field name="description">Rock glaciers of the northern Absaroka and Beartooth Ranges have not previously been described. Six-hundred and sixty rock glaciers were hand digitized in a GIS and evaluated using 11 distributional characteristics. Beartooth rock glaciers were found to occur at higher elevations, receive more precipitation, and were subjected to colder temperatures. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was used to examine the predictive strength of the 11 descriptive parameters on rock-glacier activity. Elevation and average annual maximum temperatures were most strongly correlated with activity. Results were used to make inferences about permafrost distribution which coincided with estimates from previous studies. Finally, movement rates of four rock glaciers within the Black Canyon Basin of the Beartooth Mountains were estimated using photogrammetric techniques over a 51-year period. While movement rates were consistent with those determined in other Rocky Mountain locations, much of the results were inconclusive. Increased movement of the East Grasshopper rock glacier may be the result of increased glacier subsidence, while uphill movement of the Beartooth rock glacier may be indicative of rock-glacier subsidence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06152009-104116/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glacier Monitoring in Ladakh and Zanskar, northwestern India</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Martin Edward</field><field name="description">Glaciers in the Himalaya are often heavily covered with supraglacial debris, making them difficult to study with remotely-sensed imagery alone. Various methods such as band ratios can be used effectively to map clean-ice glaciers; however, a thicker layer of debris often makes it impossible to distinguish between supraglacial debris and the surrounding terrain. Previously, a morphometric approach employing an ASTER-derived digital elevation model (DEM) has been used to map glaciers in the Khumbu Himal and the Tien Shan. This project aims first to test the ability of the morphometric procedure to map small glaciers; second, to use the morphometric approach to map glaciers in Ladakh; and third, to use Landsat and ASTER data and GPS and field measurements to monitor glacier change in Ladakh over the past four decades. Field work was carried out in the summers of 2007 and 2008. For clean ice, a ratio of shortwave infrared (SWIR, 1.6-1.7 &#181;m) and near infrared (NIR, 0.76-0.86 &#181;m) bands from the ASTER dataset was used to distinguish snow and ice. For debris-covered glaciers, morphometric features such as slope, derived from a DEM, were combined with thermal imagery and supervised classifiers to map glacial margins. The method is promising for large glaciers, although problems occurred in the distal and lateral parts and in the forefield of the glaciers. The morphometric approach was inadequate for mapping small glaciers, due to a paucity of unique topographic features on the glaciers which can be used to distinguish them from the surrounding terrain. A multi-temporal analysis of three glaciers in Ladakh found that two of them have recededone since at least the mid-1970s, the other since at least 2000while a third glacier, Parkachik Glacier, seemed to have retreated in the 1980s, only to advance in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, from 2004-2008 it showed only negligible change making its current status difficult to determine without further monitoring. The glacier outlines derived during this project will be added to the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database. In testing the limits of the morphometric approach, the thesis has provided a valuable contribution to the present literature and knowledge-base regarding the mapping of debris-covered glaciers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06152009-155836/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taming the Wild: On Womanhood, Nation and Nature in Ann-Marie Macdonald's Fall on Your Knees and The Way the Crow Flies</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Yvonne Michelle</field><field name="description">This project evaluates the work of Canadian author and playwright Ann-Marie Macdonald in the context of links between ecocritical, feminist and post-colonial perspectives; it seeks to understand how broader definitions for gender provide an alternative to the patriarchal binaries that limit both individual and national identities. Part of the Canadian conscious is an anxiety that questions not only the way difference impacts their culture, but also how these differences speak to a lack of a homogenized national identity. This study focuses on Macdonald&#239;&#191;&#189;s novels Fall on Your Knees (1996) and The Way the Crow Flies (2003) , in order to examine histories that have traditionally been excluded, stories outside of colonial, and later, national rhetoric. Macdonald exhumes these stories, elevating women&#239;&#191;&#189;s voices, in particular, to reveal the danger of limiting visions of personal identity. These identities, particularly national identities, implicitly reflect deeply imbedded, and often disregarded, relationships with our natural environment. Thus, national and individual identities are inseparable from ecological concerns. Fall on Your Knees uses the image and context of gardens as a means of discovery, particularly in imaging the history of colonial settlement. The Way the Crow Flies continues this work to explore the impact of modernity and the continued policies of categorization and, subsequently, subjugation. Modern visions for land development and industrialization inform perspectives about place and selfhood as landscapes experienced a form of colonization that revised definitions for natural and unnatural spaces. These definitions are similar to those for male and female, which have traditionally place the latter in a subjugate position. The inscription of femininity parallels that of the land, its traumas providing an important collusion between land and people. It is this paper&#239;&#191;&#189;s contention that Macdonald uses her stories to destabilize male/female binaries and, ultimately, suggest an alternative to restrictive identities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06152010-133021/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quiet People</field><field name="creator">Keller, Abigail Hope</field><field name="description">Quiet People is a collection of short stories that take place in the fictional town of Kettleborough, New Hampshire.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06162009-104727/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A REVIEW OF APPEALS AND LITIGATION OVER TIMBER SALES BETWEEN 1999 AND 2008 ON THE LOLO NATIONAL FOREST</field><field name="creator">Shaffer, Matthew</field><field name="description">A review of litigation and appeals over timber sales on the Lolo National Forest for the years 1999 thru 2008 revealed that of the 157 timber sales that could have been appealed or litigated, 27%, representing 55% of the timber volume in all the reviewed sales, had some form of appeal or litigation.. The categories of timber sales with the highest percentage of appeals and/or litigation in relation to their representation within the population as a whole were those that were performed to improve forest health or to meet stewardship goals. The silvicultural prescription that had the highest percentage of appeals and/or litigation in relation to their representation within the population as a whole were thin from above prescriptions while the least frequent was a clear cut. This study intends to serve as a source of information about appeals and litigation on the Lolo National Forest over timber sales by discussing reasons why environmental groups litigate and appeal timber sales. Additionally, this study hopes to give individuals, the Forest Service, private interest groups, or citizen groups involved with attempting to decrease the number of timber sales appealed or litigated as well as the volume of wood appealed or litigated, a point of comparison to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06162009-162100/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sudden Fortune</field><field name="creator">Shelton, Lehuanani Marie</field><field name="description">A collection of short stories and experimental forms centered upon the life of Atti, a heroine whose experience as a multi-ethnic, lesbian-identified artist contributes to her (and other characters') theories about identity formation in a global community--one in which Western norms and Chamoru cultural practices are juxtaposed.

After an introduction to Hardenberg's theory of the Self and Karl Marx's theory of alienation, an analysis of Hardenberg's most widely read work, Heinrich von Afterdingen, demonstrates how Hardenberg was as concerned with the material and the social relations among human beings and their labor as he was with their spiritual endeavors. The self-development of Heinrich, the main character in Afterdingen, is chronicled in this study with special attention given to his material existence as well as the material existence of the people he encounters. This study demonstrates that Afterdingen can be read as a handbook for the development of the Self according to the theories of Hardenberg and Marx, in which the Self cannot favor the spiritual realm, or inner existence, at the expense of its material and social relations. Rather, these two spheres are both important for full self-development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06172008-150908/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Custer's Last Drag: An Examination of Tobacco Use Among the Seventh Cavalry During the Nineteenth Century</field><field name="creator">Vihlene, Shannon Marjorie</field><field name="description">Tobacco has played an integral role in global history, and there are numerous historical records related to tobacco use over the past five hundred years.

This thesis aims to give communities a way of assessing their accessible transportation services to determine if they are adequately providing transportation to these populations. In this project data was gathered through interviews with agencies that provide accessible transportation in Missoula, MT and the surrounding area. This data in conjunction with U.S. Census data was compiled and spatially analyzed using GIS to create maps to assess current accessible transportation and show where additional accessible transportation may be of value. The maps created illustrate the number of options available for locations across the study area and when accessible transportation is available. The maps show that there is variance in the number of options across the study area and that as one moves toward the outskirts of the Missoula area, accessible transportation options are very limited. Additional maps spatially display factors associated with transportation such as cost, purpose for which the transportation can be used, eligibility criteria for the services, and type of additional assistance provided to the rider. These maps indicate there is variance in these factors across the study area also. This indicates that potential users may not have access to the most suitable transportation option depending on where they need to be picked up and dropped off. A second interview was conducted to ascertain the accuracy of the maps and if the agency representatives believe this information can be used to coordinate and collaborate services with each other and help them determine how to expand or restructure services. Four out of five of the agency representatives that participated in the study believe the maps provided useful information to their agency and all agencies agreed that this process would be useful to other communities in assessing their accessible transportation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06172009-140736/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inversion</field><field name="creator">Spidahl, Anne Marie</field><field name="description">The novel Inversion is a study in human molting and the collapse of diachronic time within advanced, global, informatized capitalism.

Relatively little is known about the impact that sibling relationships have on post-divorce adjustment. The current study was designed to explore the relationship between sibling social support (emotional, instrumental, and informational support) and adjustment. Data was collected from 34 participants using the Retrospective Interview Technique (RIT). Participants identified key turning points in their adjustment process and used those points as an interview guide to talk about support from and communication with their siblings. Numerical questionnaire data was also collected at three turning points. Findings revealed 12 categories of turning points, of which Move, Change in family composition, Change in contact with non-residential parent, Intrapsychic change, and Change in parent relationship status were the most frequently reported. Five trajectories of adjustment were also found, namely Steady, Interrupted, Stagnating, Turbulent, and Declining. From the interview data, examples of social support and communication topics were assessed. Social support was evident in the forms of emotional, instrumental, informational, and perceived support as were more implicit categories like time together and common cause. Conversation topics included parent relationships, the effect of the divorce on other family members, making sense of the divorce, and opinions. From the support and communication data, 7 sibling types were proposed. Siblings who gave equal support to each other fell into the categories of Separates, Pals, Allies, and Opponents. Relationships where one sibling offered more support than the other were categorized as Parent, Protector, and Encourager. Statistically, no relationship was found between sibling support and adjustment, although relationships between parent support and adjustment were found. Explanations and implications are proposed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06182009-095000/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Five Stories</field><field name="creator">Farnworth, Bradin M</field><field name="description">A collection of short stories.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06182009-151441/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"This Blessed Plot": Negotiating Britishness in Sam Selvon's The Lonely Londoners, Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia, and Zadie Smith's White Teeth</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Kathleen</field><field name="description">This thesis considers how contemporary British literature helps us negotiate better ways of being in an increasingly diverse world. Britain understood itself as a relatively homogenous white society and reacted badly when commonwealth citizens unexpectedly began to return following World War II. Colonial migrants increasingly large presence, particularly as many settled and had children, challenged the myth of a pure Anglo-Saxon Britain and forced a re-conceiving of what it is to be British. This thesis particularly examines how colonial immigrants found ways to (re)negotiate their identities as British in the face of hostility in their mother country. Chapter One looks at how Sam Selvons The Lonely Londoners depicts ways early West Indian immigrants found to endure in immediate post-war, nationalist, Britain. I argue that while working class migrants found ways to survive, they did so at the expense of personal growth. Nevertheless, their tenacity laid down the foundations of a new Britishness on which future generations could build. Chapter Two examines Hanif Kureishis The Buddha of Suburbia. I argue that Kureishis novel indicates how second-generation migrants, who are often more psychically flexible, form their identities differently to their immigrant parents. They negotiate ways of being British via their heritage and immediate family, but also with peers, and across various boundaries including those of class, gender, and culture. Chapter Three considers Zadie Smiths White Teeth. I argue that this novel suggests how immigrants negotiate their identities across even more boundaries and increasingly take advantage of the changing circumstances of life in Britain. This literature indicates reasons for some minority groups disaffection and subsequent behavior and so helps us to better understand and negotiate difference. In the Afterword, I reiterate that, starting from Britains nationalistic fear of hybridity in the 1950s, the novels in this study show the trajectory of how colonial immigrants found ways of being accepted as British. While it must remain vigilant to possible peril, Britains social imaginary has expanded to understand the benefits of multiculturalism and of valuing all citizens as equal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06182009-160955/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Montanas HIV Prevention Groups for Men Who Have Sex With Men</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Patricia Anne</field><field name="description">This study evaluated the effectiveness of HIV prevention groups for men-who-have-sex-with-men conducted in 4 Montana communities: Butte, Bozeman, Helena and Missoula. A convenience sample of participants (n=37) were recruited from MSM who voluntarily signed-up for participation in the evaluated groups. Comparison group participants (n=31) consisted of a convenience sample of MSM recruited by Montana Targeted Prevention (MTaP) workers during the course of their regular HIV/Hepatitis C outreach activities. Behavioral changes in unprotected anal intercourse and substance use and seven HIV-transmission-behavior influencing factors (sexual communication skills, attitudes towards condoms, HIV transmission knowledge, internalized homophobia, social isolation, self-esteem and depression) were assessed at baseline and again following 9 hours of intervention exposure. No significant changes in frequency of unprotected anal intercourse were observed, however participants reported that they more regularly wear a condom as a result of the intervention. Changes in frequency of unprotected anal intercourse may have been underestimated by the short 9-week evaluation period. Forty-eight percent (n=10) of participants engaging in binge drinking (5 or more drinks in one sitting) and 22% (n=4) of marijuana using participants reported a reduction in use. Intervention group participants indicated significant positive changes in measures of depression (p=.00) and self-esteem (p=.00). Participants identified factors related to community involvement and social support as being the primary factors facilitating MSM participation in HIV prevention groups. Group participation generated multiple positive intrapersonal and interpersonal outcomes that may facilitate short-term and long-term adoption and maintenance of positive health behavior changes. In the rural and geographically vast frontier state of Montana, HIV prevention groups may also play a critical role in the health and well being of Montanas MSM community by providing gay community infrastructure and positive social norms of sexual health that may serve to reduce the damaging effects of social stigma often experienced by rural MSM.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06182009-233452/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cinnabar: Archaeology and History of Yellowstone's Lost Train Town</field><field name="creator">Dick, David Scott</field><field name="description">The archaeological work completed by the Montana Yellowstone Archaeological Project (MYAP)at Cinnabar, Montana in part as a requirement for Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

The majority of what is available does not address the Palestinians specifically, hence my study fills a void in that it empirically addresses the Palestinian people and the role of their dialect and how it ties to Palestinian Diaspora, heritage and identity. Most of the literature has not viewed Diaspora, heritage, and identity thru the lens of language or language as a major player, an important one or perhaps vital. To produce these findings will contribute to the knowledge base on the issue to the Palestinians specifically and to the concept itself and its variable elements/components that integrate and act to define it. (Hubbuch, 2004, pp. 138-139). This Thesis will argue, from the historical and cultural record of Palestine, that among the multiple aspects of Palestinian culture, language is the most crucial bearer of identity and group cohesion. In addition to this central claim about the importance of language, the thesis will draw specific conclusions about the role and use of the Levantine dialect of Arabic by analyzing the data gathered in a semi-structured online interview in which thirty nine respondents offered their shared experiences and ideas regarding their Levantine dialect of Arabic. Palestinian relationship to language is deeply associated with place, family, history, heritage, and pride in self and in community. These associations are ones that speakers of the Levantine dialect of Palestine are remarkably self-aware about; that is, the diasporic condition makes language more visible as a pivot of culture and more precious because it is under threat.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06222009-140427/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Elusive "Poem of the World": The Task of the Reader and the Problem of Knowledge in Heinrich von Kleist's Novellas "Die Marquise von O..." and "Das Erdbeben in Chili"</field><field name="creator">Brandt, Lindsey</field><field name="description">The literary works of Heinrich von Kleist (17771811) have long been an important influence on thinkers and writers interested and engaged in the German cultural tradition, particularly due to the enigmatic and highly problematic nature of his narrative approach. In recent years, however, there has been a notable surge of interest in Kleists works, which has led to the production of several articles, papers, and even entire conference panels dedicated to the investigation of his oeuvre from various angles. Why does Kleist still fascinate his readers so much, and what is it about his texts that allow for such a large and varied body of interpretation? In this thesis, I will argue that it is crucial to examine closely the interface of text and reader when analyzing Kleists novellas, specifically "Die Marquise von O" and "Das Erdbeben in Chili." I will then attempt to establish a link between Kleists unique reaction to the philosophical debates concerning epistemology and aesthetics that were taking place during his short lifetime and the experience of the reader when confronting Kleists texts. I will examine these questions first with the aid of narratology and reader-response theory, particularly by examining the issues of closure and focalization in the two narratives. Furthermore, I will illustrate how a narratological/reader-response approach to Kleists work can also inform a feminist critical approach and, likewise, how a feminist analysis can complement the former. In the final chapter, I will conduct a feminist analysis, focusing on both form and content in the two novellas to show how Kleists work both structurally and thematically challenges male Enlightenment values such as order and logic. These analyses ultimately illustrate how Kleist displaced the philosophical questions with which he was grappling into the realm of the text-reader interface, thus emulating and illuminating with this relationship the selfs quest for knowledge and meaning in the world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06222009-143532/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Collaborative Zoning in the Rural Rocky Mountains: A Process Analysis of Two Counties</field><field name="creator">Kern, Kassidy Renee</field><field name="description">This study seeks to evaluate the merits of collaborative zoning in rural areas by juxtaposing a case where zoning efforts failed to one where zoning was successfully passed by the community.

The paper addresses the importance of the personal element in international diplomacy and situates it in the context of a particular time framework that marked the end of the Cold War and which resulted in significant geopolitical changes across the globe. While recognizing the importance of larger events, such as the attempts to restructure the Soviet economy and society, this thesis argues for the significance of the personal relationship between James A. Baker, III and Eduard A. Shevardnadze in establishing a cooperative response to Iraqs invasion of Kuwait and, ultimately, to laying the groundwork for the Madrid Peace Conference. The research was conducted based on government sources, personal accounts, interviews, including personal interviews with former USSR Minister of Foreign Affairs and ex-President of Georgia, Eduard A.

I build up this claim by proposing that (i) Reichenbachs relation of association can be expressed in terms of Binding Theory in the syntax, (ii) Tense is subject to different binding principles depending on its syntactic realization so that T in main clauses must be free (i.e., subject to Principle B) but in embedded clauses T must be bound (i.e., subject to Principle A), (iii) the Spanish present subjunctive is a tenseless form which behaves syntactically very similar to an infinitive and (iv) (non)-finiteness can be defined in terms of binding. This thesis aims to contribute to linguistic theory by presenting a solution to the problem of the Spanish subjunctive and the violation of the rule of concordantia temporum, by establishing another parallel across domains, namely between the nominal and the temporal domain, which are argued in this thesis to be subject to the same syntactic principles of Binding Theory, and by providing empirical evidence that natural language makes use of syntactic relations to arrive at semantic interpretations. Finally, the findings and proposals in this thesis predict that cross-linguistically languages should prefer to use syntactic configurations over morphological systems for semantic interpretation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06232010-105659/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DESART</field><field name="creator">Schumaier, Lisa</field><field name="description">A long poem in sections.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-06242009-110708/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taming the Wild: On Womanhood, Nation, and Nature in Ann-Marie Macdonald's Fall on Your Knees and The Way the Crow Flies</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Yvonne Michelle</field><field name="description">This project evaluates the work of Canadian author and playwright Ann-Marie Macdonald in the context of links between ecocritical, feminist and post-colonial perspectives; it seeks to understand how broader definitions for gender provide an alternative to the patriarchal binaries that limit both individual and national identities. Part of the Canadian conscious is an anxiety that questions not only the way difference impacts their culture, but also how these differences speak to a lack of a homogenized national identity. This study focuses on Macdonalds novels Fall on Your Knees (1996) and The Way the Crow Flies (2003) , in order to examine histories that have traditionally been excluded, stories outside of colonial, and later, national rhetoric. Macdonald exhumes these stories, elevating womens voices, in particular, to reveal the danger of limiting visions of personal identity. These identities, particularly national identities, implicitly reflect deeply imbedded, and often disregarded, relationships with our natural environment. Thus, national and individual identities are inseparable from ecological concerns. Fall on Your Knees uses the image and context of gardens as a means of discovery, particularly in imaging the history of colonial settlement. The Way the Crow Flies continues this work to explore the impact of modernity and the continued policies of categorization and, subsequently, subjugation. Modern visions for land development and industrialization inform perspectives about place and selfhood as landscapes experienced a form of colonization that revised definitions for natural and unnatural spaces. These definitions are similar to those for male and female, which have traditionally place the latter in a subjugate position. The inscription of femininity parallels that of the land, its traumas providing an important collusion between land and people. It is this papers contention that Macdonald uses her stories to destabilize male/female binaries and, ultimately, suggest an alternative to restrictive identities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-07022010-072448/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Experience of Rural Battered Women: Overcoming Challenges</field><field name="creator">Legerski, Joanna</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of physical isolation in rural battered women. The relationships between physical isolation, level of traumatic symptoms and social support are assessed. By definition rural women are usually geographically isolated, which may contribute to the difficulty of leaving abusive relationships. Strong rural, socio-cultural norms such as traditional gender and marital roles, combined with a lack of access to beneficial services may prevent rural victims from fleeing to safety. As a result victims may be even more vulnerable to their batterers. To more fully understand difficulties faced by battered women, archival data containing a community sample of 394 women, who had experienced violence in a current or past romantic relationship, were examined. Overall quantitative findings from this sample suggest that for battered women higher violence frequency and severity are associated with greater physical isolation. In addition, high trauma symptoms are associated with greater help-seeking. Findings obtained from qualitative and quantitative data discuss isolation, culture, frequency and severity of violence, social support, and trauma symptomatology in a battered female population. Findings may provide a deeper understanding that is sensitive to the needs of women living in rural settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-07032007-090636/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital Photography</field><field name="creator">Whipple, Julie F.</field><field name="description">My professional paper is designed as a teaching tool to help other instructors to be able to teach the basics of digital photography to their students.

The thesis focuses on how Nawal Al Saadawi, through her novel Woman at Point Zero, believes, as the Western world, feminists and readers do, that Islam has degraded the social status of women. She enforces the image of Muslim women as an oppressed, silent, victim of her religion. In doing so, she collaborates with the West and its image of the inferior status of Muslim/Arab women and the violence of patriarchal Muslim societies, strengthens the colonial, orientalist discourse and thus ends up being perceived in the Muslim and Arab societies as an agent of Westernization.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-07072008-002618/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">REGULARIZATION PARAMETER SELECTION METHODS FOR ILL POSED POISSON IMAGING PROBLEMS</field><field name="creator">Goldes, John</field><field name="description">A common problem in imaging science is to estimate some underlying true image given noisy measurements of image intensity.

To successfully escape an extinction vortex and enable species recovery, all processes that affect endangered populations should be comprehensively assessed and incorporated into conservation plans. For my dissertation, I worked in conjunction with California Department of Fish and Game to develop a comprehensive research program to guide recovery efforts for federally endangered Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, the rarest subspecies of mountain sheep in North America. I initiated a combination of demographic, habitat and genetic analyses to identify the stochastic and deterministic factors limiting the recovery of this subspecies, examine the relative and synergistic impacts of these factors on the performance of Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, and the benefits of different management activities for stimulating recovery efforts. Just as the extinction vortex predicts, I found that small populations of Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep were driven by a number of stochastic and deterministic processes. Demographic, habitat, climate, predation, and genetic factors operated singly and in concert to shape the overall viability of this subspecies. The interaction of factors led to atypical demographic patterns that deviated from theoretical expectations and increased extinction risk. To alleviate extinction processes, I found that management strategies must be tailored to population-specific dynamics, targeting those vital rates and ecological drivers which have the greatest power to increase performance. Results from this study have elucidated critical aspects of Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep ecology, provided a recovery strategy for this subspecies, and supplied new quantitative tools for examining the dynamics of small and endangered populations. Ultimately, this work offers an example of assessing population viability, not in terms of probability of extinction, but in terms of quantifying conservation measures that will alleviate extinction dynamics and achieve endangered species recovery goals.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-07082010-103812/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Zinc and Reactive Oxygen Species in the Regulation of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase</field><field name="creator">Wilham, Jason Michael</field><field name="description">Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a very serious disease affecting nearly 5 in 1000 newborns each year. The development of PPHN has been linked to a decrease in the activity and expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which eNOS is regulated to identify new pathways and novel therapies for PPHN. eNOS is dynamically regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and developmental levels, however mechanisms of this regulation are unresolved. Our data indicates that increases in eNOS expression and activity correlate with increased cellular levels of labile zinc (Zn). In addition, our analysis of the eNOS promoter indicated the presence of a putative heavy metal response element (HRE) in the 5'-flanking sequence. We hypothesized that nitric oxide (NO) may be regulating eNOS expression and activity indirectly through its ability to regulate cellular levels of free Zn. Further, we hypothesized that Zn exerts an effect on eNOS at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Our results suggested that both NO and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activate eNOS in a Zn-dependent manner by liberating cellular stores of Zn and activating the heavy metal-responsive transcription factor 1, MTF-1, which then would bind to the eNOS 5'-regulatory MRE. We found that basal zinc levels in endothelial cells (ECs) helped maintain eNOS promoter activity and total protein levels, but did not affect eNOS dimer levels. However, supplementing ECs with exogenous Zn increased eNOS total and dimer protein levels and activity, mostly through MTF-1. At higher, non-toxic doses of Zn, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was much higher. eNOS was inhibited by high ROS levels through enzyme fragmentation. Lastly, an eNOS enzyme cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), was found to help maintain eNOS protein due to its high antioxidant potential. In conclusion, eNOS appears to be regulated by NO and ROS through an increase in intracellular Zn, thus activating MTF-1, which binds to the 5' flanking region of the eNOS promoter.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

Singing fulfilled the three requirements of choice in a project: risk, rigor, and the requirement of having to do it. I had sung as a young man, and stopped as the result of listening to an adult tell me that I could not sing. During the following 23 years, I used percussion and became a dancer in order to express myself. The art forms of percussion and dance I was drawn to like a man is drawn to a woman that he must have. What about being drawn to an art form in order to continue existing? An artistic pursuit whose means of expression are a salvation? One can read about many artists who came into an art form out of necessity. Their life outside of expressing themselves was bleak and the art form became their cry. I by no means wish to place myself at the level of expertise of such artists that came to their art to survive, or to imply that I paid my dues to the extent that certain artists have (artists such as Hank Williams, or the Blues artist Robert Johnson, for example). I do mean to express through this paper my experience of the catharsis in singing country music and the Blues. My beginning singing came at a time when I really needed it; the music helped me through a difficult time. The title of the paper is Fall and Redemption: the Essence of Country Music for this reason. It is in Narrative form, foot printing my process and discovery of the music. I attempted to combine lifes experiences with the discovery of the music. The experiences were the inspiration behind playing the music. The essence of country music and the Blues is its sincerity, and I hope that I have combined my lifes narrative with the artistic process effectively, as the time period (December 2005 to June 2007) was a time in which art was defined by life, and life was defined by art.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-07172007-180612/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Out of the Art Closet and Into the Middle School"</field><field name="creator">Schowengerdt, Angela Nichole</field><field name="description">In this project my primary goal was to expose the public to the artistic self that I was so sure of in high school, but had lost in the years following. I was so sure of myself and art while in the confines of middle school and high school. Once I got into college I found myself lacking that confidence, due to the fact that I was surrounded by many great artists and I felt as though I was not so great anymore. I lost sense of who I am as an artist, and put that talent on a back burner in my life. Since I began the creative pulse, I began regaining a sense of who I am, and realized that I had lost something I truly love. In my field project the first year in the creative pulse, I worked at creating a mural for my unborn child. After realizing that I could do that, I gained some lost confidence and decided to do the stage design, lighting, and artwork for a school play and as my final creative project. I would be working with a colleague and friend in this endeavor, which made it seem a little more doable. After tackling the personal task of doing art again, I felt that the next step in reclaiming myself as an artist was to go big. By going big I mean involving everything I am surrounded by on a daily basis: colleagues, students, family, public, radio, news, and newspaper. I felt that by doing this, my artistic self would have no choice but to be shown; it could no longer hide.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-07192007-130411/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic anthropology : its contribution to forensic cases submitted to the University of Montana for analysis</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Ana M.</field><field name="description">The Anthropology Lab at the University of Montana is regularly consulted by law enforcement agencies throughout the state of Montana on cases suspected to involve skeletal human remains.

The Green Room, Center Stage and Summer Musicale started as little more than groups of friends who loved theater putting up a show. All three experienced success for several years. However, all three eventually crumbled. Before I built my own troupe, I needed to spend some time planning and learning how to avoid what my predecessors failed to do. I examined my involvement and experiences with these three companies. My reflection, discussions with other theater members, and investigation revealed that lack of experience, inadequate financial understanding and low standards of quality contributed to each of their demises. Following reflection on these companies, I gained insight into what makes a successful theater by interviewing community members who are familiar with theater organizations and the community of Great Falls. With their input and my own reflections I then researched what the experts had to say on the subject. These experts either started their own now prospering companies or they consult with theater companies on how to make an organization better. Equipped with the knowledge from all of these resources, I formulated my own plan to produce quality theater in Great Falls I established the beginnings of a theater organization to produce creative work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative Pulse</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08042009-145939/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biosignature storage in sulfate minerals- synthetic and natural investigations of the jarosite group minerals</field><field name="creator">Kotler, Julia Michelle</field><field name="description">The discovery of jarosite on Mars in 2004 generated increased interest in the properties of the mineral related to the search for life on other planets. Several studies indicate that the formation of jarosite can be linked to biological activity on Earth and biomolecules such as amino acids have been found associated with terrestrial jarosite samples. A series of natural and synthetic investigations using different jarosite end-members has been conducted and is presented in this dissertation to investigate the possibility that jarosite can store biosignatures. Natural samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction, elemental carbon analysis and laser-desorption Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LD-FTMS) and were found to contain the amino acid glycine. Synthetic experiments were conducted in which the different end-members were synthesized in the presence of glycine as well as the amino acid alanine and the amino acid breakdown product methylamine. These samples were analyzed by x-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, LD-FTMS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Results of these experiments show that the detection of the biosignature and the effect that biomolecule has on the jarosite minerals is dependent on the end-member and indicate that the jarosite minerals are an excellent target for detecting potential signs of past life on other planets.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08062009-143516/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">It is a strange thing for us to see water being sold: Local Perceptions of the Fijian Bottled Water Industry</field><field name="creator">Ulrich, Jessica Dawn</field><field name="description">Despite the availability of affordable, clean water from taps in our homes, increasing numbers of people are willing to pay for the convenience of portable water, and to consume bottled water imported from an exotic location, such as Fiji. Consequently, FIJI Water, an American-owned multinational corporation, now constitutes approximately 29 percent of Fijis domestic exports. An important question that no one has asked to date is how do stakeholders in Fiji make sense of the rapidly growing bottled water industry? Examining how water is changing from a natural entitlement to a commodity throughout the world, and exploring how this is affecting stakeholders in Fiji in particular, will help in understanding what sort of impacts commodification of a natural resource on a worldwide scale has on a community level. Using data collected through interviews and observations in Fiji, this qualitative research project examines discourses that residents of Fijian communities in close proximity to the bottled water plant and representatives of the FIJI Water Company use to make sense of the global bottled water market and how these perceptions relate to larger questions about globalization, consumerism, inequality, and justice. But what happens if the demand for bottled water dries up? This thesis examines the dependency that Fiji is developing with the bottled water industry and analyzes the situation using an environmental justice framework. I argue that although the bottled water industry may be beneficial in the short-term for some Fijian stakeholders because of the jobs it provides and the donations the company makes to local communities, the environmental, economic, social, and cultural impacts of the industry may be detrimental to Fiji in the future.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08172009-192117/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender, Body, and Wilderness: searching for refuge, connection, and ecological belonging</field><field name="creator">Meyer, Angela Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to explore, describe, and explain how people (gbtlq identified persons in particular) experience gender and body in wilderness settings. The motivations for this research include: the current context of gender and gender oppression in American society; the potential of wilderness experiences to offer different ways of being and escape from social constrictions; and gaps in the literature on gender and wilderness. A qualitative/interpretive approach was employed for this research which encompasses aspects of phenomenology, feminist methodology, and grounded theory. The results and analysis for this study yielded an analytical story about ecological belonging which includes locating the self, awakening of the body, feelings of connectedness, wilderness as refuge from normative gender, vulnerability, and the wilderness setting. In this story, we find that participants can experience wilderness as a refuge from normative gender because wilderness is unpatrollable and because wild places can offer refuge from un-accepting people and judgment; and because wilderness is a sort of holding environment for freedom of expression and safety in change and transition. This study also shows how participants are able to experience a profound sense of connection and ecological belonging because they experience themselves as human animals; an experience which awakens ones sense of vulnerability. Connecting with our bodies, with our animal-selves, and feeling vulnerable as a human animal changes the potential for ecological belonging; it allows us feel our mortality and acknowledge that we are not at the top of the food chain. This research concludes by offering substantive and theoretical conclusions including recommendations for wilderness educators and managers; future research directions for gender and wilderness; and how wilderness experiences can inform ethical models for living in contemporary society. For instance, while the lessons wilderness offers may be infinitefrom this study we can at least discern that part of repairing the human relationship with nature means repairing our relationship with all oppressed Others whereby domination is justified through faulty presumptions of moral superiority. Imperative to this is experiencing ourselves as animals in an ecological system and recognizing the damage caused by the social structures that placate our wildness.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Society and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08192010-162532/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fierce Flames and the Golden Lotus: Case Studies on the Madness and Creativity Connection</field><field name="creator">Swindall, Reuben Jay</field><field name="description">A historical/biographical analysis of the connection between creativity and a variety of psychoses including: syphilis, epilepsy, schizophenia and manic-depression/bi-polar disorder.

Believed to increase blood flow, decrease swelling, reduce muscle tension, and increase a sense of well-being, massage is a widely used manual therapy across the world. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a twenty-minute sports massage on mood state, range of motion, sports performance, and perceived performance. Methods: This repeated measures study consisted of passive recovery and massage recovery trials. Baseline testing included the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, range of motion measurements of hip flexion and extension, knee flexion and extension, and ankle plantarflexion and dorsiflexion, as well as sports performance testing of vertical jump, and perceived performance rating on a scale from 1 to 10. A five minute, 100 watt, bike warm-up was completed before a 130-foot contact plyometric workout before the randomly assigned intervention. Subjects then returned at 24 and 48 hours post intervention for repeat testing of mood state, range of motion, sport performance, and perceived performance. Analysis: Descriptive statistics were calculated using Excel. All data was analyzed in SPSS using repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustments when necessary. Results: No significant results were found for mood state, sport performance, or range of motion (p &gt; .05). Perceived performance was found to be significantly higher at the 24-hour time point in the massage group when compared to the passive recovery group (p = .007). Conclusions: Perceived performance after a massage intervention significantly differed from the passive recovery group. Mood state, range of motion, and sport performance provide no support for the use of sports massage, however, the psychological benefits of the perceived performance may be beneficial enough to warrant the use of the manual therapy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08202010-113454/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Experiences of the Certified Athletic Trainer and the Athlete Post-Surgery</field><field name="creator">Cummings, Sarah G</field><field name="description">none</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08212008-110550/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tertiary Sediments of the Big Hole Valley and Pioneer Mountains, Southwestern Montana: Age, Provenance, and Tectonic Implications</field><field name="creator">Roe, Warren Paul</field><field name="description">Tertiary terrestrial sedimentary rocks of the Big Hole basin and Pioneer Mountains of southwestern Montana provide a record of regional extensional tectonism. Detailed observations of stratigraphy and sedimentology at widely scattered outcrops indicate the presence of paleosols, fine-grained debris flows, small alluvial channels, and rare fluvial deposits. U-Pb geochronology of detrital zircons and air-fall tuffs indicates the presence of Oligocene to Middle Miocene sedimentary rocks outcropping at the surface. Though the presence of detrital muscovite in several outcrops indicates derivation from the nearby 2-mica Chief Joseph pluton, a predicted ~75 Ma zircon population is not present: instead, a persistent peak of 70-72 Ma zircons is found throughout the basin, indicating the Chief Joseph pluton may have a younger emplacement age than is currently recognized. Simple physical models developed from Bouguer anomalies indicate the basin deepens and widens toward the south, which agrees with prior work suggesting Eocene initiation of extension in the Big Hole and places it in a class of extensional basins that formed in the early Tertiary. Late Cretaceous, Eocene, and Mesoproterozoic detrital zircon populations, along with consistently immature lithic sands, all indicate sediments were derived from local bedrock sources found around the rim of the modern Big Hole Valley. While these results indicate the Tertiary Big Hole basin resembled the modern basin, some later deformation may have cut off and reversed a paleodrainage flowing out of the southeastern portion of the basin, possibly leading to the modern configuration of the Big Hole River and the deep gorge it carves across the eastern Pioneer Mountains.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08232010-181233/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Fiscal Decentralization on Health and Education Spending and Outcomes: Evidence from Ethiopia</field><field name="creator">Vander Naald, Brian Philip</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the impacts of fiscal decentralization on woreda level spending and local health and education outcomes in the Amhara region of Ethiopia.

In similar fashion, we also predict that local spending patterns will impact future outcomes. Government collected household survey data and local government expenditure data are used to investigate this theory. While results indicate that some woreda conditions have an effect on future local spending behavior, the effect of local spending on future outcomes is ambiguous.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08242007-174106/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of a structured exercise program on physical activity patterns and assessing relationships between accelerometry and strength and running performance characteristics in male, college students</field><field name="creator">Grant, Vernon Matthew</field><field name="description">The primary purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a supervised exercise training program on physical activity (PA) patterns. A secondary objective of the study was to determine if accelerometers can predict variables associated with strength and running performance. A total of 79 adult, male, college students completed a 12 week exercise training program that consisted of pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, and running three hours per week. The subjects trained three days/week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) and conducted a performance test (PT) every Wednesday. Physical activity (average daily time spent in sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous PA), performance strength and running variables (pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, and 1.5 mile run time), and body composition (BC) (weight (kg), percent body fat (PBF), fat free mass (FFM;kg), and fat mass (FM;kg)) were assessed before and after 12 weeks of the exercise training program. Results showed the 12 week exercise training program had no effect on the average daily time (min) spent in sedentary, light, moderate or vigorous activity. There were significant positive correlations between average daily time spent in vigorous PA and pull-ups (p&lt;.05), sit-ups (p&lt;.01), and push-ups (p&lt;.01). There were significant negative correlations between average daily time spent in moderate (p&lt;.05) and vigorous (p&lt;.01) PA and 1.5 mile run times. Additionally, there were significant negative correlations between BC and weight, PBF, and FM and pull-ups, sit-ups, and push-ups (p&lt;.01). Data showed a a significant positive relationship between weight, PBF, and FM and 1.5 mile run time (p&lt;.01). As expected, strength and running performance significantly improved in every area (p&lt;0 .001) with an average gain of four pull-ups, 31 sit-ups, 15 push-ups, and a mean decrease of 30 seconds on the 1.5 mile run. The structured exercise intervention significantly improved strength and running performance characteristics, which included pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups and a 1.5 mile run time. The results from this study show that the 12 week exercise training program did not affect PA levels in the participants but PA (vigorous) and BC (weight, PBF, and FM) may be able to predict pull-ups, sit-ups, push-ups, and 1.5 mile run performance variables.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health &amp; Human Performance</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08242010-134442/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glacier</field><field name="creator">Katz, Leah</field><field name="description">No Abstract</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine Arts</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08252007-105159/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMAGES AS A LAYER OF POSITIVE RHETORIC: A VALUES-BASED CASE STUDY EXPLORING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN VISUAL AND VERBAL ELEMENTS FOUND ON A RURAL NATURAL RESOURCES NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION WEBSITE</field><field name="creator">Brechtel, Vailferree Stilwell</field><field name="description">No Abstract.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08262008-152018/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You Got the Job, Now What?: An Evaluation of the New Employee Orientation Program at the University of Montana</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Shiloh M.

Evanescent fluorescence from samples in the FOCap was measured by coupling the FOCap to a light source and a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The FOCap has negligible excitation light loss over long lengths (20 m or more) for a range of wavelengths. The evanescent fluorescence was linear up to at least 20 m for a solution in the core and up to at least 15 m for a fluorophore covalently attached to the inner surface. Evanescent fluorescence measurements in 50, 150, and 250 &#181;m inner diameter FOCaps indicate that greater sensitivity is achieved with thinner-walled capillaries which have more internal reflections. FOCaps can be fined tuned for a desired sensitivity by manipulating their physical dimensions. The ability of the FOCap to function as an indirect chemical sensor for nitroaromatic compounds is demonstrated with a pyrene-labeled waveguide.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08272007-155204/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining Narratives of Place: Representations of Xinjiang in Tourism and Geography Education</field><field name="creator">Church, Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, located in northwest China, is represented in tourism and geographic education literature.

When PrP misfolds, it aggregates and causes neurological disease and death in mammals. The structure of the non-pathogenic isoform has been determined while the structures of the disease related isoforms are unknown. The nitration labeling patterns of three PrP isoforms with peroxynitrite and tetranitromethane, as detected by mass spectrometry, are reported. Two conserved tyrosine residues (tyrosines 149 and 150) are not labeled by either reagent in the normal cellular form of the prion protein but these residues become reactive after the protein has been converted to one of two aggregated isoforms. Another difference observed is that two other conserved tyrosine residues, 225 and 226, are much less reactive in both aggregated isoforms, while all other tyrosine residues show virtually no isoform specific-labeling. Thus, two regions been identified in which Tyr residues undergo a change in solvent accessibility, which may be due to a conformational change in that region or to inter-subunit packing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08282007-194643/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of fractures before and after removal of soft tissue: a case report</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Walter Loren</field><field name="description">No abstract</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08282009-083848/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Home Swede Home: The Archaeology of Swedish Cultural Identity at a Western Homestead</field><field name="creator">Haught, Amanda Clare</field><field name="description">In the summer of 2003, the University of Idaho conducted an archaeological field school at the Nora Creek site under the direction of Dr. Mark Warner at a Swedish homestead just east of Troy, Idaho. The field school unearthed a plethora of historical artifacts including metal, glass, ceramic, and faunal items left behind by the inhabitants of the Johanson homestead in Nora, Idaho. Historical documentation indicates that the Johansons immigrated to America from Sweden in 1882 and they arrived in Nora in 1891. The research goal of this thesis is to determine whether and how a signature of Swedish identity may be manifested in the material culture of the Nora Creek site. The glass and ceramic assemblages, as well as the faunal collection, are integrated with historical research to examine this topic. In order to pursue an archaeology of Swedish identity, it is essential to consider the ways in which class, gender, and cultural identity contributed to a Swedish identity in the Nora Creek assemblage versus general homesteading assemblages contemporary to the time frame of the site.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08292010-190640/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Verb Contraction in the West Saxon Dialect of Old English: An Optimality Theory Account</field><field name="creator">Mix, Melinda</field><field name="description">The phenomena of verb contraction in the West Saxon dialect of Old English has been described in many grammars of the language. However, most of these use a traditional rule-based analysis of the sound changes which occur. This thesis re-analyzes the data in terms of Optimality Theory (OT), which uses a system of constraint ranking to account for sound changes. The advantage of using OT is that it offers a single ranking to explain sound changes that would require separate rules and ordering in a more traditional analysis. Section 1 introduces the motivation for approaching this data from OT. Section 2 outlines relevant grammatical features of Old English, and the West Saxon dialect in particular. Section 3 applies OT to the data itself. The data is organized according to the final consonant of the verb stem in order to allow a process of analysis that builds a constraint ranking able to account for the changes in all the verbs under consideration, including vowel deletion, assimilation, dissimilation, and simplification of consonant clusters. Section 4 discusses the theoretical contribution of this study and suggests related areas in which the analysis could be further applied.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-08312007-211250/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Modern Examination of Marcus Goldsteins Mexican Immigrant Population Data: Comparisons of Mexican-born and U.S.-born Children and Adults Living in 1930s America and Mexico</field><field name="creator">Gango, Amanda Katelin</field><field name="description">Modern statistical methods were employed in order to test the statistical validity and conclusions of Marcus Goldsteins (1943) original data consisting of nineteen different anthropometric measurements on two different groups of individuals, Mexican immigrants and their children residing in the San Antonio, Texas area and Mexican natives living in central and northern Mexico.

I did have a strong knowledge of the subject but I decided to approach the project with a beginners mind and take a risk teaching a form of theatre I knew little about. Over the course of the school year, my students and I learned together. We researched the history, movement, and production elements of Commedia dellArte. The end result was a Commedia inspired performance where Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet collided with A Midsummer Nights Dream. While studying Commedia dellArte the students learned how to take risks, work together, write a show, produce a show, and enjoy the journey to an end result. I discovered that it is not necessary to be an expert in everything I teach.

To abate these negative consequences, physical Best Management Practices (BMPs) are implemented, sometimes with no knowledge of erosion hot spots. With the need to minimize water quality impacts while at the same time accounting for multiple considerations and constraints, road BMP planning at the watershed scale is a difficult task. To assist in this planning process, a methodology is presented here that combines WEPP: Road erosion predictions with simulated annealing optimization. Under this methodology, erosion predictions associated with BMP options for a segment comprise the objective function of an optimization problem. This methodology was tested on a watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin. WEPP: Road input data was gathered through road surveys. Modeling results predicted relatively little sediment leaving the forest buffer, as a result of numerous well-maintained BMPs and the dry climate found in the watershed. A sensitivity analysis for all WEPP: Road input parameters is presented, which provides insight into the general applicability of these erosion estimates as well as the relative importance of each input parameter. After evaluating erosion risk across the entire watershed, applicable BMPs were assigned to problem road segments and WEPP: Road was used to predict change in sediment leaving the buffer with BMP implementation at a given site. These predictions, combined with budget constraints as well as equipment scheduling considerations, were incorporated into an algorithm using simulated annealing as its optimization engine. Three modeled scenarios demonstrate the viability of this methodology in reducing total sediment leaving the road buffer over a planning horizon. Of the 173 segments surveyed, 38 segments could be treated using generic BMPs. For all three scenarios, BMP-SA reduced sediment leaving the buffer by as much as 70% over the course of a 20-year planning horizon. For the 38 segments treated with BMPs, sediment was reduced by greater than 90% over the planning horizon. This methodology is a viable approach for streamlining watershed-scale road network BMP planning, despite its heavy reliance on road erosion estimates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09012009-091937/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the Accuracy of Lidar as a Forest Inventory Tool Using Individual Stem Identification and Attribution</field><field name="creator">Floch, Luke</field><field name="description">Lidar is fast becoming one of the most widely used and accurate remote sensing tools for forest inventory. The means by which the lidar data is used to accomplish these inventories varies greatly. This study examines the use of individual tree detection and attribution to assess various forest characteristics, along with testing two alternative methods of determining canopy cover from lidar. Individual stem detection was accomplished using a local maxima algorithm. The total number of stems detected by lidar was 6% lower than field tallied stems, with regression analysis yielding an R2 of 0.59 and RMSE of 188/ha. The difference in number of lidar versus field trees also differed by density. For those plots with a density greater than 600 trees/ha, the number of stems detected by lidar was 26% lower than field measured stems. For those plots with less than 600 trees/ha, lidar detected a much larger number of small stems (&lt; 35 cm diameter), leading to a larger estimate of tree density overall (~25% more lidar trees). Field based measures of mean and maximum height were highly correlated with the lidar data, resulting in R2 values of 0.85 and 0.89, and RMSE values of 1.6 and 1.7 respectively. Overall mean diameter and basal area were closely estimated by lidar, with both field and lidar mean diameter at 27.8 cm and total basal area at 77.3 m2 for lidar and 77.4 m2 field data. Plot-level comparisons of these 2 attributes showed some variation however. Mean for the diameter had an R2 of just 0.56 and an RMSE of 4.7 cm. For the plot level basal area, R2 was 0.57 with an RMSE of 0.8 m2/0.1 ha. Canopy cover was found to be most accurately estimated using the intensity (i.e. returned energy) of the lidar pulses and calculating the ratio of canopy intensity to total intensity. The high correlation between lidar-based estimates and field-based estimates suggests that lidar data can be effectively used to help provide complete wall-to-wall data for key forest inventory attributes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09012010-112650/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UNTAPPED RESOURCES HOW UNDERDEVELOPED GENDER EMPOWERMENT CONSTRAINS THE DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL IN BANGLADESH</field><field name="creator">Cook , Taylor Michelle</field><field name="description">Gender empowerment is an oft-cited result of microfinance participation. However, research to verify this outcome continues to produce ambivalent results implying that microfinance programs are not maximizing their potential impact. While gender empowerment may be a desirable end to development, it is less often used as a means to achieve development goals. This paper tests the hypothesis that gender empowerment improves microfinance program performance using data from the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) and a theoretical framework based on prevalent institutional ideologies. The results show that empowered clients have a higher likelihood of attaining desirable program outcomes. These results can be taken as evidence that microfinance organizations should consider investments in support programs to directly address social impediments to gender empowerment as a way to increase their overall effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09042008-185041/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My Brother the Buffalo: An Ethnohistorical Documentation of the 1999 Buffalo Walk and the Cultural Significance of Yellowstone Buffalo to the Lakota Sioux and Nez Perce Peoples</field><field name="creator">Tarka, Sarah Anne</field><field name="description">This study was prepared for the National Park Service to serve as documentation of the cultural significance of Yellowstone buffalo to two American Indian cultural groups, the Nez Perce and the Lakota Sioux, and of the 1999 Buffalo Walk and accompanying ceremony that took place within the boundary of the park.

At the cellular level, the uptake of protease resistant prion protein (PrP-res), which strongly correlates with infectivity and is a valid marker for TSE infection, is one of the earliest events that must occur during TSE infection. Given the difficulty of clearly distinguishing input PrP-res from either PrP-res or protease-sensitive PrP (PrP-sen) made by the cell, the uptake of PrP-res from an infectious inoculum into the host cell remains a poorly understood process. Through the development of a novel assay to exclusively detect input PrP-res we hypothesized that the acute infection of cells by PrP-res is mediated through general processes such as endocytosis, whereas internalization, retention, and propagation of PrP-res are dictated by specific characteristics of both the host cell and PrP-res. Using PrP-res tagged with a unique epitope to the mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4, we developed a detection system to specifically follow the acute cellular uptake of PrP-res. Mouse neural and fibroblast cells were exposed to three different mouse scrapie strains and PrP-res from the inoculum monitored. For all strains, PrP-res uptake was rapid and independent of both cellular prion protein expression and cell type. However, only 30%-40% of the cells were able to internalize PrP-res and PrP-res aggregate size influenced PrP-res uptake. Furthermore, infectious brain homogenate PrP-res was taken up more efficiently then PrP-res in either microsome or partially purified preparations. Our results suggest that PrP-res aggregate size, the PrP-res microenvironment, and/or host cell-specific factors can all influence whether or not a cell takes up PrP-res following exposure to TSE infectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

Since most students are educated in public schools, parents' choice of other educational alternatives is often perceived as a deviation from the societal norm. Friends and neighbors of parents who home school rarely understand their motivation for doing so. This study addresses the following question: why do parents remove their children from traditional, public school programs to initiate home schooling, and how well do public school personnel understand this motivation? Using qualitative case study methodology, the researcher confined the study to a specific concentrated population of home schooling families. Phenomenological data analysis procedures were used to refine the volume of data and to construct a narrative containing the essence of parents' lived experience concerning the decision to home school their children. A total of 31 parents from 20 home schooling families participated in semi-structured face-to-face interviews with the researcher. Six public school administrators and 12 teachers from schools directly impacted by home schooling were also interviewed. Parents explained their motives for initiating home school programs and elaborated by telling their stories. Educators described their experiences with children being removed from their schools and with home school children returning to the classroom. They shared their experiences and perceptions of the value of home school and issues relating to student learning. Educators were included in order to determine how well they understand parents' reasons for choosing to home school a child. Data analysis revealed eight primary factors that initially motivated parents in this study to choose home schooling for their children: (1) negative effects of peer socialization; (2) religion; (3) a child's special learning needs and disabilities; (4) negative personal experiences of a parent as a student in school; (5) lack of administrative support; (6) an incident at school involving the child; (7) unique environmental needs of the family; and (8) recruitment. Data analysis also revealed that educators' understanding of these motivations was limited. Although educators' views of home schooling were primarily negative, they are clearly keenly interested in and concerned about the learning of all children, in and out of school.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Education</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09102008-155429/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DIVORCED FAMILIES AND FAMILIES UTILIZING SUPERVISED VISITATION SERVICES: CHILD BEHAVIOR, INTERPARENTAL CONFLICT, PARENTING ATTITUDES AND PARENTAL STRESS</field><field name="creator">Marchetti, Diana Eleonora Maria</field><field name="description">Research has repeatedly demonstrated the association between families of divorce and variables of child behavior, interparental conflict and parenting attitudes. However, overall research exploring supervised visitation services and examining these variables in relationship to this population is limited. Furthermore, studies designed to compare these groups (divorced and supervised visitation) is sparse. Overall, children from single parent homes (e.g., divorced and/or supervised visitation situations) tend to have more child behavior and adjustment problems as compared to children of intact families (Hetherington, Cox &amp; Cox; 1982; Portes, Howell, Brown, Eichenberger, &amp; Mas, 1992). However, such problems are not attributed to marital disruption alone but are also impacted by the interparental conflict. In addition, a plethora of literature has suggested that discipline and attitudes toward corporal punishment are associated with child behavior and adjustment problems (Kurtz, Gardin, Wodarski, &amp; Howing, 1993; Strassberg, Dodge, Pettit &amp; Bates, 1994; Tunner &amp; Finkelhor, 1996). Finally there is ample research linking parenting stress and trauma to all of these variables: child behavior, interparental conflict, and parenting practices and beliefs. Thus, the interplay of these variables and the way in which they impact both divorced and supervised visitation families was explored in the present study. Results yielded a number of significant findings. Partner psychological aggression and self negotiation scores were significantly higher in the supervised visitation sample than in the divorced sample. Scores on numerous child behavior indices (e.g., social behavior, attention, and total child behavior) for males were significantly higher than those for females. In addition gender, but not group membership (e.g., divorce or supervised visitation) had a min effect on total child behavior scores. Results demonstrated a significant relationship between partner injury scores (e.g., interparental violence) and child anxiety/depression scores. Implications of results are explored in terms of needed community services, therapeutic groups, and outreach to underserved populations (e.g., ethnic groups, victims of domestic violence, younger parents). In review of the qualitative data, it was very apparent that the expectations of parents at the supervised visitation center paralleled the goals of the centers as a whole (e.g., protection for the child).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09102008-164042/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Efficacy in the Implementation of New Curriculum Supported by Professional Development</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Douglas Shields</field><field name="description">A large body of literature regarding professional development and its effects on teaching and student achievement and learning has emerged over the last decade. There are many teachers who either have limited access to professional development activities or who have access and choose not to take part in professional development activities. This qualitative study employed a phenomenological tradition in describing the "lived experiences" of participants involved in the implementation of new curriculum. Fourteen teachers and seven principals were purposefully selected to be part of this study in a rural school jurisdiction in southern Alberta. Through a qualitative analysis, this study shared teachers' perceptions as they described the role professional development plays in enhancing teacher efficacy and changing teaching practices in the implementation of new curriculum. Data were collected during face-to-face, semi-structured interviews, and the analysis of data revealed six topics: the need for change, professional development and curriculum implementation, professional development and teaching practices, professional development and teacher efficacy, professional development and student learning and motivation. Major findings from this study concluded that teacher participants recognize PD as the common thread that motivates teachers, improves their sense of efficacy, assists them in successful curriculum implementation, heightens their awareness of the need to improve teaching practices and the need to become student-centered and improve student learning. Principal participants concurred with teacher participants, and recognize the role leaders play in motivating teachers to become actively engaged in professional learning activities. Professional development plays a key role in providing teachers with knowledge and skills to hone their teaching practices, to rejuvenate them, and to improve student learning. It also assists teachers in successfully implementing new curricula. As teachers become aware of the need to change teaching practices in order to improve teacher efficacy, professional development provides opportunities to gain confidence and heighten their sense of personal efficacy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Educational Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09142007-115147/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NAD(P)H:QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE (NQO1)-DIRECTED LAVENDAMYCIN ANTITUMOR AGENTS: STRUCTURE-BASED DESIGN, MOLECULAR MODELING AND STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY STUDIES.</field><field name="creator">Hassani, Mary</field><field name="description">NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a two-electron reductase that catalyzes an NAD(P)H-dependent activation of many quinone-based antitumor agents. NQO1, expressed at high levels in many human solid tumors, can be used as a target for enzyme-directed bioreductive antitumor drug development. We hypothesized that lavendamycins, quinolinedione antitumor antibiotics, can be activated by NQO1 in cancer cells that overexpress NQO1 to exhibit selective toxicity toward those cells. The effects of functional group changes on the metabolism of lavendamycins by recombinant human NQO1 were studied using a spectrophotometric assay. These structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies determined key structural features that were required for lavendamycin substrate specificity. Cytotoxicity toward human colon adenocarcinoma NQO1-deficient (BE) and NQO1-rich (BE-NQ) cells was also determined using colorimetric and clonogenic assays. The best lavendamycin substrates for NQO1 were also the most selectively toxic to the BE-NQ cells compared to BE cells. To facilitate structure-based design of more optimal lavendamycin substrates and NQO1-directed lavendamycin antitumor agent development, we developed a 1H69 crystal structure-based in silico model of the NQO1 active site and performed lavendamycin-docking studies. The docking was performed using the FlexX module of SYBYL software. Lavendamycin analogues were designed as NQO1 substrates utilizing our SAR and docking data as structure-based design criteria. Docking and biological studies on the analogues were performed and were consistent suggesting the in silico model of the enzyme possessed practical predictive power. Our results also suggested practicality of the design criteria resulting in the discovery of good NQO1 substrates with selective toxicity toward BE-NQ cells. The mechanisms of NQO1-mediated selective cytotoxicity of good lavendamycin substrates in BE and BE-NQ cells were also investigated including induction of oxidative stress and apoptosis. Biomarkers of oxidative stress including formation of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-2dG), an indicator of oxidative DNA damage, and depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) were examined using an HPLC-based method and a colorimetric assay, respectively. Induction of apoptosis was examined using a colorimetric assay. Our results revealed that oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis induction by a good lavendamycin substrate was NQO1 dependent and that the poor substrate for NQO1 caused neither oxidative stress nor apoptosis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

Yet many outside of the state equate Iowa with staid provincialism because of its rural isolation in the American heartland. Novelist Marilynne Robinsons Gilead brings attention to a little known time in Iowa history when residents were actively involved in the Underground Railroad. Her protagonist, John Ames, recalls family stories of past activism from a hundred year vantage point. Due to the gradual, but pervasive homogeneity of his Iowa small town, Ames struggles with implementing his progressive, yet abstract ethics into practice. Ames journals about his specialized homing in memories, which show how Iowans have struggled with their past and present pursuit of equality and fairness. This essay corroborates Amess recollections with an investigation into place, society and the past, as it relates to rural Iowa communities, by exploring the causality of the states more liberal legislation and the tension created when actual application comes into play. Research of the past reveals that in the absence of historical touchstones common to other regions, Iowans must fall back upon local stories to create continuity. Robinsons Gilead follows unspoken customs in Midwestern storytelling by telling about real events, people, times and places. Gilead was published in 2004, yet Robinsons protagonist lives in 1956. Amess examination of the past, and along with his own struggles, caution of the dangers from resting on the laurels of ones forbearers. The invasion of a subconscious racism in 1956 Gilead offers a warning for todays society, which may have become complacent after the reforms during the 1960s. Yet the blessing Ames eventually is able to give his adult namesake provides a positive model of hope for the future to his young son and wife. Amess testimony encourages Iowans and readers in general about the value of contemplating past history since the stories in Gilead demonstrate a sense of eternal connection with humanity. Additionally, Gileads homing in memories and reflections maintain authenticity according to Iowa analysis while offering hope and encouragement to readers about the value of continuing to strive for fairness and empathy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09172009-080046/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the variability in the long term adjustment of child sexual abuse victims</field><field name="creator">Ulrich, Heather Marie</field><field name="description">Two meta-analyses (Rind, Tromovitch &amp; Bauserman, 1998; Ulrich, Randolph, &amp; Acheson, 2006) have suggested that the long held belief about the inevitable pervasive negative effects of child sexual abuse does not hold for college populations. The meta-analyses suggest that there is other factors in sexual abuse victims' lives that interact with their abuse experience to produce the sometimes-observed minimal long-term effects on psychological adjustment. This research attempted to examine a potential model for explaining the variability in the long-term effects of child sexual abuse by examining both moderator variables and abuse characteristics within the same population. The study examined three potential moderators, attributional style (including abuse specific attributions), family environment, and social support. Abuse characteristics were also entered in the moderator regression analyses, in order to examine the variance accounted for by each variable on long-term outcome beyond any shared variance between variables. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant difference between subjects reporting a history of sexual abuse and those without a history of sexual abuse on their long term psychological adjustment. This difference would be minimal, but would indicate that those without a history of child sexual abuse score better on a measure of trauma psychopathology. The second hypothesis was that attributional style, family environment, and social support would moderate the long-term outcome of child sexual abuse victims, beyond the variance accounted for by the abuse characteristics. The final hypothesis was that the accumulation of the aforementioned risk factors would result in a worse long-term outcome in college populations. This model attempted to provide an understanding of the relationship between each variable with long term outcome of child sexual abuse, as well as the cumulative effect of all these variables on the relationship of child sexual abuse outcomes. Results suggested that social support satisfaction and the victim's attributions about the cause of the child sexual abuse experience were related to trauma outcomes. In addition, the results provided potential indications for what to target in treatment based upon symptom presentation in child sexual abuse victims.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09202007-123302/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Democratic Administration in the United States Forest Service</field><field name="creator">Leifer, Nancy Leigh</field><field name="description">Pluralism, the dominant theory in citizen involvement in the United States Forest Service since the 1950s, has prolonged the process of determining the public interest by promoting the use of appeals and lawsuits. The advent of more collaborative public involvement strategies in the past fifteen years offers the opportunity to assess whether participatory democracy offers a better paradigm for determining the public interest. This research focused on four cases of reported successful collaboration in Region One of the Forest Service and involved in-person interviews with 17 Forest Service officials and 24 citizen and interest group leaders. The researcher translated pluralist and participatory democracy paradigms into characteristic human actions and behavior in the setting of Forest Service public involvement, then analyzed reported actions and behaviors accordingly. Interviewees were asked to choose between two contrasting descriptions of group culture to characterize interactions with the Forest Service, one drawn from the rational choice model in the pluralist paradigm, the other from collaborative literature in the participatory democracy paradigm. Collaboration was rejected as a term for analysis because it lacked specific definition among both Forest Service and public interviewees. Instead, the researcher analyzed the cases using characteristics of participatory democracy drawn from civic republican theorists that also encompassed the characteristics contained in textbook descriptions of collaboration. Two of the cases had all characteristics and provided empirical examples of participatory democracy at work. Another of the cases used stakeholder negotiation that contained some of the aspects of participatory democracy, but lacked the characteristics of being voluntary and of fostering a sense of community. The last case used informed consent and was found to be a combination of participatory culture and synoptic administration. Based on these cases, the researcher concluded that public involvement that uses a participatory democracy paradigm has the potential to increase public trust in the Forest Service and to minimize appeals and lawsuits by creating strong diverse support for Forest Service decisions. The research also examined characteristics of the leadership in the cases and found trust and integrity to be essential to creating a participatory democracy paradigm.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09202007-123734/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION OF WATER RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS IN THE BAGRAMI DISTRICT OF KABUL PROVINCE</field><field name="creator">Ahmad , Mumtaz</field><field name="description">My paper includes: (1) an analysis of cases of waterborne diseases in Bagrami District from 2003-2007; (2) a review and assessment of the effectiveness of three recent water supply and sanitation projects carried out by aid organizations; (3) a description of a Bagrami water sanitation project that I helped manage in 17 villages in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in spring 2008; and (4) my recommendations on how to improve the effectiveness of water supply and sanitation projects in Bagrami and other areas of Afghanistan based on insights gained from this study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09222008-022006/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN FORELAND BASIN: COMBINED STRUCTURAL, MINERALOGICAL, AND GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF BASIN EVOLUTION, ROCKY MOUNTAIN THRUST FRONT, NORTHWEST MONTANA</field><field name="creator">Ward, Emily Geraghty</field><field name="description">The sub-Middle Jurassic unconformity exhumed at Swift Reservoir, in the Rocky Mountain thrust belt of Montana, exposes structures that call for a re-evaluation of the deformation history at this locale. The unconformity separates Late Mississippian Madison Group carbonate (~340 Ma) from the transgressive basal sandstone of the Middle Jurassic (Bajocian-Bathonian) Sawtooth Formation (~170 Ma). Fieldwork established that northwest-trending, karst-widened fractures (grikes) are filled with cherty, phosphatic sandstone and conglomerate of the Sawtooth Formation and penetrate the Madison Group for 4 meters below the unconformity. Clam borings, filled with Sawtooth sandstone, pierce the unconformity surface, some of the fracture walls, and also perforate rounded clasts of Mississippian limestone that lie on the unconformity surface within basal Sawtooth conglomerate. Following deposition of the overlying foreland basin clastic-wedge, the grikes were stylolitized by layer-parallel shortening and buckled over fault-propagation anticlinal crests in the Late Cretaceous-Paleocene fold-and-thrust belt. The model proposes that the grikes record uplift and erosion followed by subsidence as the Rocky Mountain foreland experienced elastic flexure in response to tectonic loading at the plate boundary farther to the west during Early Jurassic; the forebulge opened strike-parallel fractures in the Madison Group that were karstified. The grike system contributes to the secondary porosity and permeability of the upper Madison Group; a major petroleum reservoir in the region. Grikes acted as fluid pathways during basin evolution as seen from the clay mineral assemblage and fluid inclusions contained within the grike fill. Mixed-layer illite-smectite (I/S) indicates that the grikes did not exceed 210&#8734; C (complete smectite-illite transition). The illite likely resulted from superstaturated fluids flushing through the foreland at the onset Laramide orogeny and may have been coincident with hydrocarbon migration. Hydrocarbon inclusions contained within the grike cements were trapped at temperatures ranging from 110&#8734;-170&#8734; C; correlative with the clay temperature calculations. Recognition of the fractures as pre-middle Jurassic revises previous models, which related them to Cretaceous fracturing over the crests of fault-propagation folds, substantially changing the understanding of the hydrocarbon system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09262007-094800/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of Trend Detection Methods</field><field name="creator">Gray, Katharine Lynn</field><field name="description">Trend estimation is important in many fields, though arguably the most important applications appear in ecology. Trend is difficult to quantify; in fact, the term itself is not well-defined. Often, trend is quantified by estimating the slope coefficient in a regression model where the response variable is an index of population size, and time is the explanatory variable. Linear trend is often unrealistic for biological populations; in fact, many critical environmental changes occur abruptly as a result of very rapid changes in human activities. My PhD research has involved formulating methods with greater flexibility than those currently in use. Penalized spline regression provides a flexible technique for fitting a smooth curve. This method has proven useful in many areas including environmental monitoring; however, inference is more difficult than with ordinary linear regression because so many parameters are estimated. My research has focused on developing methods of trend detection and comparing these methods to other methods currently in use. Attention is given to comparing estimated Type I error rates and power across several trend detection methods. This was accomplished through an extensive simulation study. Monte Carlo simulations and randomization tests were employed to construct an empirical sampling distribution for the test statistic under the null hypothesis of no trend. These methods are superior over smoothing methods over other smoothing methods of trend detection with respect to achieving the designated Type I error rate. The likelihood ratio test using a mixed effects model had the most power for detecting linear trend while a test involving the first derivative was the most powerful for detecting nonlinear trend for small sample sizes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09262007-104625/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elucidation of the Specificity of Neuroactive Steroids and Related Compounds at the at the Vesicular Glutamate Transporter</field><field name="creator">Smith, Wesley Edward</field><field name="description">As the primary excitatory amino acid, glutamate is essential to proper functioning of the mammalian CNS. Proper regulation of the synaptic release of glutamate, potentially regulated by synaptic vesicle content, is one of many critical aspects to normal excitatory functioning. In particular, the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs), which load synaptic vesicles with glutamate prior to presynaptic release of neurotransmitter, are distinct from that of the plasma membrane excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT). The development of a library of compounds which selectively inhibit the uptake of [3H]-L-glutamate into the VGLUTs, has revealed importance of particular structural motifs. Among these structural motifs, one of the most important is that of the "embedded glutamate" which mimics the endogenous substrate of the transporter. With respect to potency, the substitution of a lipophilic moiety at the C6 position seems to be the most important to date, as illustrated by 5,6-napthyl quinoline dicarboxylic acid (5,6-QDC). The structure of this compound strongly resembles that of a steroid molecule. In light of recent research suggesting steroids act within the CNS in a non-genomic manner, this observation prompted the testing of a panel of steroid molecules at VGLUT. These compounds, known as "neuroactive steroids" have been shown to be synthesized, modified, and/or active within the brain. Research from our lab, as well as from the Thompson lab, shows that certain sulfated neuroactive steroids are potent inhibitors of [3H]-L-glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles. This work identifies pregnenolone sulfate, along with 5,6-QDC, as competitive inhibitors of VGLUT (K i values of 107 and 228 &amp;#956;M, respectively). These two molecules display specificity for VGLUT, with respect to other sites on the synaptic vesicle (i.e., electrochemical gradient), and among other vesicular neurotransmitter transporters (i.e., VGAT, VMAT). Two molecules, 5,6-QDC and Congo Red Fragment (CRF) were aligned to the VGLUT Pharmacophore to illustrate the SAR of these compounds. Biochemical studies have also been conducted to delineate substrate activity of neuroactive steroids and related compounds at VGLUT. The specificity of certain sulfated neuroactive steroids suggest that they could be endogenous regulators of vesicular glutamate uptake.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

How these changed conditions influence individual life-history traits, and what particular factors spur increases in population abundance in the introduced versus native range, are not well understood. I conducted parallel experiments in both the native and introduced ranges of a widespread plant invader in North America, houndstongue (&lt;em&gt;Cynoglossum officinale&lt;/em&gt;). I combined these experimental results with demographic monitoring in each range, and population modeling, to explore how introduction has affected houndstongue demography and life-history evolution, and to determine the role of specialist herbivores and altered responses to disturbance in affecting plant population growth in both ranges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From reciprocal common gardens in each range, I found substantial population-level plasticity in size and fecundity between native and introduced populations of houndstongue, but no significant genetically based differences in morphology. Differentiation of native populations in the magnitude of plasticity were much stronger than that of introduced populations, suggesting an important role for founder effects. From demographic data collected in each range, I found that both survival and growth were higher in the introduced range, where size at flowering was larger and iteroparity more common. Since iteroparity conferred higher fitness in both ranges, my results imply severe constraints on the evolution of this life-history strategy in the native range, potentially because specialist herbivores select for plants that flower only once. Finally, results from manipulative experiments at multiple sites in each range involving suppression of insect herbivore pressure and creation of small scale disturbances revealed several important results. First, specialist herbivores reduced plant size and fecundity in Germany, but generalist herbivores had no effect on plant performance in Montana. Second, in both ranges, seedling recruitment responded positively to disturbances, but seedling survival was more positively affected in Montana. Integrating these results into integral projection models of population growth suggest that while escape from enemies may contribute slightly to the increased abundance of houndstongue in North America, it is the differences in response to small disturbances that leads to higher abundance in the novel range compared to at home. &lt;/p&gt;</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09302008-150625/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Greater Sage-Grouse Response to Coal-Bed Natural Gas Development and West Nile Virus in the Powder River Basin, Montana and Wyoming, USA</field><field name="creator">Walker, Brett Lincoln</field><field name="description">Understanding how population dynamics respond to landscape-scale disturbance and disease are crucial for effective wildlife management and conservation. Two new potential stressors on greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations in the Powder River Basin of Montana and Wyoming are coal-bed natural gas (CBNG) development and West Nile virus (WNv). I first examined how CBNG development, habitat, and other landscape features influenced trends in the abundance of displaying males and the status of sage-grouse leks. Second, I used rates of WNv-induced mortality and seroprevalence from radio-marked birds to estimate rates of WNv infection. Third, I studied the influence of female characteristics, season, and environmental variables on nest, brood, and female survival. I then used population models to estimate potential impacts of WNv on population growth. From 2001-2005, numbers of males on leks in CBNG fields declined more rapidly than leks outside CBNG. Of leks active in 1997 or later, only 38% within CBNG remained active by 2004-2005, compared to 84% of leks outside CBNG. By 2005, leks in CBNG had 46% fewer males per active lek than leks outside CBNG. Persistence of 110 leks was positively influenced by proportion sagebrush habitat within 6.4 km of the lek and negatively affected by CBNG development at multiple scales. Prohibiting CBNG development within 0.4 km of sage-grouse leks is inadequate to ensure lek persistence. From 2003-2005, minimum WNv-related mortality rates from 1 July-15 September ranged from 2.4-13.3% and maximum possible rates ranged from 8.2-28.9%. In spring 2005 and 2006, 10.3% and 1.8% respectively, of newly-captured females tested seropositive for neutralizing antibodies to WNv. Annual WNv infection rates were lower in habitats without CBNG development. Summer mortality from WNv occurred every year, decreased annual female survival rates by 0-27% per year, and reduced estimates of population growth by 7-10% per year. Changes in epizootiology of WNv and in distribution and management of surface water from CBNG development will play an important role in long-term impacts of WNv on greater sage-grouse populations in the Powder River Basin. Management should focus on eliminating man-made water sources that support breeding mosquitos known to vector the virus.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-09302008-161217/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chronic low-level Pb exposure during development alters proteins involved in energy metabolism in auditory neurons of the brainstem</field><field name="creator">Prins, John</field><field name="description">Low level lead (Pb) exposure is a risk factor for neurological dysfunction including ADHD. How Pb produces these behavioral deficits is unknown, but low-level exposure during development is associated with auditory temporal processing deficits, even though hearing remains normal. Pb disrupts cellular energy metabolism and efficient energy production is crucial for auditory neurons to maintain their high rates of synaptic activity. The voltage dependent ion channel (VDAC) is an ion channel involved in the regulation of mitochondrial physiology and is a critical component in controlling mitochondrial energy production. No studies to date have investigated the effect of Pb on VDAC, therefore the current series of studies examines the interactions between Pb and VDAC. In-vitro studies were used to delineate the effects of Pb on VDAC expression. Both differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and PC-12 cells exposed to 10 &#956;M Pb for 48 h result in a significant decrease in VDAC expression. Exposure to 24 h of hypoxia fails to decrease VDAC expression, suggesting this is a specific effect of Pb. In addition, a corresponding decrease in cellular ATP that is correlated with decreased VDAC expression occurs with Pb. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated a significant decrease in mRNA levels for VDAC1 isoform, suggesting that Pb decreases VDAC protein expression through decreased transcription. A proteomics approach was then used to confirm that Pb exposure during development results in changes in proteins involved in energy metabolism in auditory regions of the brainstem. CBA mice were exposed to 0 mM (control), 0.01 mM (low), or 2 mM (high) Pb acetate during development. At P21, the ventral brainstem region containing several auditory nuclei, including the Medial Nucleus of the Trapezoid Body, and the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, was separated from the total brainstem. Proteomic analysis (isolation and separation of proteins by 2D-PAGE; analysis by MALDI-MS) revealed that chronic Pb exposure alters the expression of proteins involved in the regulation of cellular energy metabolism including VDAC and creatine kinase B. Immunohistochemistry confirms that Pb exposure results in decreased expression of VDAC in auditory nuclei, supporting the hypothesis that Pb disrupts energy metabolism in auditory neurons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

Our working hypothesis was that lateral habitats are important to the cycling of energy and materials within the SHM and contribute greatly to the productivity and biodiversity of the floodplain ecosystem. We produce a quantitative description of temperature variation across aquatic and terrestrial habitats at Nyack. Thermal patterns across lateral habitats indicate vast differences exist between lateral habitats in habitat suitability for aquatic organisms over an annual cycle. Existing thermal regimes favor life history diversification. We further document the impacts of flood disturbances on organic matter accumulation by aquatic primary producers in off-channel environments. We were able to show that the annual flood pulse disturbance was the major force controlling periphyton community biomass, nutrient status, and species composition, with secondary control by surface and groundwater mediated water chemistry fluctuations during lower flow periods. We end with a study relating biodiversity pattern and process to lateral habitat heterogeneity. Data supported our prediction that densities and diversity of organisms and food webs of the flood plain would be greatly increased if off-channel habitats as well as main channel habitats were included. Collectively, lateral habitats uniquely support 50% of the total documented aquatic biodiversity of the entire floodplain. We conclude that lateral habitats contribute significantly to the biocomplexity of alluvial floodplain ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10012008-134442/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mindfulness as a Predictor of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptomatology in an Experiential Avoidance Model</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Brian Lantz</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of measures of mindfulness to predict the variance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) avoidance symptom severity above and beyond measures of experiential avoidance. A sample of 378 introductory psychology students completed questionnaire packets in individuals rooms to insure confidentiality of sensitive material. Based on a pencil-and-paper self-report measure of PTSD symptoms, the sample was divided into 3 groups: PTSD group (n = 44); trauma-no PTSD (n = 147); and a control (no trauma) group (n = 123). A fourth traumatized group was subsequently created consisting of individuals who endorsed a criterion A trauma, but who may or may not meet full PTSD criteria. Experiential avoidance measures of alexithymia and thought suppression were the most robust predictors of PTSD avoidance symptom severity, but mindfulness predicted more individual variance than measures of emotional coping, emotional intelligence, and a general measure of experiential avoidance. Although not as a strong a predictor of PTSD avoidance symptomatology as alexithymia and thought suppression, mindfulness appears to uniquely account for a significant amount of the variance of PTSD avoidance symptom severity.

A review of the related literature on this topic revealed several areas of consideration regarding teachers' curriculum change experiences which guided the data collection and analysis process: commitment, workload, capacity, collaboration, and perception of the teaching profession. This qualitative, within case study was designed to add to the body of quantitative research on curriculum change. Data collection sources include: pre and post interviews, observations, electronic journals, field notes, and document analysis. Five themes emerged from the data analysis of the participants' curriculum change experiences: support, time, motivation, adaptation, and student learning. A skyscraper depicts a visual model of the complex and inter-dependent relationship of themes in the curriculum change process as determined in this study. Each of the themes is presented in narrative format as a vignette giving voice to the teachers' curriculum change experiences. Overall, teachers are positive about curriculum change and look at it as an on-going process to improve curriculum in an effort to increase student learning. The conclusion offers several suggestions to ease the curriculum change process for teachers. Teachers need the support of the community, administrators, colleagues, and outside agencies for continued, successful curriculum change. Teachers need time and space for collaboration, planning, curriculum development, and knowledge building. Teachers need to be able to easily adapt curriculum materials to their own teaching styles and district curriculum guidelines. Teachers are motivated by what interests them and so are students. Curriculum developers and planners need to keep the interests of teachers and students in mind when creating curriculum materials and professional development. Students and teachers demand relevant, current, local examples to increase their understanding and reach the ultimate goal of curriculum change in the classroom: curriculum improvement and increased student learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum &amp; Instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10022009-140421/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Randomness In Tree Ensemble Methods</field><field name="creator">Elias, Joran</field><field name="description">Tree ensembles have proven to be a popular and powerful tool for predictive modeling tasks. The theory behind several of these methods (e.g. boosting) has received considerable attention. However, other tree ensemble techniques (e.g. bagging, random forests) have attracted limited theoretical treatment. Specifically, it has remained somewhat unclear as to why the simple act of randomizing the tree growing algorithm should lead to such dramatic improvements in performance. It has been suggested that a specific type of tree ensemble acts by forming a locally adaptive distance metric [Lin and Jeon, 2006]. We generalize this claim to include all tree ensembles methods and argue that this insight can help to explain the exceptional performance of tree ensemble methods. Finally, we illustrate the use of tree ensemble methods for an ecological niche modeling example involving the presence of malaria vectors in Africa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10092009-110301/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biosignature storage in sulfate minerals- synthetic and natural investigations of the jarosite group minerals</field><field name="creator">Kotler, Julia Michelle</field><field name="description">The discovery of jarosite on Mars in 2004 generated increased interest in the properties of the mineral related to the search for life on other planets. Several studies indicate that the formation of jarosite can be linked to biological activity on Earth and biomolecules such as amino acids have been found associated with terrestrial jarosite samples. A series of natural and synthetic investigations using different jarosite end-members has been conducted and is presented in this dissertation to investigate the possibility that jarosite can store biosignatures. Natural samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, elemental carbon analysis and laser-desorption Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LD-FTMS) and were found to contain the amino acid glycine. Synthetic experiments were conducted in which the different end-members were synthesized in the presence of glycine as well as the amino acid alanine and the amino acid breakdown product methylamine. These samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, LD-FTMS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Results of these experiments show that the detection of the biosignature and the effect that biomolecule has on the jarosite minerals is dependent on the end-member and indicate that the jarosite minerals are an excellent target for detecting potential signs of past life on other planets.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10092009-111138/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TEACHER, LEADERSHIP, AND CURRICULUM FACTORS PREDICTIVE OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN INDIAN EDUCATION FOR ALL</field><field name="creator">Lipkind, Erin Robin</field><field name="description">This study examines the teacher, leader, and curriculum variables predictive of student achievement in Indian Education for All (IEFA). IEFA, a Montana educational mandate based on Montana constitutional law, was first funded in 2005, and little research had previously been conducted on the effectiveness of implementation efforts. While compulsory, implementation had been piecemeal and wrought with misunderstanding, differences in opinion, prejudice, and questions about its legitimacy. The challenges inherent in the implementation of an ambiguous educational reform with no state-adopted curriculum or benchmarks for student achievement have become evident. With the dearth of research, it was not known how well students were learning what was mandated, nor was it known which precise variables impact or measure this learning. To determine this, second through fifth grade elementary school teachers and school leaders located in Missoula County completed a survey questionnaire, and Missoula County fifth grade students completed a student assessment based on the Essential Understandings of Montana Indians and the Montana Standards for Social Studies. Descriptive data provided information on mean fifth grade student IEFA scores, teacher and leader demographics, professional development participation, and implementation needs, and frequency of use of materials provided to all schools by the Montana Office of Public Instruction. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine if relationships exist between the predictor variables (teacher, leader, and curriculum variables) and the outcome variable (student achievement). However, none of the independent variables was found to have significant predictive value. Educators, including the Montana Office of Public Instruction, may use these findings to determine strategies that might most successfully impact IEFA implementation and to direct the course of further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Curriculum &amp; Instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10092009-134244/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the role of grief in the etiology of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in American Indian adolescents</field><field name="creator">Morsette, Aaron</field><field name="description">The prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is reported to be comparatively high in child and adolescent populations (Reinherz, Gaiconia, Leftkowitz, Pakiz, &amp; Frost,1993). However, recent research has suggested that there may be differing etiological factors, specifically, Child Traumatic Grief (CTG), that contributes to the development of PTSD symptoms in American Indian adolescents (Morsette, at al., 2007). First this study demonstrated that CTG symptoms predicted PTSD symptoms above and beyond that which was predicted by violence exposure. Second, it was found that CTG predicted depression above and that which was predicted by PTSD symptoms. Third, it found that grief was significantly correlated with PTSD symptoms. Similarly, grief was also significantly correlated with the depressive symptoms. Finally, using a two-tailed Pearson's Product mom$$ent correlation this study found there was no correlation between PTSD symptoms, grief symptoms, depressive symptoms, and American Indian student's Grade Point Average and absenteeism. However, a post-hoc analysis using a one-tailed Pearson's Product moment correlation indicated a statistical significant correlation between GPA and depression. Additional etiological models are explored. This study is the first to examine etiological factors of PTSD in American Indian adolescents. Additional qualitative research is necessary to better understand the contribution of grief in the development of PTSD symptoms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10122009-103451/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crossing the threshold: What motivates individuals who are actively abusing substances to enter treatment?</field><field name="creator">Peavy, Katherine Michelle</field><field name="description">Although there is an abundance of research in the area of substance abuse, much of it samples people who are already enrolled in treatment. The treatment seeking population may differ from people who are actively using substances. One aim of this study is to describe a sample of individuals who have not sought out treatment, but still actively use substances. Specifically, the investigators assessed 51 county detention facility inmates recently arrested on drug- or alcohol-related charges, examining the factors that both inhibit and promote treatment seeking. We hypothesized that motivation levels for seeking treatment would differ based on several factors: family and social distress, psychological distress, medical problems, severity of drug and alcohol abuse, and primary drug of abuse. Results demonstrated that high levels of psychological distress, as well as distress in one's family/social life, were related to higher levels of motivation for change. We also examined perceived barriers to treatment, which revealed that participants endorsed barriers related to motivation (lack of) and self-perception of drug use. The results of this study have implications for developing brief interventions that could help facilitate the entry of moderately motivated substance users into treatment settings. Shortening the gap between a person's introduction to substance abuse and entrance into treatment could prevent an escalation of substance use that would incur greater consequences, both to the individual user and to society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10122009-110506/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DISORDERED EATING, ANTIFAT ATTITUDES, AND BARRIERS TO TREATMENT IN COLLEGE WOMEN FROM URBAN AND RURAL AREAS</field><field name="creator">Pepper, Alison Christine</field><field name="description">Disordered eating (DE) is associated with physical and emotional consequences.

DUI offenders (n = 8) and heavy drinking college students (n = 13) mandated to treatment were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual at their respective agencies or an experimental video intervention in addition to their regular treatment requirements. Participants were assessed at baseline and at one-month following treatment. Participants in both conditions self-reported significantly fewer alcohol-related problem behaviors at the one month follow-up. A non-significant trend was found between the groups over time for alcohol-related problem behaviors; participants assigned to treatment as usual reported fewer alcohol-related problem behaviors at follow-up relative to participants assigned to the experimental video intervention. An additional non-significant trend was found for movement along the stages of change. Two participants who received the video intervention regressed to previous stage levels and one participant who received treatment as usual moved forward one stage. Most participants assigned to the video intervention reported increased insight into their own drinking behavior following the video viewing. Results from this study suggest that aside from increasing awareness about drinking behavior, the data do not support the use of video self-monitoring of drinking behavior as a treatment intervention for individuals with alcohol-use disorders. Future research may want to incorporate some modified components of the video intervention into existing motivationally-based treatments as a way to increase awareness about drinking behavior.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10132009-105341/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Educational Travel and Adolescent Development</field><field name="creator">Saitow, Ann</field><field name="description">Educational travel forms the basis for novel learning experiences that enhance adolescent development by enabling students to make choices about their own survival in an unfamiliar setting.

As a result, this has increased the amount of energy that is required to transport food from the farm to the table. The food supply chain links production to consumption. However, as food-miles increase, this link becomes obscure. The food supply chain can be described as having two very distinct parts: the conventional food supply chain and the alternative food supply chain. Business consolidation, and large-scale production, processing, distribution and retail characterize the conventional food supply chain. As a result of such economies of scale, the conventional chain is also characterized by standardization of knowledge. The alternative chain, on the other hand, is characterized by direct sales, small-scale production, processing and distribution and by a more transparent market. Certified organic foods began as an alternative to conventional foods. However, certified organic foods have increasingly been criticized for adopting similar business practices as the conventional system and thus travel the same lengths, if not further, than conventional foods. This study is a place-based approach that compares the food-miles and subsequent energy use of the two food supply chainsconventional and alternativethat provide food to retail grocery stores in Missoula, Montana. Energy use is estimated in gallons of diesel and the subsequent byproduct, or emissions, of transportation is estimated in pounds of carbon dioxide. Four of the highest selling retail grocery products; apples, bread, ground beef and milk, are classified into three different categories: conventional, non-local organic and other-alternative. The food-miles, subsequent fuel usage and emissions are also estimated for each of the four products. The study shows a remarkable lack of transparency in the conventional food supply chain and relatively low food-miles, fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions for the other-alternative products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-10252007-113605/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of scavenger receptor MARCO in particle uptake and lung inflammation</field><field name="creator">Thakur, Sheetal A</field><field name="description">Alveolar macrophages (AM) form the first line of defense against chronic inflammation caused by occupational exposure to environmental particulates such as crystalline silica (CSiO2). The chronic inflammatory process triggered by CSiO2 is known to culminate into a fibrotic response called silicosis in the human lungs. Previous studies have indicated the role of membrane glycoproteins called scavenger receptors in binding of environmental particles. The scavenger receptors are classified into different classes (A-H) based on their structure and function. Class A scavenger receptors are critical in uptake of variety of ligands such as bacteria, acetylated lipoproteins and are typically found on macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells. One of the members of this family is Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO). Recent studies have focused on analyzing the interaction between MARCO and inorganic particles such as CSiO2 and titanium dioxide (TiO2). Both in vivo and in vitro binding studies have identified MARCO as a key receptor in CSiO2 uptake and subsequent cytotoxicity in AM from C57Bl/6 mice. Further in vitro studies using a transfected cell line revealed that the 100 amino acid residues long cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain at the C-terminal end of MARCO is required for binding of inorganic particles such as CSiO2, TiO2 and amorphous silica (ASiO2). Moreover, individual particles bind to SRCR domain of MARCO with unique differences and have varying requirements with respect to need for divalent cations. Our studies demonstrate that physiological absence of MARCO in C57Bl/6 mice leads to a more robust inflammatory response following CSiO2 exposure as compared to wild-type mice. The results suggest that diminished clearance of CSiO2 particles from the MARCO-/- lungs exacerbates the lung inflammation. These findings demonstrate that the involvement of different regions of SRCR domain may distinguish downstream events following particle binding. Taken together, these data establish the role of MARCO in uptake of various inorganic particles and elucidate the protective role of MARCO in CSiO2-induced lung inflammation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

Specific benefits of attending a high school with a gay-straight alliance (GSA) have recently been published (e.g., fewer suicide attempts; Goodenow, Szalacha, &amp; Westheimer, 2006). However, it is unclear whether GSAs have any impact on substance use behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of attending a school with a GSA on sexual minority youths high school experiences, mental health, and substance use behaviors. A total of 103 heterosexual and 145 sexual minority participants were recruited for this study. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare sexual minority youth who attended a high school with a GSA (GSA+), sexual minority youth who did not attend a high school with a GSA (GSA-), and heterosexual youth (HET) to determine if differences in high school experiences, mental health, and substance use were present. Overall, the results indicated that GSA+ youth reported more positive school experiences, less problematic substance use, and less emotional distress when compared to GSA- youth. HET youth in this study had more positive outcomes compared to the sexual minority sample, with the exception of problematic substance use and high school GPA. The findings support considering high school GSAs as protective factors for sexual minority youth. The implications of these findings are discussed in further detail, along with the limitations of this research. Future directions for studying the potential benefits of attending a high school GSA for sexual minority youth are also provided.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-11252009-142330/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changes in forest structure and composition associated with unique land use histories: Implications for restoration</field><field name="creator">Naficy, Cameron Edwards</field><field name="description">Many contemporary semi-arid forests of western North America are denser and have a greater proportion of shade tolerant species relative to pre- Euro-American settlement. While many causes have been invoked to explain these changes, the active suppression of fire since the early 1900s has been the most widely studied and cited. However, widespread logging in western North American forests has often predated effective fire suppression and has affected a majority of semi-arid forests. The extent to which historical logging has contributed to uncharacteristically high densities and other changes in contemporary forests have never been adequately quantified. Therefore, true elucidation of the causes of departures of contemporary forests relative to historical conditions may be incomplete. I studied ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests of the Northern Rockies to address four main questions: 1) has historical logging exacerbated the effects of fire exclusion on forest density, structure and species composition?, 2) What is the magnitude of this change relative to that due to fire exclusion alone?, 3) in the absence of fire, which structural components in unlogged vs. historically logged stands are mostly responsible for deviations from reference ranges of variability?, and 4) what is the magnitude of such deviation in logged vs. unlogged forests? Based on a paired design (n=23 pairs) of logged, fire excluded stands with unlogged, fire excluded stands I found that fire excluded, logged stands were twice as dense as fire excluded, unlogged stands, and had higher numbers of small living and dead trees. While unlogged fire excluded forests generally experienced minimal to no departures relative to the range of stand densities observed in reference, fire-maintained stands, most logged fire excluded forests experienced substantial departures. Responses to the interaction of logging and fire exclusion varied by habitat type, with significant departures in Douglas-fir but not in ponderosa pine habitat types. The magnitude of the response was proportional to the intensity of historical logging. We suggest that unique restoration approaches are warranted for unlogged and logged, fire excluded forests and caution that fuel reduction and restoration policies which do not account for the legacy of logging may be ineffective in accomplishing their desired goals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12012008-173306/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Exploration of Hope in the Rehabilitation of Individuals with Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Kimpton, Tory Ann</field><field name="description">There are an estimated 5.3 million U.S. citizens living with disabilities caused by traumatic brain injury (Thurman, Alverson, Dunn, Guerrero, &amp; Sniezek, 1999).

This thesis seeks to contribute to a better understanding of community forestry education by examining a field educational program known as Landscape and Livelihood (LL) offered by Northwest Connections, a small community-based conservation organization in the upper Swan Valley of western Montana. Based on extensive interviews, observation and the authors own personal experience as a former LL student, the thesis documents the programs use of field ecological studies involving both scientific and local knowledge integrated with journaling, homestays, and involvement in Swan community activities such as fuelwood gathering and citizen science projects. Analysis of interview data was informed by key concepts and concerns from popular, place-based and process educational theories. The results suggest that the LL program contributed to students gaining a more nuanced understanding of and appreciation for rural people and their forest-based connections, knowledge and livelihoods, and a greater sense of joy, hope, and inspiration for participating in conservation related activities in the future. Swan residents who participated as homestay families gained validation of their local knowledge and role as community forestry educators and also experienced joy, hope and inspiration for the future as a result of their interaction with students and the LL field semester.

The addition of a carboxyl moiety at position 8 on guanine (creating 8-oxoguanine) was observed to change the binding affinity of the transcription factor for the &#234;B DNA sequences at each modified guanine site. The protocol used a p50 binding domain protein (residues 23 to 366 from the p50 protein) and a p50 mutant protein with a single amino acid mutation of the wild type histidine 67 to alanine 67. Both proteins were cloned as N-terminal his6-tagged proteins. These proteins were expressed and purified as active proteins. It is known that reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III) creates species such as chromium(V) and chromium(IV) which interact with and damage DNA. An oxidative event, such a chromium(VI) reduction to chromium(III) could allow a crosslinking of protein-bound DNA. Redox values suggest that oxidative damage can travel to guanine-rich sites, such as that of the consensus sequence of &#234;B DNA. This suggested a mechanism by which a chromium oxidative event could crosslink the DNA and protein into a binary complex without direct chromium involvement at the site of oxidation. Furthermore the protein, tightly bound to DNA, may compete with water to act as a nucleophile on DNA. This binary DNA-protein complex may be covalently linked and resistant to harsh conditions, allowing it to be visualized by HPLC or gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Under our conditions, no &#234;B DNA, either unmodified or modified with 8-oxoguanine, was found to be bound to the p50BD protein. DNA oxidation through chromium reduction was not found to result in crosslinked p50BD protein in a binary DNAprotein complex.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12042006-144459/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon Storage in Old-Growth Western Larch (Larix occidentalis) Forests of Western Montana</field><field name="creator">Bisbing, Sarah M</field><field name="description">Over the last 30 years, the structural development of western old-growth ecosystems has been of great interest in ecological research. As the loss of historical forested acreage in western Montana became more widely recognized, the preservation of frequent-fire old-growth stands became a focus of forest management. And, although old-growth studies are commonly found in the literature, few studies focus on long-term carbon (C) storage associated with interior old-growth. This limited understanding of the C storage capacity and patterns in old-growth forests of western Montana leaves little ability to evaluate the role of old-growth forests in ecosystem level C storage capacity. Further, there is a disconnect between old-growth definitions and old-growth management. Forest Service definitions for interior old-growth ecosystems inadequately describe the structure, composition, and function of these ecosystems, and definitions applied from the Pacific Northwest do not capture the unique qualities of old-growth of the Northern Rockies. In this thesis, I first present a review of existing literature on definitions and characteristics of old-growth ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest and contrast these with old-growth forests of the Northern Rockies. In the second chapter, I present studies undertaken to generate empiric data on C storage in old-growth forests of this region. Specifically, studies were conducted to compare ecosystem C of old-growth western larch (Larix occidentalis) stands to that of paired 30-40 year old second growth stands in western Montana. Old-growth forests were found to store nearly three times more C than second growth forests, with most of the difference coming from C stored in the overstory. Finally, the third chapter describes a web-based plant guide that simplifies the challenge of plant identification by eliminating the use of technical vocabulary, focusing instead on visually recognizable plant characters and providing students with a more user-friendly means of identifying specimens and obtaining species-specific information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12042008-143126/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPACT OF AIDS EDUCATION ON ADOLESCENT RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS</field><field name="creator">Iverson, Anna</field><field name="description">Modern sex education recognizes that adolescents need formal guidance and information regarding sexuality and sexual behaviors.

Participants were asked to "spend" a most valuable resource, time, in order to complete a computer-based task. Participants were asked to choose between two computer-generated selection boxes, each yielding a different delay-value. However, participants were given different feedback as to how each session progressed (i.e. whether ahead or behind) depending on the budget condition to which he was assigned. It was found that both males and females were sensitive to budget condition such that participants were more risk-averse under the positive budget condition and all participants were less risk-averse under the negative budget condition.

However, if the underlying mathematical model is assumed to have the form z = Au, where A is a linear, compact operator, the problem of minimizing the negative log-Poisson likelihood function is ill-posed, and hence some form of regularization is required. In this work, it involves solving a variational problem of the form u def = arg min u0 `(Au; z) + J(u); where ` is the negative-log of a Poisson likelihood functional, and J is a regularization functional. The main result of this thesis is a theoretical analysis of this variational problem for four dierent regularization functionals. In addition, this work presents an ecient computational method for its solution, and the demonstration of the eectiveness of this approach in practice by applying the algorithm to simulated astronomical imaging data corrupted by the CCD camera noise model mentioned above.&lt;/P&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12092008-133704/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSIDERING CONNECTIONS:RACE, IDENTITY AND LEADERSHIP IN PAUL BEATTYS THE WHITE BOY SHUFFLE</field><field name="creator">Yaksitch, Emily Monique</field><field name="description">Challenging those who have mistakenly reduced racial identities to an unchanging, fixed category, Paul Beatty encourages his audience to grasp the intersectional process of identity formation in his novel The White Boy Shuffle. Beattys creative imagination and high-academic vocabulary illustrate via the protagonist, Gunnar Kaufman, how to teach and motivate people to be agents of change in the communities, especially with educational opportunities. Beatty illustrates the successes and shortcomings of black leadership and the ways in which the leaders of the black community influence individuals and institutions. Depicting how minorities are marginalized in the educational system, media profits from the homogenization of blacks, and American political apparatus restricts dissenting opinions from minorities, Beattys text covers a variety of issues pertaining to how minorities are treated as second-class citizens in America. The White Boy Shuffle captures how the absence of racial identity discussion by minority leaders and dominant white society in education and leadership is a fatal flaw to achieving change. In an effort to learn and appreciate the complex historical evolution of race awareness, this thesis offers a critique of white America who have unfortunately reduced these multi-layered topics to a simple, inadequate conversation on race in literature. I argue that we must fully comprehend how the presence of institutional racism in the educational system impacts and influences minority youth. In doing so, I explore how minority leadership can positive impact racial identities and make effective strides toward equality in the 21st century.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12112007-160533/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Benefits of an Outdoor Adventure Program for Improving Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy and Reducing Problem Behaviors in Adolescent Girls</field><field name="creator">O'Shea, Kristen</field><field name="description">&lt;P&gt;The study assessed change in self-efficacy, self-esteem, and problem behaviors from pre-treatment to post-treatment and at 6-month follow-up for adolescent girls enrolled in an outdoor adventure program.

A variety of policies, laws, and regulations have rapidly been established that affect the National Park Service mandate and require the agency and individual parks to protect, preserve, and restore natural sounds. National Parks are grappling with how to manage the newly legitimized natural soundscape resource and this research provides some of the first significant knowledge of visitor experiences of park soundscapes and preferences for management policies. The role of the natural soundscape in visitor experiences was explored through both interview and survey data with the primary goal of documenting dimensions of the experiences of natural sounds. Findings from this research highlight that not only do the majority of winter visitors to Yellowstone National Park believe that natural sounds are important to their experience of the park, but that deep meanings and complexity characterize visitor perceptions of the role of the natural soundscape to the overall value of the park and influence perceptions of the role of mechanized sounds in the park. While differences among the three primary user groups (cross-country skiers, snow coach riders, and snowmobilers) do exist, the data reflects a much greater degree of common ground and general agreement on most issues related to the park natural soundscape that were explored in this research.&lt;/P&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12112008-123204/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attachment, Personality, and Conflict Behaviors in Romantic Couples: Examining Vulnerability to Depression</field><field name="creator">Harwood, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">&lt;P&gt;Major Depressive Disorder has been conceptualized from a number of theoretical perspectives. The present study aims to provide a theoretically integrated understanding of depression vulnerability. Cognitive and interpersonal theories of depressive vulnerability were considered simultaneously in a sample of undergraduate research participants. Study procedures included an attachment elicitation exercise, which was preceded by completion of a self-report measure of depressive and anxious affect. The attachment elicitation exercise was followed by self-report measures of relationship behavior, adult attachment style, cognitive vulnerability, depressive symptomatology, and additional self-report measures of affect. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that the effects of insecure attachment and cognitive personal style on relational behavior are complex. Anxiously attached, sociotropic individuals appear to utilize more passive-aggressive behaviors (i.e., negativity) to negotiate conflict and avoidantly attached, autonomous individuals reported engagement in more overt, distancing behaviors (i.e., negative escalation and withdrawal). Moreover, significant interactions between avoidant attachment and autonomy suggested that the greatest impact on behavior occurred when autonomy was high and avoidant attachment was low. It appears that avoidant attachment may suppress some of the negative emotional expressions or behaviors of highly autonomous individuals. Contrary to expectations, insecure attachment and cognitive personal style did not predict pre- to post-changes in depressive affect, although these relationships were significant for both pre-stress induction affect and post-stress induction affect. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.&lt;/P&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12112008-131225/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT): heterologous expression, proteoliposome, computational and mass spectral studies</field><field name="creator">Chao, Chih-Kai</field><field name="description">&lt;P&gt;Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are integral membrane proteins that uptake glutamate into synaptic vesicles and are involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission. Since VGLUTs were identified and cloned, efforts have been made to characterize their functional roles. However, due to experimental limitations, the structural features of VGLUT protein remain unclear. In an attempt to better understand VGLUTs, computational and biochemical approaches were employed to characterize them. Plasmid DNA encoding rat VGLUT1 was constructed, amplified and expressed in Pichia pastoris to produce VGLUT1 protein. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was employed to purify the protein for structural analysis by mass spectrometry and to develop a functional transporting system, VGLUT1 proteoliposomes. Transmembrane topology and homology models of VGLUT1 were generated by web-based and in-house programs. The computational analysis implies that VGLUT1 protein appears to have 12-transmembrane domains. Chemical and enzymatic cleavages and mass spectral analysis of denatured and proteoliposome-reconstituted VGLUT1 protein show that the experimental results are consistent with the computational models. These results provide basic insight into VGLUT protein structure for neuropharmacology studies related to glutamatergic neurotransmission.&lt;/P&gt;</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

In order to address this shortcoming in the geographical literature it was necessary to establish some rational points of reference to compare fort and personnel attributes of significant timeframes from 1800 to 1900. More specifically, once the distributional patterns were revealed, they were compared by using center of population, geographic means, point pattern analyses, base age, population, and historical backgrounds to definitively classify each periods Army fort attributes and to illustrate their distributional trends. The central results indicated that the distances between military presence and the US population during the one-hundred years were variable, but closely related to the social, political, and military atmospheres of those times. Furthermore, the trends discovered concerning the collective establishment of forts on the landscape show that base construction, during many periods, coincided strongly with well known concepts in US history: westward expansion, Indian Wars, and international conflict. Using the stated metrics for understanding the establishment trajectories over time, one can identify some concrete geographical relationships between not only Army bases and personnel, but also the US population as a result of this research. Since the literature regarding Army bases and personnel in the past has focused predominately upon emphasizing the historical or qualitative aspects of this topic, this research likely introduces an appealing, yet needed, spatiotemporal perspective on the historical geography of these forts in the contiguous United States.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Military Science</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12122007-143329/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE INFLUENCE OF MOTHERS CONCERNS FOR THEIR CHILDREN ON STAY-LEAVE DECISION MAKING FOR WOMEN EXPERIENCING INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE: A COMPARISON OF WOMEN WITH CHILDREN AND WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN</field><field name="creator">Hernandez Armstrong, Geniel Amelia</field><field name="description">Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) occurs in 10-69% of the worlds population (World Health Organization, 2002). Women are at much greater risk of experiencing IPV than men. Physical, sexual, and emotional abuse has a psychological impact, not only upon the individual, but family members and future inter-familial generations. The symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, such as feelings of helplessness and emotional numbing may impede a womans decision making and help-seeking activities. Additionally, it has been found that about half of women who experience abuse have children, and that children witnessing IPV are at a greater risk for abuse, behavioral problems, and psychological problems. The following study addresses how women consider their children in their decision making processes. Two-hundred semi-structured interviews were analyzed using NVivo8 computer software (2008), inter-rating reliabilities, and grounded theory. Themes regarding the stay-leave decision making process for women with children are presented. Additionally, quantitative analysis was used to examine significant differences between women with children and women without children on the variables of length of time spent in the relationship and on the severity of violence experienced by women. Results indicate that women with children remain in violent relationships longer and endure a higher frequency of severe abuse.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12132009-200651/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alaskan Eskimo and Polynesian Island Population Skeletal Anatomy: The "Pacific Paradox" Revisited Through Surface Area to Body Mass Comparisons</field><field name="creator">Leach, Wendy Nicole</field><field name="description">This project is an attempt to re-examine the Pacific Paradox, as proposed by Philip Houghton (1996), through various morphological measurements on two climatically different populations, Alaskan Eskimo and Pacific Island groups. The Pacific Paradox has been widely discussed, but research using direct comparisons between this Pacific population and cold climate groups has received little attention. The methods employed are those preformed by Ruff (1994), Ruff et al (1991, 2004, 2005) and Houghton (1996) to create the most accurate determination of overall body form in both populations. Eight measurements were used to construct variables to create an accurate portrayal of overall body shape. These measurements were taken on Alaskan Eskimo populations spread throughout the entire region of Alaska and on Polynesian populations from a wide variety of Pacific Islands. The overall comparisons demonstrate similarities in the two body mass estimations; the bi-iliac breadth measurement and maximum femoral head diameter, and in the overall stature to body mass ratios, except in the males, who are significantly different in every measurement apart from surface area to body mass ratios and stature to body mass ratios. Further studies on each population were conducted to determine the role of latitude or isolation factors on each population. Interestingly, the Alaskan group did not follow the stereotypical trend of cold climate adaptation based on latitude. In the female groups, the females from the lowest latitude had the lowest surface area to body mass ratios followed by the highest latitude group. The male groups followed the stereotype with the highest latitude group having the lowest surface area to body mass ratio but interestingly, the group from the lowest latitude had the next lowest ratio. Polynesian results illustrated somewhat similar body proportions throughout the region with only a few exceptions. Meanwhile, several individuals measured from the Polynesian collection could be considered part of Melanesia. Migration patterns, founder effect through disease frequencies, nutritional effects and cultural traits along with many other issues are presented when examining the similarities and differences the Polynesian population has in comparison to both the Alaskan group and the small Melanesian sample.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12152006-100028/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation of an XML-based user interface with applications in ice sheet modeling</field><field name="creator">Lande, Daniel Ross</field><field name="description">The scientific domain presents unique challenges to software developers.

In particular, he cautions against the growing popularity of political readings over political arguments. Compared with traditional arguments, readings are, Stow argues, poorly suited for liberal political discourse. To demonstrate this point, Stow challenges the political character of Richard Rortys reading of Pale Fire. In this essay, I dispute Stow's criticism of Rorty. My basic argument is that literary criticism (or "readings") can be politically significant and that Rorty's acknowledgement of this fact ties him to rather than separates him from, both the political and literary arenas. To make my point, I reconsider the reading of Pale Fire Rorty offers relative to the kind of reading of Don Quixote offered by Nabokov. By arguing that even the most "literary" of writers reads for political purposes, I hope to situate Rorty within a cultural space where the literary and political converge.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12162008-133459/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Snow Accumulation and Melt Timing at High Elevations in Northwest Montana</field><field name="creator">Gillan, Bonnie Jean</field><field name="description">The sensitivity of snowmelt driven water supply to climate variability and change is difficult to assess in the mountain west, where strong climatic gradients coupled with complex topography are sampled by sparse ground measurements. We developed a snowmelt model, which ingests daily satellite imagery and meteorological data and is suitable for application to areas greater than 1000 km2, yet captures important spatial variability in steep mountain terrain. We applied the model to the Middle Fork of the Flathead Basin, a 2900 km2 snowmelt-dominated watershed in northwest Montana. Time integration of the melt model yielded a history of snow water equivalent distribution for the years 2000-2008. We found that over 25% of the total annual snow falls above the highest measurement station in the basin, and over 70% falls above the mean elevation of the nine nearest SNOTEL stations. Furthermore, elevation lapse rates in snow water equivalent are variable from year-to-year and are not described by the poorly distributed ground measurements. Consequently, scaling point measurements of snow water equivalent to describe basin conditions leads to significant misrepresentation. Numerical melt simulations performed on the basins peak snow accumulation elucidated the control of temperature variability on snowmelt timing under modern climate and future climate projected by downscaled GCMs. Natural temperature variability affects snowmelt timing on the order of 4 weeks, and plays an even larger role in a warmer climate. Timing of melt in a large snowpack year was found to be more susceptible to natural temperature variability than in a small snowpack year. On average, snowmelt timing occurs 24 days earlier in our projected future climate, but the range of variability is such that an overlap of todays conditions occurs as often as 50% of the time.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Geoscience</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12162008-160418/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age Estimation of Fetal Skeletal Remains from the Forensic Context</field><field name="creator">Sanders, Jennifer Ellen</field><field name="description">This study tested the efficacy of the traditional method (Fazekas and Kosa, 1978) of aging fetal remains from the forensic context against ultrasound (Chevernak et al., 1998)and radiographic (Sherwood et al., 2000) methods to determine which was most accurate.

A burgeoning field of research and practice has emerged in the past two decades that attempts to address this growing interest. This field is diverse and identified with various titles, the most common being spirit at work, spirituality in the workplace, faith at work, and faith in the workplace. Because any cognates of the words spirit and faith are universally associated with religion, implementing any form of spiritual practice or orientation into a workplace setting comes with multiple challenges, not the least of which being the ways in which the concepts involved are communicated to organizational members. This paper examines such implementation in the context of communication, investigating the communicative strategies employed by practitioners and consultants in this area. Three interviews were conducted with practitioners who introduced spiritual principles to three separate organizations. Interviews were then conducted with the three organizational representatives with whom these practitioners worked. Emphasis was placed on investigating the approaches utilized by practitioners in their attempts to successfully communicate the subject matter, and on the perceptions of the organizational representatives regarding the effectiveness of the communicative strategies that were utilized by practitioners. The concluding section includes implications for practitioners and organizational leaders, as well as recommendations for future study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12162009-134759/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CAUSE SPECIFIC MORTALITY OF DESERT BIGHORN SHEEP LAMBS IN THE FRA CRISTOBAL MOUNTAINS, NEW MEXICO, USA</field><field name="creator">Parsons, Zachary David</field><field name="description">Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) are an endangered species in New Mexico. Many of the small, isolated populations of desert bighorn are declining, and factors affecting their growth rates include low lamb recruitment and high mortality of adults due to cougar predation. No one has previously reported cause-specific mortality rates for desert bighorn lambs. My objectives were to determine the causes, extent, and timing of lamb mortality in the Fra Cristobal Mountains, New Mexico, USA. I tested 3 capture techniques during 2001 and 2002: approaching lambs on foot and restraining them by hand; jumping from a helicopter and restraining them by hand; and firing a net-gun from a helicopter. I captured 6 lambs by hand on the ground, 4 lambs by hand from the helicopter, and 11 lambs from the helicopter with a shoulder-mounted and skid-mounted net-gun. No injuries occurred to lambs or capture personnel. The hand capture technique allowed me to capture very young lambs. I then monitored lambs for mortality, and examined carcass and site characteristics to determine cause. I found that the primary proximate cause of lamb mortality was cougar predation, followed by golden eagle predation. Coyotes and bobcats did not kill lambs. Although 1 lamb died from pneumonia, disease was not a critical factor affecting lamb recruitment. I measured habitat characteristics at sites where adults and lambs were killed by cougars and paired control sites, and derived habitat characteristics at predation sites, relocation sites representing used areas, and random sites representing available areas. Visibility was lower at predation than control sites, while slope, elevation, and ruggedness were lower at predation than relocation sites, and predation sites were closer to water and roads than random sites. I suggest selective cougar control of habitual sheep killers over the short term may be an appropriate management strategy to enhance the recovery of desert bighorn populations, while recognizing the importance of carnivore populations to ecosystem health. Wildlife managers may consider prescribed burning to reduce vegetation encroachment and increase visibility and forage quantity and quality. Additionally, assessment of desert bighorn and cougar use of artificial water developments would be beneficial.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12172007-115521/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHRONIC LOW-LEVEL LEAD EXPOSURE AFFECTS THE MONOAMINERGIC SYSTEM IN THE MOUSE SUPERIOR OLIVARY COMPLEX</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Tyler John</field><field name="description">Low-level lead (Pb) exposure is associated with behavioral and cognitive dysfunction. It is not clear how Pb produces these behavioral changes but low-level Pb exposure and learning disabilities have been associated with altered auditory temporal processing in both humans and animals. Temporal processing is used to decode complex sounds and to detect a signal within a noise background, and it is thought that neurons of the superior olivary complex (SOC) in the brainstem play a role in sound detection in noisy environments and in selective auditory attention. The SOC receives a catecholaminergic and a serotonergic innervation from the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe respectively. While the physiological role of the noradrenergic input has yet to be defined, serotonin is involved in auditory temporal processing. Because Pb exposure modulates auditory temporal processing, the serotonergic system is a potential target for Pb. The current study was undertaken to determine whether developmental Pb exposure preferentially changes the expression of serotonin within the SOC. Pb-treated mice were exposed to no Pb, 0.01 mM (very low) or 0.1 mM (Low) Pb acetate throughout gestation and through 21 days postnatally. Brainstem sections from control and Pb-exposed mice were immunostained for the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), serotonin, and dopamine beta hydroxylase (D&#946;H, a marker for norepinephrine) in order to elucidate the effect of Pb on monoaminergic input into the SOC. In addition, sections were immunolabeled with antibodies to VGLUT1, VGAT and VAChT in order to determine whether Pb exposure alters the glutaminergic, gaba-ergic, or cholinergic systems. Pb exposure caused a significant decrease in VMAT2, 5HT, and D&#946;H expression while VGLUT1, VGAT and VAChT showed no change. These results provide evidence that Pb exposure during development alters normal monoaminergic expression in the auditory brainstem.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CEHS</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12172007-145904/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Last Best Fish: will conservation and consensus save Montana's Arctic grayling?</field><field name="creator">Stumpf, Jonathan M</field><field name="description">not available</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School of Journalism</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12182008-103630/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antonio Fogazzaro and the Development of Liberal Catholicism in Modern Italy</field><field name="creator">Caldwell, Margaret Ashley</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the cultural and political development of Liberal Catholicism in modern Italy. The events of the Risorgimento had deprived the Catholic Church of her temporal power in 1860 after the Second War of Italian Unification. Pius IX then promulgated Non expedit. The encyclical refused to recognize the Kingdom of Italy and forbade Italian Catholics from participating in local or national elections in the new liberal regime. In fin de si&#232;cle Italy, the Church consistently pursued anti-nationalist, reactionary policies, but there were many Catholic laymen who believed that the survival of the Catholic Church in the modern world depended on her capacity to adapt to modern civilization. An analysis of the life and works of Antonio Fogazzaro illustrates one of the many possibilities for political Catholicism in fin de si&#232;cle Italy. Fogazzaro came of age during this revolutionary period in the Catholic Church, and through his most important novels, Daniele Cortis, Il piccolo mondo antico, and Il Santo, he offered Italian Catholics a way of thinking about political Catholicism in an ostensibly apolitical Church. After the publication of Il Santo in 1905, Fogazzaro received condemnation from the Congregation of the Index. In his ninety-three-page encyclical Pascendi di dominici gregis of 8 September 1907, Pius X then denounced him in the modernist controversy. Ultimately, Fogazzaro accepted the judgments of the Holy Tribunal and remained attached the Catholic tradition he revered. His works represent a departure from religious traditionalism and literalism as well as a move toward the development of liberal Catholicism in modern Italy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12182008-142030/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">COST ANALYSIS OF REQUIREMENTS, DESIGN, AND CODE REVIEWS AND HOW THIS IMPACTS THE COST OF QUALITY</field><field name="creator">Huston, Mark W</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the difference between accepted theoretical and real world return on investment of requirements, design, and code reviews. The differences have a significant impact on the cost of quality. The goal of this thesis is to examine the differences between two data sets (one derived from widely accepted software principles and one derived from real-world data) and draw conclusions about the effectiveness (cost vs. increase defect detection) of reviews based upon these analyses. This thesis will compare accepted relationships pertaining to cost per defect and overall project cost against actual data from a real world project in order to discover any significant differences. This research will also develop a cost estimation tool than may be used in future research to further develop the ideas and conclusions from this thesis. This author speculates that the cost benefit of reviews will decrease as the amount of time devoted to the review increases.

Near-surface vapor pressure deficit, soil temperature, and soil moisture are essential state variables for monitoring high latitude climate and estimating the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Methods are developed and evaluated to retrieve surface soil temperature, daily maximum/minimum air temperature, and land surface wetness information from the EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the Aqua satellite for eight Boreal forest and Arctic tundra biophysical monitoring sites across Alaska and northern Canada. Daily vapor pressure deficit is determined by employing AMSR-E daily maximum/minimum air temperature retrievals. The seasonal pattern of microwave emission and relative accuracy of the estimated land surface state are influenced strongly by landscape properties including the presence of open water, vegetation type and seasonal phenology, snow cover and freeze-thaw transitions. Daily maximum/minimum air temperature is retrieved with RMSEs of 2.88 K and 2.31 K, respectively. Soil temperature is retrieved with RMSE of 3.1 K. Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is retrieved to within 427.9 Pa using thermal information from AMSR-E. AMSR-E thermal information imparted 27% of the overall error in VPD estimation with the remaining error attributable to underlying algorithm assumptions. Land surface wetness information derived from AMSR-E corresponded with soil moisture observations and simple soil moisture models at locations with tundra, grassland, and mixed -forest/cropland land covers (r = 0.49 to r = 0.76). AMSR-E 6.9 GHz land surface wetness showed little correspondence to soil moisture observation or model estimates at locations with &gt; 20% open water and &gt; 5 m2 m-2 Leaf Area Index, despite efforts to remove the impact of open water and vegetation biomass. Additional information on open water fraction and vegetation phenology derived from AMSR-E 6.9 GHz corresponds well with independent satellite observations from MODIS, Sea-Winds, and JERS-1. The techniques and interpretations of high-latitude terrestrial brightness temperature signatures presented in this investigation will likely prove useful for future passive microwave missions and ecosystem modeling.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12192007-163830/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE SOCIALIZATION OF SEASONAL EMPLOYEES</field><field name="creator">Blevins, Maria Dawn</field><field name="description">This paper examines summer seasonal organizations to examine how they socialize employees in an abbreviated amount of time.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12192007-173901/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Methane Range: Coalbed Methane Development, Sage-Grouse protection, and The Ranching Way of Life</field><field name="creator">Hayes, Jonathan George</field><field name="description">Coalbed methane development has proliferated across much of the western United States. Campbell County, Wyoming, in the Powder River Basin is one area that has seem some of the highest amounts of this development, most of it occurring on land where the surface use is livestock grazing, resulting in conflicts over resource use. This thesis takes a grounded theory approach to understanding the meaning that the ranchers that operate on this land have attached to this development. In doing so, this paper argues that these ranchers form opinions and attitudes based on how CBM has affected the ranching way of life and not simply on the perceived opportunity for economic gain. It also argues that although objections raised by this population to the listing the Greater Sage-Grouse as an endangered species are largely framed as objections to the way in which scientific conclusions are drawn, this may be more representative of embedded cultural viewpoints thereby making efforts to resolve this conflict through further scientific research, futile.

Detecting biosignatures in outer space is one way this search is conducted. To understand the biosignatures to look for and study in space, it is useful to gain a better understanding of life in diverse environments on earth. This research tested the hypothesis that chemicals characteristic of microbial life can be detected and quantified in air above hot springs with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The stated hypothesis was refuted, as no chemicals of uniquely biological origin were detected with FTIR. A discussion of why no uniquely biological chemicals were detected with FTIR is presented. An analysis of chemicals seen in the infrared spectra, such as CO2, is given in the context of their possible biological origin. The results of the CO2 analysis indicate that the naturally occurring biomats are more complex than laboratory cultures and that the observable results of the behaviors of the two groups cannot be directly related. Lastly, other data collected (water chemistry and weather data for the springs) and the results of water analysis (ion chromatography and total organic carbon) are summarized. Acetate, propionate, and formate were present in some springs at low levels, indicating chemically the presence of microbial activity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12202006-152114/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobile Processing: Developing Appropriate Technology for Pastured Poultry Producers</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Sarah Diane</field><field name="description">N/A</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12212006-153821/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PILOT STUDY ON THE PREDICTION OF HEART ROT IN APPARENTLY SOUND WESTERN LARCH</field><field name="creator">Daenzer, Angela</field><field name="description">Since many cavity-excavating birds require trees with heart rot, managers routinely emphasize decayed trees in their snag retention prescriptions. Where too few trees are present with obvious indicators of decay, apparently sound trees are left to meet retention objectives. These trees may also contain decay, and may offer advantages in longevity and protection over more extensively decayed trees. Better information regarding conditions and heartwood decay-causing fungi important to heart rot in apparently sound trees would aid in retention decisions. We combined data from the 2003 Westside Reservoir and Roberts Fire burns with data from the USFS Forest Health Protections 10-year western larch (Larix occidentalis) merchantability study on the 2001 Moose Fire burn, all collected on the Flathead National Forest. We used dissection data from 284 apparently defect-free fire-killed western larch to predict the probability of heart rot related to tree age, diameter at breast height (dbh), elevation, aspect, habitat type, and sapwood-to-heartwood ratio. Fungi were isolated from trees with heart rot and identified through DNA analysis. We isolated Stereum sanguinolentum, Echinodontium tinctorium, Sistotrema brinkmannii, Antrodia serialis, Phellinus chrysoloma, and Fomitopsis cajanderi from trees in the three burn areas. All variables tested except elevation and slope were significantly associated with probability of heart rot (&#225;=0.05), with sapwood-to-heartwood ratio and dbh showing the highest predictive power through CART analysis. These findings support large tree diameter as a critical characteristic in retaining trees most useable to wildlife, as well as retaining heart rot-causing fungi, which have undergone marked declines in other parts of the world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12212007-090109/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INFLUENCE OF EMBRYONIC METABOLIC RATE AND INCUBATION TEMPERATURE ON INCUBATION LENGTH VARIATION IN NEOTROPICAL PASSERINES</field><field name="creator">Niklison, Alina Maria</field><field name="description">Variation in embryonic developmental periods influences fitness, but causes of interspecific variation are poorly understood. Allometry, for example, does not explain variation in incubation periods among neotropical passerines. Incubation temperature can explain some variation in developmental periods, but substantial variation remains unexplained. Here we examine two previously untested alternatives. Adult metabolic rates differ among species and similar differences among embryos may explain some variation in embryonic development rates; higher metabolism may allow faster cellular proliferation. Alternatively, metabolic rates are temperature dependent, and metabolic rates might respond differentially to temperature among species and compensate for differing incubation temperatures. These alternatives are untested across any taxa. Therefore, we examined them in tropical Venezuela by measuring embryonic metabolism at four temperatures in 15 passerine species with incubation periods ranging from 12 to 27 days. Embryonic metabolic rates responses to temperature were different among species even at constant embryonic age. Furthermore, species with lower average daily incubation temperature are less sensitive to changes in temperature than species with higher average incubation temperatures. Differences in embryonic mass specific metabolic rate among species explained a significant amount of variation in incubation periods after correcting for incubation temperature. Thus, differences in the rate of living as manifested through metabolism can influence developmental trajectories and deserve greater attention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wildlife Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12212007-143823/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSMENT OF WHITEBARK PINE SEEDLING SURVIVAL FOR ROCKY MOUNTAIN PLANTINGS</field><field name="creator">Izlar, Deborah Kay</field><field name="description">Whitebark pine (WBP) is a keystone species of Rocky Mountain alpine and subalpine areas. A pervasive non-native fungal disease (white pine blister rust), mountain pine beetle infestation, and successional replacement by shade-tolerant competitors following decades of fire exclusion have severely reduced whitebark pine and threaten these high-elevation ecosystems. Land managers are attempting to reverse whitebark pines decline by increasing regeneration of rust-resistant trees while restoring successional processes. Restoration efforts include the planting of whitebark pine seedlings and over 200,000 seedlings have been planted on National Forest, BLM and National Park service lands. In this Rocky Mountain (RM) study, select whitebark pine plantations were surveyed and seedling survival rates and ecological data collected. The purpose of this initial study was to determine overall survival rates for planted whitebark pine seedlings and to identify environmental conditions that have promoted high seedling survival. Data were analyzed at the site, plot and tree level. Microsites created by stumps, rocks and downed logs in close proximity to WBP seedlings greatly enhanced survival, seedling height and seedling growth during the first year after planting. Potential direct solar radiation was inversely related to WBP survival. Wet planting sites were detrimental to seedling survival. Results as to the effect of fire on seedling survival were inconclusive. However for 1st year seedlings it does appear that moderate, mixed or severe burning did result in much higher survival than unburned. To further understand the environmental conditions that affect seedling survival, an experimental planting was designed and monitored using the knowledge gained from the RM study. Seedling survival in this planting was statistically significantly associated with the presence of a microsite. And increased health of seedlings was associated with the presence of beneficial mycorrhizal associates. Only seedling located in burned or unburned whitebark pine communities were colonized with native fungi and colonization was higher for burned than for unburned sites. Whitebark pine seedlings are successfully being planted and it is possible to discern how different environmental conditions are affecting the survival, height, growth and health of planted seedlings.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12272007-124748/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Long-term Strenuous Exercise on Oxidative DNA Damage and Proteinuria in Humans</field><field name="creator">Yasuda, Nobuo</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study consisting of three projects was to determine the effects of long-term strenuous exercise on oxidative DNA damage and proteinuria in trained individuals. In the first project, four successive triathlons accompanied by long-term training in a triathlete was chosen as the experimental design and procedure. In the second project, repeated 5-h bouts of cycling exercise at 52 %VO2peak and a 40 km time trial with carbohydrate and potential antioxidant supplementation (fenugreek seed extract) were carried out with trained individuals. In the third project, a wildland firefighting three-day work shift was conducted with active duty military personnel. Assessment of oxidative DNA damage was based on urinary and muscle 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine. Post-exercise proteinuria was determined with several biomarkers including urinary total protein, albumin, beta2-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and creatinine. The overall results showed that there were significant whole-body DNA oxidation and post-exercise proteinuria after the half- and full-Ironman triathlon races, but these levels gradually returned to baseline. In contrast, no significant alterations were observed in either oxidative DNA damage at the muscle and tissue level or proteinuria after the 5 h of cycling exercise at 52 %VO2peak and the 40 km time trial. Arduous work during wildland fire suppression induced proteinuria, which tended to be accumulated as the work shift progressed. These findings indicate that moderate exercise may not reach the threshold to cause oxidative DNA damage and proteinuria, whereas long-lasting strenuous exercise appears to induce oxidative DNA modification and exceed normal range of urinary protein excretion.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12282007-160926/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of Sodium Arsenite in Atherogenesis</field><field name="creator">Pereira, Flavia Elias</field><field name="description">Epidemiological studies as well as controlled animal studies have associated exposure to arsenic through drinking water with the development of atherosclerosis. In this study, we have shown for the first time that low and environmentally relevant concentrations of arsenic accelerate atherogenesis. The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of arsenic-induced atherosclerosis by (1) characterizing the time- and concentration-dependent effects of sodium arsenite [As(III)] on the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- /LDLr-/- mice, (2) determining whether As(III)-induced peroxynitrite activates protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes, &#945; and &#946;, in human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and (3) determining the effects of activation of PKC isotypes, &#945; and &#946;, on the endothelial barrier. Accordingly, exposure of ApoE-/- /LDLr-/- mice to As(III) in drinking water showed an increasing trend in atherosclerotic plaque formation in as early as 5 weeks within the innominate arteries. Most remarkable was the evidence that environmentally relevant concentrations of As(III) resulted in significant increase in plaque formation. Initiation of atherosclerosis results from activation/dysfunction of the vascular endothelium that maintains a semipermeable barrier between the blood and vessel wall. To elucidate the mechanism of arsenic-induced atherosclerosis, we analyzed the effect of As(III) on the endothelial monolayer integrity. Endothelial barrier is maintained by proteins of the adherens junction (AJ) such as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and &#946;-catenin, and their association with the actin cytoskeleton. Treatment of HAECs with As(III) resulted in reorganization of actin filaments into stress fibers and non-uniform VE-cadherin and &#946;-catenin staining at cell-cell junctions. Intercellular gaps were observed with a measured increase in endothelial permeability. In addition, an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (PY) of &#946;-catenin was observed. These effects were mediated through As(III)-induced activation of PKC&#945; without peroxynitrite formation. No change in PKC&#946; levels was detected with As(III) treatment. Inhibition of PKC&#945; restored VE-cadherin and &#946;-catenin staining at cell-cell junctions and abolished the formation of intercellular gaps and stress fibers. Endothelial permeability and PY of &#946;-catenin were also reduced to basal levels. These results demonstrate that As(III) induced activation of PKC&#945; causes PY of &#946;-catenin and formation of stress fibers. PY of &#946;-catenin causes weakening of the AJ and this in association with the contractile force generated by stress fibers results in gap formation and increased endothelial permeability. This could potentially accelerate the development of atherosclerosis by increasing the accumulation of oxidized low density lipoproteins and monocytes into the neo-intima of the blood vessel. The findings in this study demonstrate that arsenic disrupts the endothelial monolayer by activation of PKC signaling. Damage to the endothelium plausibly accelerates the process of atherosclerosis at an early stage as evidenced by the increase in atherosclerotic plaques in the ApoE-/- /LDLr-/- mouse model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Department of Biomedical &amp; Pharm.

It was intended to produce one single, dynamic, classification and mapping system for existing vegetation that could rely on commonly available inventory and remote sensing data. This classification and mapping system was intended to provide the analytical basis for resource planning and management. The problems encountered during the first phase of the original design transformed this project into an extensive analysis of the nature of these problems and a decade-long remote sensing applications development endeavor. What evolved from this applications development process is a portion of what has become a "system of systems" to inform and support natural resource management. This dissertation presents the progression of work that sequentially developed a suite of remote sensing applications designed to address different aspects of the problems encountered with the original project. These remote sensing applications feature different resource issues, and resource components and are presented in separate chapters. Chapter one provides an introduction and description of the project evolution and chapter six provides a summary of the work and concluding discussion. Chapters two through five describe remote sensing applications that represent related, yet independent studies that are presented essentially as previously published. Chapter two evaluates different approaches to classifying and mapping fire severity using multi-temporal Landsat TM data. The recommended method currently represents the analytical basis for fire severity data produced by the USDA Forest Service and the US Geological Survey. Chapter three also uses multi-temporal Landsat data and compares quantitative, remote-sensing-based change detection methods for forest management related canopy change. The recommended method has been widely applied for a variety of forest health and disaster response applications. Chapter four presents a method for multi-source and multi-classifier regional land cover mapping that is currently incorporated in the USDA Forest Service Existing Vegetation Classification and Mapping Technical Guide. Chapter five presents a study using nearest neighbor imputation methods to generate geospatial data surfaces for simulation modeling of vegetation through time and space. While these results have not yet been successful enough to support widespread adoption and implementation, it is possible that these general methods can be adapted to perform adequately for simulation modeling data needs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">College of Forestry and Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12282007-164513/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negotiated Forgiveness in Parent-Child Relationships: Investigating Links to Politeness, Wellness and Sickness</field><field name="creator">Geist, Jennifer Lynn</field><field name="description">Upon experiencing conflict in a relationship, individuals have a variety of response options. While one can seek revenge or avoid that person, another option forgiveness can repair the relationship and foster health for both relationship partners. In coming together to confront the conflict and move beyond it, relational partners negotiate forgiveness in interpersonal interactions to accommodate face needs. In doing so, individuals must communicate by seeking forgiveness from and granting it to their relational partners. While much research has pointed to the health benefits associated with forgiving, little has explored the role communicating specifically plays in later received health. In an effort to expand upon previous research, this study was conducted to confirm the presence of forgiveness communication strategies found in romantic relationships by Kelley and Waldron (2005) and Waldron and Kelley (2005) in forgiveness interactions experienced between parents and children. One-hundred-forty-eight young adult-children completed self-report surveys measuring forgiveness communication behaviors used in forgiveness interactions with their parents. All of the strategies evident in previous research were present in the current study. However, the specific way of communicating forgiveness had little to no association with later health. Conclusions are drawn based on an evaluation of the forgiveness communication strategies and facework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.umt.edu/theses/available/etd-12302007-231119/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of human activity on bighorn sheep in Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Ostovar, Kayhan</field><field name="description">Seventeen years have passed since bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis canadensis) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) experienced a massive Chlamydial-caused die-off. Currently, no sign of Chlamydia or pneumonia is evident, thus other factors are considered to be limiting the population. The proposed changes to the Gardiner-Mammoth highway and the highway through Dunraven Pass could increase or decrease human disturbances to the core population of bighorn sheep. Approximately 65% of all observations on the Everts winter range occurred on the top of McMinn Bench (along the proposed road route). One ewe group currently must cross the Gardiner-Mammoth highway to reach spring lambing grounds. The placement of the road onto McMinn Bench would impact at least 2 other populations of ewe groups and 2-3 populations of ram groups, which seek shelter, security, water, and minerals in the cliffs.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/1998/ostovar/OstovarK1298.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiographic Components of Trail Erosion</field><field name="creator">Godwin, Ian Chandler Paterson</field><field name="description">No previous study has sought to discriminate between soil erosion and soil compaction when explaining the "missing" cross-sectional areas of incised trails, assuming instead that erosion was the dominant process. Separating the two processes of erosion and compaction is critical to understanding the relationship between physiographic variables and the structure of trails. The purposes of this project are to estimate the relative effects of compaction and erosion on trail cross sectional area along the New World Gulch Trail, Montana, and to better understand the relationship between erosion, compaction, local topography, vegetation, soil bulk density, and soil texture. The following hypotheses were addressed: 1) adjusting the incised cross sectional area of a trail, by removing the effects of soil compaction, will increase the amount of variance in erosion explained by collected physiographic variables; and 2) inclusion of soil bulk density and soil texture as physiographic variables will increase the amount of variance in cross-sectional area explained along the trail. The goals of this study required the collection of field data, analysis of soil samples, and statistical analysis of data. Soil samples and other field measurements were collected over several months during the summer and fall of 1994. Some of the topographic information used in the statistical analysis originated in Urie's (1994) study of recreational trails. The determination of trail slope as one of the primary components of trail incision is consistent with previous studies. Soil water content is the second most significant independent variable when the percentage of particle sizes are not considered. Percent vegetative cover is also significant in the stepwise regression, although it is not significantly correlated to cross-sectional area. The most significant variable added to those already studied was soil bulk density. When individual variables were regressed against the measured cross-sectional area, off-trail soil bulk density accounted for the second greatest amount of variance (r&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; = 0.12) after trail slope (r&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; = 0.35). The ratio of on-trail soil bulk density to off-trail soil bulk density, which could be considered a measure of compaction, accounted for even more variance (r&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; = 0.18) than soil bulk density.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2000/godwin/GodwinI_00.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Return Map Characterizations of Singular Solutions for a Model of Bursting with Two Slow Variables</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Roger Evan</field><field name="description">Various physiological systems display bursting electrical activity (BEA).

In this dissertation a model with two slow and two fast variables is presented. For some parameter values the system has stable equilibria while for other values there exist bursting solutions. A singular construction of the latter solutions corresponds to the existence of a fixed point of a one dimensional map. The map is the composition of two maps derived from the slow-subsystem and averaged fast-subsystem. In a degenerate case this fixed point is determined.

First ever comprehensive study of TPA properties of tetrapyrrolic molecules is conducted in this work. Two-photon transitions in two key spectral regions, red to green and blue to near-UV (transition wavelengths) are investigated. Physical mechanisms leading to enhancement of TPA cross section in tetrapyrroles are elucidated. Porphyrin molecules with greatly enhanced two-photon cross sections are obtained. Spectral coherence interference gratings are created by means of two-photon excitation with pairs of phase-locked femtosecond pulses in tetrapyrrolic molecules. First, gratings are detected by means of persistent spectral hole burning, which constitutes the first ever demonstration of spectral hole burning by simultaneous absorption of two photons. Next, the gratings are detected in fluorescence spectrum, which we use to study zero-phonon lines and phonon sidebands in two-photon transitions. Application of tetrapyrrolic molecules to two-photon photosensitization of singlet molecular oxygen is investigated. First, TPA properties of some known one-photon photosensitizers are investigated. Then, a new class of TPA based photosensitizers with greatly enhanced two-photon cross sections is developed. The generation of singlet molecular oxygen upon two-photon excitation of the new photosensitizers demonstrated for the first time, which opens up new perspectives for two-photon photodynamic therapy.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2003/karotki/KarotkiA03.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sinc-Galerkin Method for Problems in Oceanography</field><field name="creator">Koonprasert, Sanoe</field><field name="description">The model for a wind-driven current with depth-dependent eddy viscosity is developed as a complex velocity formulation and a coupled system formulation.

Although research on grandparent caregivers is increasing, there remains little research that addresses the challenges and issues facing grandparents raising grandchildren in rural locales. To address this shortcoming, this study examines the parental stressors experienced by rural grandparent caregivers and explores individual, parental, and community level factors that may be related to stress including length of time in the primary caregiver role, grandparents's income level, psychological well-being, parental confidence, and perceived social support. Eighty-three grandparents raising their grandchildren were recruited for this study from across the state using purposive and snowball sampling techniques. Respondents were asked to fill out a survey about their experience raising their grandchild(ren). A total of forty-four grandparents participated in this study. Data indicate that as grandparents continue in the parenting role, their parental confidence and perceived social support increases. Significant differences were noted between American Indian and Caucasian caregivers. For example, American Indian caregivers reported experiencing significantly more time in the caregiving role, reported lower incomes, and experienced more depressive symptoms than their Caucasian counterparts. The best predictors of parental stress were depression and parental confidence. As depression increased, stress likewise increased. As parental confidence increased, parental stress decreased. These findings hold important implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/conway/ConwayM1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Productive Iteration in Student Engineering Design Projects</field><field name="creator">Costa, Ramon</field><field name="description">Iteration in design has different meanings, ranging from simple task repetition to heuristic reasoning processes. Determining productive iterations is important to improve the design process on cost, time, and quality, but currently there is no categorization of iterations conducive to this goal. After exploring the possible causes and attempts to address them, I propose to classify iterations as rework, design, or behavioral. The framework suggests that design teams, to improve productivity, should try to eliminate rework by increasing the resolution of design information (design iterations) without skipping design levels and by developing alternative solutions (behavioral iterations) in parallel before selecting one. Analysis of journal data from twelve student projects helps identify design processes that achieve higher quality in less time. Factor analysis groups common variability into factors. A multivariate linear regression model of three factors explains 91% of productivity variance within the study sample. Factor scoring coefficients are then used to translate the regression model coefficients back to activities and design levels. Results indicate that generating ideas and defining the problem at a system level are the key discriminating variables between more or less productive design teams in the sample, which supports the recommendation of increasing the resolution of design information without skipping intermediate levels. If we consider selecting an alternative for the final solution as the main design decision students make in the sample projects, then work on non-selected alternatives before selecting the final design can be used as a proxy for effort allocated to behavioral iterations. A linear model using work on non-selected alternatives shows that generating ideas at a system level relates to higher productivity while refining design details and evaluating existing design configurations associate with lower productivity. Then behavioral iteration relates to higher productivity only if alternatives are developed to the system level by generating ideas on how to address interface and configuration issues. The framework presented in this thesis helps differentiate between productive and less productive iteration patterns and provides guidelines to prevent rework by allocating more effort in productive iteration, namely behavioral and design iteration.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/costa/CostaR0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions of the Montana Land Grant System Held by Legislators and Faculty</field><field name="creator">Duffey, Lisa Marie</field><field name="description">A survey was conducted to determine the perceptions of the agricultural components of the Montana land grant system: College of Agriculture (COA)/Agricultural Experiment Station (AES) and Extension Service (ES), held by Montana legislators and faculty working in the system. Surveys were mailed to 150 legislators (85 returned) and 198 faculty members (85 returned). Responses were analyzed using SPSS 12.0. Results found that legislators and faculty preferred an administrative structure with one leader for all three components of the agriculture land grant system. Overall, both populations agreed with the nine assumptions defined by the Montana land grant system leadership that served as the foundation for the strategic plans. There was agreement between the two groups with the stated goals of COA/AES and ES. A large number of "Don't Know" responses by legislators indicated a need for improved communication with them about the goals of the land grant system. Both populations identified high levels of success in offering quality scholarly activity, conducting high quality research, and developing the confidence, competence, and character of the state's youth. Significant differences in perceptions of success were found between the two groups for goals such as being accountable to the state's citizens, strengthening Montana's families and communities, and helping people understand stewardship. Priorities identified by the respondents for 2010 included funding for COA, crops and economics for AES, and communication and staffing for ES. Personal contacts and agricultural publications were the primary sources of information about agricultural issues for faculty, while legislators turned to daily newspapers and agricultural publications. During the legislative session, legislators look to agricultural lobbyists, other legislators, and constituents for information about agricultural issues. Results indicate a breakdown in communication between the land grant system and Montana legislators and, in some cases, faculty employees of the system that needs to be addressed to ensure the successful future of the Montana land grant system and Montana agriculture. Changes to the form and function of the land grant system and its relationship with the Legislature are recommended to address the needs of Montana agriculture and Montana's citizens.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/duffey/DuffeyL04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy of Staphylococcus epidermidis Biofilms</field><field name="creator">Gjersing, Erica Lee</field><field name="description">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) microscopy is well-suited for investigating living systems since it is innocuous and non-invasive. In addition to imaging internal structures of systems, NMR microscopy techniques can be used to obtain information about transport phenomena, such as fluid velocities and diffusion. The goal of this research was to determine the applicability of NMR imaging techniques to studying transport properties in biofilms. Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms were investigated because of their importance in medical implant infections. NMR experiments were used to image biofilm structure and the fluid flow patterns in one millimeter square glass capillaries. Results showing the heterogeneous structure of biofilms are congruent with confocal laser microscopy images. The advantage of using the NMR techniques to image biofilm structures is that there are no light or laser penetration barriers and the innermost regions of the structures can be easily revealed. In addition to imaging the biofilms, velocity distributions have been mapped for the one millimeter capillary system. Laminar flows in clean, square capillaries display axial velocities that are both uniform and symmetrical while non-axial components of velocity are not present. In contrast, a biofilm fouled capillary displays irregular flow patterns in the axial direction along with distinct non-axial secondary flow perturbations. These results demonstrate that biofilms impact bulk flow in ways that cannot be ignored when modeling their impact on transport in bioreactors and medial devices. This work establishes NMR microscopy as an important biofilm research tool which can spatially resolve structural characteristics and transport processes in biofilm fouled systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/gjersing/GjersingE04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Missing Text Reconstruction</field><field name="creator">Glassy, Louis Zoe</field><field name="description">Missing-text reconstruction (MTR) is a new application of text-oriented pattern recognition.

Literature suggests there are many benefits associated with formation of a social support network including improvement of health status but few childhood cancer survivors have had the opportunity to form these networks. The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an increase in reports of social support after attending an oncology camp. A non-random convenience sample of 18 to 25 year olds with a diagnosis of cancer attending a weeklong oncology camp were selected to participate in the research. Participants completed surveys containing the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Support Survey, RAND 36-Item Health Survey Questionnaire 1.0, and qualitative questions at the beginning and end of camp. Comparison of pre-camp and post-camp mean scores on the MOS Social Support Survey were statistically significant for one scale only, tangible support within a particularly vulnerable sub-sample of participants. An increase in all means was observed when pre-camp and post-camp results were compared. These results suggest that cancer camp may be an effective intervention for establishing a social support network and benefit overall health and wellbeing. The implications for nursing include implementation of interventions designed to increase social networks of children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer as well as encouraging camp attendance.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/handley/HandleyS0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance of Wheat Germplasm in Competitive Versus Non-Competitive Conditions</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Kelly Anne</field><field name="description">Selection of high yielding spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes, is the goal for most classical breeding programs in the United States.

The first objective of this study was to determine the correlations between physiological traits and yield influencing traits to final crop yield. The second objective was to determine if there are correlations between physiological and yield influencing traits in space versus dense seeded spring wheat. A replicated field trial was grown in Bozeman, Montana over two successive years. The trial was done to correlate physiological traits and yield components to the plot weight of 20 different spring wheat varieties. Space and dense seeded conditions were used to determine if physiological and yield trait data from a space seeded plot correlated to a densely seeded plot. The data shows that many of the physiological and yield influencing traits are correlated to spring wheat yields. Also, many of these traits correlate between space and densely seeded plots. This experiment also shows that screening for key traits, such as grain fill period, harvest index, and leaf width, could significantly aid selection of space planted breeding material for yield potential in a single seed descent breeding program.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/hansen/HansenK04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Steller Sea Lion (Eumetopias jubatus) Decline and the Gulf of Alaska / Bering Sea Commercial Fishery</field><field name="creator">Hennen, Daniel Reneau</field><field name="description">The Steller sea lion (SSL) population in Alaska was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 1991. Several procedural restrictions were placed on the commercial fisheries of the region at that time in an effort to reduce the potential for human induced mortality on sea lions. Several years have elapsed since these restrictions were put into place and questions about their efficacy abound. In an effort to determine whether or not fisheries interventions have helped the SSL population to recover, estimates of the fishing activity of the Bering Sea/ Gulf of Alaska commercial fisheries in the vicinity of individual Steller sea lion rookeries and SSL population trends at those rookeries were made using data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Fisheries Observer Program and Steller Sea Lion Adult Count Database. Fisheries data from 1976 - 2000 were analyzed in relation to SSL population counts from 1956 - 2001, at 32 rookeries from the endangered Western Stock. Linear regression on the principal components of the fisheries data show that a positive correlation exists between several metrics of historical fishing activity and SSL population decline. The relationship is less consistent after 1991, supporting a hypothesis that fishing closures around some of the rookeries have been effective in moderating the localized effects of fishing activity on SSL.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/hennen/HennenD1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural Residential Development in the Greater Yellowstone: Rates, Drivers, and Alternative Future Scenarios</field><field name="creator">Hernandez, Patricia Cristina</field><field name="description">Rates of immigration and rural land use change in the American West have far exceeded the national average, and have been exceptionally rapid in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Because the Greater Yellowstone is ecologically unique, is still largely undeveloped, and is characterized by unrestrictive land use policies, it is a particularly relevant place to study past and potential future growth in rural residential development. The scientific approach used to investigate trends in rural residential development involved the both the testing of specific hypotheses regarding historical development patters, as well as exploratory statistical analyses. Growth in rural residential development was quantified according to data collected from County Tax Assessors offices. Generalized linear models were used to examine recent drivers of growth. The results of these analyses were used to parameterize a spatially explicit simulation of future rural residential development. Our study reveals that immigration and rural development within the Greater Yellowstone has been strongly influenced by a number of socio-economic and bio-physical factors including agricultural suitability, transportation and services, natural amenities, and encroaching development. We also quantified the extent to which towns of various typologies influenced residential development in adjacent rural areas. The Rural Development Simulator was based on historical rates and patterns of growth, and was used to forecast alternative scenarios of rural housing for the year 2020. The forecasted increase in rural housing ranged from 27% in a low growth scenario, to 82% in a status quo scenario, and 234% in a boom scenario. Existing land use policies were shown to have a limited impact on the forecasted distribution of homes. An alternative growth management scenario was designed in which strategic configurations of zoning districts and conservation easements were shown to protect ecologically valuable areas without limiting future regional growth. Although the possibility exists for substantial social and ecological change in rural landscapes of the Greater Yellowstone, our findings highlight the potential for local policy decisions to effectively manage growth in rural residential development.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/hernandez/HernandezP04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Puroindolines: Their Control Over Wheat Grain Hardness and Influence on Milling and Bread Baking Traits</field><field name="creator">Hogg, Andrew Charles</field><field name="description">Wheat grain is sold based upon several physiochemical characteristics, one of the most important being grain texture. Grain texture in wheat directly affects many end use qualities such as milling yield, break flour yield, and starch damage. The Hardness (Ha) locus located on the short arm of chromosome 5D is known to control grain hardness in wheat. This locus contains the puroindoline a (pina) and puroindoline b (pinb) genes. All wheats to date that have mutations in pina or pinb are hard textured, while wheats possessing both the 'soft type' pina-D1a and pinb-D1a sequences are soft. Furthermore, it has been shown that complementation of the pinb-D1b mutation in hard spring wheat can restore a soft phenotype. Here, the first objective was to identify and characterize the effect the puroindolines have on grain texture independently and together. The second objective was to determine which milling bread baking characteristics are affected by the seed specific over-expression of puroindolines. To accomplish both of these objectives a hard red spring wheat, possessing the pinb-D1b mutation, was transformed with 'soft type' pina and pinb, creating transgenic isolines that have added pina, pinb, or pina and pinb. Northern blot analysis of developing control and transgenic lines indicated that grain hardness differences were correlated with the timing of the expression of the native and transgenically added puroindolines. The addition of PINA decreased grain hardness less than the reduction seen with added PINB. Friabilin abundance was correlated with the presence of both 'soft type' PINA and PINB and did not correlate well with total puroindoline abundance. Selected T3 lines were grown in a field trial with two replications under dry and irrigated field conditions. Harvested grain was then milled and baked. Lines transformed with the puroindolines exhibited decreased total flour yields and increased break flour yields, yielding flour with lower protein and ash content. Decreases in loaf volume, mixograph absorption, and crumb grain scores were also observed in transgenic lines. These results demonstrate that the puroindolines can be used to profoundly influence grain hardness and a variety of milling and bread baking traits in wheat.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/hogg/HoggA04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Microscopy of Nafion&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;-117 Proton Exchange Polymer Membranes</field><field name="creator">Howe, Daniel Trusler</field><field name="description">As the combustion of fossil fuels for the generation of energy and transportation becomes more expensive, of limited supply, and environmentally unsound, the development of viable fuel cell alternatives becomes more important. A comprehensive understanding of the proton exchange membranes (PEM's) used as electrolytes in certain types of fuel cells will play a major role in bringing the cost and reliability of PEM fuel cell systems down to a competitive level with traditional fossil fuel methods. Magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) is well suited to the study of these membranes because it is non-invasive, and can spatially resolve material structure and give data on transport phenomena such as diffusion that cannot be determined by other methods. The goal of this research was to use magnetic resonance microscopy to study solvent mobility levels within the polymer membranes via spin-spin, T2, magnetic relaxation and diffusion mapping. The molecular mobility can quantify membrane swelling and spatial heterogeneity of the membrane material. A key aim of the research is to correlate these findings with previous bulk MRM studies of solvent within polymer membranes. Prior bulk MRM studies of solvent molecular mobility at different hydration levels were unable to study the membranes fully submersed in solvents, as the free solvent signal would dominate the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal from the solvent within the membrane. In this study spatial resolution of the MRM data provides the means to study fully saturated membranes, a condition of interest since the degree of hydration is related to membrane operational efficiency. The material homogeneity of the polymer in the thickness and surface directions of the membrane, an important factor in the reliable performance of fuel cells, was studied via T2 mapping. Nafion&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg;-117 was the proton exchange membrane studied because it is currently the most popular electrolyte used in the PEM fuel cell industry and several bulk MRM studies have been conducted. Results indicate that both solvent mobility and membrane swelling are highly dependant on the concentration of methanol used to prepare the samples, as seen in the bulk studies, and that solvent mobility can vary on the 20 micron level within the polymer in both the thickness and surface directions. This research establishes MRM as an important tool for the study of individual proton exchange polymer membrane samples and provides a basis for extension to the study of membranes during operation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/howe/HoweD1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Methods for Multivariate Linear Models with Spectral Models for Scatter Matrices</field><field name="creator">Hyde, Scott Kohler</field><field name="description">The main goal of this dissertation is to present extensions to the robust estimation of multivariate location and scatter.

The first is based on Maronna's M-estimators of multivariate location and scatter (Maronna 1976). The second is a multivariate extension of the S-estimators introduced by Rousseeuw and Yohai (1984). In addition, asymptotic distributions of the estimators are derived from an estimating function approach. The sandwich estimator of the asymptotic variance is given, coupled with second order corrections to the bias of the estimators. Two different data sets are used to illustrate the techniques of the dissertation. A comparison of the new algorithms to Ruppert's SURREAL algorithm is made for each example.

The study has to include what the oral tradition has meant to the indigenous people and their communities, how it has been kept and passed down, and what it can do to the tribal peoples for securing their identity and power to cope with contemporary issues. Indigenous people have different worldviews from other culture groups; theirs are different in the conception of time and space, the importance of land, of the spirit beings, and the relationships with all the beings in Nature and in the universe. This study examines how Silko weaves tradition of oral storytelling and worldviews in her writing to pass invaluable messages across the boundaries of culture. Silko has a skill and knowledge ingrained in her blood to write from her tradition, and her works are not only compatible with the worldviews of the Native Americans but also she ingeniously expresses her messages in her works, including Ceremony.

Through working as a tutor with Japanese exchange students for several years, I have found that rather than stating and continually restating the thesis throughout the course of the essay, starting away from the goal and from there slowly circling in upon it, in an elucidatory spiral, with the thesis, or center, being reached substantially for the first time only at the end, is more to my liking as a method.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/leubner/LeubnerB04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation and Testing of Resin Infusion Manufacturing Processes for Large Composite Structures</field><field name="creator">Mastbergen, Daniel Blair</field><field name="description">The use of composite materials in large primary structures such as wind turbine blades and boat hulls has dramatically increased in recent years. As these structures get larger, new manufacturing processes are required to make them possible. Larger parts also require more expensive tooling, and a higher cost for scrapped parts. This may prohibit the trial and error approach that has been used for many years. The need for accurate process modeling in the design of tooling is becoming essential. Unfortunately, as the processes become more complex so do the models. Although there are several potential processes capable of producing very large parts (10 m - 50 m), they all have one common feature. In order to alleviate the problem of forcing the resin to flow large distances though the fabric, they use a distribution system to spread the resin over the surface of the part. The resin then flows a substantially shorter distance between the channels or through the thickness. The goal of this work was to develop a modeling technique that could accurately model these processes, yet not so complex as to loose its utility. In this study, the flows through the different regions of the mold are examined individually. These regions include the injection system, the distribution channel, and the fabric. The governing equations for each region are then combined to form a comprehensive model that accounts for the flow through each region simultaneously. A series of tests were conducted to verify the models of the individual components, as well as the comprehensive model. The rate limiting step through the fabric was also examined in detail. The model correlated well with the experiments performed, and revealed critical information about these types of processes. A major conclusion is that an accurate and straightforward model can be created for large scale processes, using the small scale bench tests performed in this study. Also, the governing equations developed here from Darcy flow and Stokes flow aid in understanding how the scaling of key parameters affects the process as a whole. Variations in the geometry of the channel, the fabric thickness and fabric properties such as permeability and compressibility can be accounted for in the model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/mastbergen/MastbergenD0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Mapping Spring Wheat Using a Mobile Near-Infrared Sensor and Terrain Modeling</field><field name="creator">Meier, Corey Grant</field><field name="description">The feasibility of using a combine harvester mounted, Case New Holland ProSpectra&amp;acirc;&#8222;&amp;cent; Grain Analyzer to determine protein content of hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was tested at a level of accuracy of 0.5% protein. Should the sensor meet the target accuracy, it would be useful for on-farm segregation of wheat by protein content and for field mapping protein. Geo-referencing protein values in the field, at harvest, enables creation of protein maps to be used as surrogates for maps of soil nitrogen for directing variable rate nitrogen applications. Models were developed in the lab using partial least squares regression to relate spectra in near infrared wavelengths to grain protein, then tested on a combine harvester. The sensor did not meet the target level of accuracy in the lab and performance degraded in the field. Poor field performance was due to the presence of contaminants present in grain samples at harvest and to sensor hardware problems that yielded inconsistent results. These results suggest that the sensor is not accurate for the purpose of segregating grain, but may be accurate enough to characterize broad patterns of variability in a field to direct soil sampling efforts, if hardware problems can be fixed to replicate the best lab results in the field. An approach to characterize topographic relief in fields using LandmapR&amp;acirc;&#8222;&amp;cent; software in a geographic information system was utilized to relate hillslope position to grain protein and yield variability. A direct relationship would allow partitioning fields into management zones for directing soil sampling efforts and variable rate applications of soil nitrogen based on hillslope. A five class categorical hillslope model and wetness index explained the most variability of the models tested, explaining less than 24% variance in protein and less than 18% variance in yield. Hot conditions during grain fill were likely responsible for the low variance. Yield and protein increased downslope, most likely in response to deeper soils at downslope positions that retained moisture later in the growing season for plant uptake. Hillslope position was deemed inadequate to predict grain protein and yield, but sufficient for directing soil sampling.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/meier/MeierC04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Native Education Equity Project: Educating for the Future</field><field name="creator">Mulvaugh, Lucas Wyman</field><field name="description">From the boarding school era to the current high drop-out rates, western-based education systems have a 50% failure rate in its service to the American Indian students of Montana.

Traditional geotechnical engineering soil tests generally do not measure soil properties on a micro-scale; instead, macro scale properties are commonly used as estimates of microstructure properties in determining soil engineering behavior. Additionally, traditional geotechnical engineering soil tests are destructive in nature, and many test methods destroy the same soil properties they intend to measure. The goal of this research was to develop non-destructive soil test methods using x-ray computer-aided tomography (CT) scanning techniques to determine soil index properties. The CT scanning process provides a promising method for examining soil microstructure in a non-destructive manner. This research had two main objectives. The first was to configure the Montana State University Civil Engineering Department\'s computer-aided tomography scanner to perform CT scans on soil samples. The second objective was to use the CT scanner to develop nondestructive test procedures to determine geotechnical index properties of soils. Test methods were developed in this study to determine porosity, grain size distribution, and pore size distribution. The results from the first objective showed that the MSU CT scanning equipment is capable of producing high quality CT scans of soil materials. Resolution limitations of the scanner define the smallest soil grain size that is detectable in a CT scan, but the scan resolution may be improved by using smaller sample sizes for small particle soils. The results of the second portion of the study show that the non-destructive CT scanning test methods compare favorably with traditional geotechnical laboratory mechanical test methods. CT-measured porosity values and grain size distributions compared well with mechanical testing results, which were used to validate the new test methods. In addition, the CT-measured pore size distributions were in good agreement with an accepted pore size mathematical model. Since traditional pore size distribution tests are time-consuming, labor intensive, and destructive in nature, the non-destructive x-ray CT scanning test methods developed in this study show strong promise as a means for measuring an elusive soil property that cannot be accurately measured using traditional geotechnical testing procedures.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/nielsen/NielsenB1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Planer Probe Double Ladder Waveguide for Power Combining and Dividing</field><field name="creator">Oudrhiri, Mohammed Adil</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an initial investigation of a planar probe double ladder power combiner / divider.

The structure was developed in a manner for its eventual implementation at W-band (75.0-110.0 GHz) frequencies and above using proven micromachining techniques. A combination of analytical modeling, transmission line analysis and full wave simulations are used to design a four-way power combiner / divider for operation in R-band (1.7-2.6 GHz). The structure was realized using classical machining and exhibited a .15 dB return loss of 23% and a 0.5 dB return loss (with respect to the standard .6 dB level of a 4-way divider) of 26%. The results of this research lay the foundation for a broad-based examination of micromachined power combining / dividing structures for millimeter and submillimeter wave applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/oudrhiri/OudrhiriM04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential Semiochemicals of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Induced by Oviposition and Feeding of the Wheat Stem Sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae)</field><field name="creator">Peck, Gavin Earl</field><field name="description">Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), the wheat stem sawfly, is currently the most devastating insect pest of wheat production in Montana. Currently, no effective controls are in place to check its damage and spread throughout wheat fields in the northern Great Plains. Natural biological control of sawflies occurs primarily in the form of larval parasitoids which attack the sawfly larva in the stem; however, these parasitoids are not reliably effective in controlling sawfly populations. Insect damage induces chemical changes in plants, and often these changes are part of a defensive response to the insect injury. Some of these chemical changes are apparent in the volatile chemicals produced by the plants and may include semiochemicals used by sawflies and parasitoids. Identifying the changes in volatile production could enhance the understanding of sawfly-wheat plant-parasitoid interactions and lead to more effective control measures for the wheat stem sawfly. I investigated the differences in the volatile chemicals produced by sawfly-infested and uninfested wheat plants and endeavored to determine if those differences were qualitative or quantitative. Additionally, I wanted to determine if changes in volatile production induced by the wheat stem sawfly could be mimicked by wounding coupled with the application of sawfly cuticular wax to wheat stems or by the injection of frass-treated water into the internodes of wheat stems. Volatiles of infested and uninfested wheat plants were collected and compared, with the results indicating that sawfly damage induces quantitative changes in some volatile chemicals produced by wheat. These results are discussed regarding their context within sawfly-wheat plant-parasitoid interactions and implications for better sawfly control. Volatiles from sawfly-infested, uninfested, frass-water-injected, and pin-pricked/waxtreated plants were also collected, and differences in 11 compounds selected from the results of the 1st experiment were compared. The results of this experiment found that pin-pricked/wax-treated plants came closer to mimicking the volatile production changes induced by sawfly infestation, but neither frass-water injection nor pin-pricked/cuticular wax application reliably induced the same changes in wheat volatiles that sawfly infestation did. There was, however, a definite response of the wheat to the application of the sawfly cuticular wax, and its significance is discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/peck/PeckG1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Cognition among Montana Eleventh and Twelfth Grade Agricultural Education Students</field><field name="creator">Price, Danielle Nicole</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to determine high school student's spatial cognition abilities to identify features and attributes in agriculture production images, projected in two-dimension (2D) or three-dimension (3D).

The population consisted of 101 high school students from selected secondary agricultural education programs during the Fall Semester of 2003. Criteria for participation were that the class size be 10-15 students enrolled in 11th or 12th grade. The agricultural classes were randomly assigned as either participating in the 2D or 3D study. When viewing 2D and 3D images of production agriculture students were able to correctly identify features and attributes about 50 percent of the time. Based on the 17 multiple-choice questions of the 23 questions used, there was no significant difference in students' spatial cognitive abilities when viewing 2D and 3D production agriculture images. When viewing production agriculture images in 3D, containing features and attributes relative to elevation, spatial cognition was enhanced.

Biofilm structural development is a dynamic process dependent on many cellular and environmental parameters including Quorum Sensing (QS) and hydrodynamics. Since QS is dependent on a threshold autoinducer concentration, it was hypothesized that the flow dynamics in the bulk fluid surrounding the biofilm would play an important role in expression of QS and the genes that are under its control. In order to investigate the relative contribution of hydrodynamics and QS on biofilm development, biofilms were grown from wild type Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and the cell signaling lasI mutant PAO1-JP1 under laminar and turbulent flows. When morphology of the biofilms were quantified using Image Structure Analyzer (ISA) software, a multivariate analysis demonstrated that both QS and hydrodynamics influenced biofilm structure, suggesting that QS was not required for biofilm development but affected structural heterogeneity in biofilms. GFP reporter based gene expression analysis of QS regulated lasB (coding for elastase) expression during biofilm development in laminar flow further supported these results. Detachment has been recognized as another factor that may define structural morphology of biofilms. Under flow conditions hollow biofilm clusters were formed as a result of active detachment process, termed as "seeding dispersal". A differentiation of a "seeding" microcolony into an interior motile, swarming, phenotype and a non-motile surrounding, "wall phenotype" formed as a prelude to the dispersal process in which the interior cells swarmed out of the microcolony from local break out points and spread over the wall of the flow cell. A critical microcolony diameter of approximately 100 um was required for differentiation suggesting that regulation was related to cell density and mass transfer conditions. It was found that rhamnolipid (rhlA-) biosurfactant was not required and QS system (PAO1-JP2) was shown to be important in this process, possibly by sensing nutrient limitation within the biofilm microcolonies. These results strengthen a current view of multi-cellularity and coordinated behavior in prokaryotes as well as a dynamic network of overlapping pathways and cellular mechanisms that act on biofilm development in a complex interrelated manner.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/purevdorj-gage/Purevdorj-GageB1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rationalism and D.

Logos or \"the word\" has generally been privileged over mythos or pathos, denoting emotion and feeling. This privileging has sometimes been challenged by intellectuals within the Western tradition. D. H. Lawrence was the most vocal and passionate writer to do so in modern times. This text traces the development of rationalism in the Western tradition and Lawrence\'s resistance to it. It also examines modern theoretical developments and notes their convergence with Lawrence\'s ideas. It concludes by claiming that the postmodern intellectual climate in the West tends towards a critique of rationalism, much like Lawrence.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/rehan/RehanN04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil Water Use and Root System Characteristics of C. maculosa and Sympatric Plants</field><field name="creator">Swan, Megan Cashman</field><field name="description">Centaurea maculosa Lam. (spotted knapweed) is an introduced perennial forb that invades disturbed and undisturbed semiarid grasslands in the western United States. It forms dense monocultures and reduces native and desirable vegetation. We hypothesized that C. maculosa may succeed through a superior ability to access soil water. This study had two objectives, to compare soil water uptake patterns under C. maculosa, perennial grass, and R. hirta monocultures in the field on semiarid rangeland, and to compare root characteristics of C. maculosa and R. hirta plants grown under two soil water regimes in the greenhouse. For the first objective, we used two field sites in western Montana. We created four blocks of adjacent monoculture plots of three species (perennial grasses, C. maculosa and R. hirta) arranged in a randomized complete block design. Soil water dynamics were monitored throughout the growing season at six hour intervals in the upper 0.3 m of the soil profile using TDR, and weekly to biweekly at greater depths using a neutron moisture meter. Centaurea maculosa used more water than resident grasses when averaged over the soil profile and had greater water use than grass at greater depths later in the growing season. R. hirta displayed similar soil water uptake to C. maculosa in the second year of our study. There was no \"carry-over effect\" of low soil water contents at deep soil depths from the end of the first growing season to the beginning of the next. To address our second objective, we grew 10 individuals of C. maculosa and R. hirta under either \"dry\" or \"wet\" soil water conditions for 3 months in the greenhouse, then extracted, cleaned, stained and scanned their roots to quantify several root characteristics. Centaurea maculosa had lower root mass, root length, specific length, root length density and greater average root diameter than R. hirta under both soil water regimes. Centaurea maculosa had higher root mass ratios than R. hirta, but this may have been due to phenological differences at time of harvest or differences in nitrogen utilization. Our results suggest that C. maculosa may invade and persist in western rangelands due to its ability to take up soil water unavailable to native grasses which allows it to continue growth and photosynthesis late in the growing season. However, similar water uptake patterns and greater total root system size and efficiency of the non-invasive R. hirta indicate that C. maculosa does not have unique characteristics indicating superior belowground competitive ability, but may in fact share traits common to other late season tap-rooted forb species.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/swan/SwanM0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mixed Messages: Thomas Calloway and the 'American Negro Exhibit' of 1900</field><field name="creator">Travis, Miles Everett</field><field name="description">In the last decade of the nineteenth century, African Americans faced growing hostility and disenfranchisement from the white majority, especially in the former Confederate states. African Americans were divided over the best strategy for dealing with their deteriorating circumstance, and after the death of Frederick Douglass in 1895, they lacked an established leader that could give voice to their concerns. To many, their best hope laid in the leadership and philosophy of an Alabama educator named Booker T. Washington. Washington taught that African Americans should not clamor for immediate recognition and equality, but instead work hard to become financially independent and important. He believed that once blacks earned and possessed what whites wanted, material wealth, then they would be accepted readily into American society. However, a significant group of blacks opposed Washington's teachings, asking how African Americans could prosper without the social and political means to promote their interests and ensure their safety and wellbeing. Although this alternative faction began to emerge more fully after the 1903 publication of W. E. B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk, which contained a harsh critique of Washington, the tension between these two philosophies was captured earlier in the materials of the "American Negro Exhibit," a display at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900. The exhibit was coordinated and compiled by Thomas Calloway. Calloway, an African American colleague of both Washington and Du Bois, hoped to integrate their strategies and show Europeans the true nature of the African American community. The materials he collected, as well as his arrangement of them, act as a record of the conflicting ideas embraced by the African American community at the turn of the century and as a testament to the debate over which images would have priority in defining African American racial identity and strategy. The collection was a huge success in the eyes of Europeans who visited the fair, but did little to impact the racial discourse in the United States when the display returned and went on view at two American fairs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/travis/TravisM04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Gut Analysis of Carabids (Coleoptera: carabidae) using Aphid Primers</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Sarah Kate</field><field name="description">Carabid beetles are found in a variety of Montana crops, although their impact on the food web is poorly known.

Further, there were differences among genera in the proportion of fed beetles positive for aphid DNA at the tested digestion intervals. Field surveys of 273 individual carabid beetle gut contents, representing seven genera, found all genera surveyed in Montana cropping systems, except Microlestes and Pasymachus, positive for aphid DNA.

The range of application can be vastly expanded when attached with a heterogeneous mix of functionalities tailored to meet a specific need. The effective application requires the acquisition of several new techniques. First, chemical control of the average ratio of functional groups and analytical methods to determine the ratio. Secondly, a determination of the distribution of ratios. And finally, a method whereby the spatial distribution is determined. The ratio and distribution of ratios were determined by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry. The average ratio was easily controlled by using stoichiometric ratios of reactants and the distribution of ratios was found to follow a normal distribution. This was determined by the analysis of the MALDI spectral linewidths. The spatial distribution was determined by a Spin-Label Electron Paramagnetic Resonance technique. By adapting and combining mathematical and spectroscopic techniques from other related systems, it was found that the EPR spectrum was sensitive to the spatial distribution of spin-labels included as one of the attached functional groups. The dipolar interaction between spins lead to an increase in spectral line-broadening that could be compared to computer simulations of different spatial distributions. For all cases studied the distribution was found to be random.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/walter/WalterE04.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote Sensing of Wetlands in Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Wright, Christopher Kevin</field><field name="description">As part of the Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative, satellite remote sensing was used to identify potential wetland amphibian habitat in Yellowstone National Park. Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery was combined with ancillary predictors of wetland occurrence including habitat type, cover type, landform type, bedrock geology, soil attributes, terrain measures, and climate data. Classification trees were used to predict the likelihood of palustrine wetland occurrence across the Yellowstone landscape. Wetland maps generated by this study are intended to address shortcomings of the National Wetland Inventory in Yellowstone; namely, errors-of-omission and the temporally invariant nature of the inventory. Relative importance of Thematic Mapper imagery, image texture information, terrain measures, and thematic spatial data were assessed by comparing the accuracy of classification trees trained with different subsets of predictors. In general, classification trees using all available predictors exhibited the greatest accuracy. Classification tree structure was similar in models generated with satellite imagery from different years. Also, similar accuracy rates were found across years. The results indicate that the method could be applied to annual wetland monitoring. Average producer's accuracy for the palustrine wetland class was approximately 0.92. Five palustrine wetland classes were discriminated with an average overall accuracy of approximately 0.83. A wetland map derived from a 1 August, 2003 Thematic Mapper image was field-verified in late-summer and early-autumn of 2003. The classification tree methodology appears to be sensitive to within-season wetland condition and yearly wetland variability. Satellite remote sensing located wetlands not mapped by the National Wetland Inventory and also identified upland sites erroneously classified as wetland. Methods developed by this study are general enough to be applied in other physiographic settings and should prove to be useful to amphibian conservation efforts over large geographic extents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/wright/WrightC1204.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Growth Patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms</field><field name="creator">Xu, Ruifang</field><field name="description">Biofilms are less susceptible to antimicrobial action compared to their planktonic counterparts. The protective mechanisms are not fully understood. Physiological heterogeneity within biofilms is thought to contribute to the low susceptibility and was therefore studied. Expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP), induction of alkaline phosphatase (APase) by phosphate starvation, and the cell viability assay using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability stain were performed to visualize the spatial patterns of growth and viability within 5-d-old Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The capillary reactor and the drip-flow reactor were employed to obtain biofilms of a range of thickness. Biofilms cultivated in the capillary reactor were usually thinner than those grown in the low-shear drip-flow reactor. The former were examined by in situ confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) whereas the latter were cryoembedded and cryosectioned prior to conventional fluorescence microscopic observation. P. aeruginosa PAO1 with the plasmid pAB1 carrying an inducible, stable gfp was used to identify zones of active protein synthesis. The induction of gfp proved suitable for the visualization of spatial growth patterns within biofilms. Greater GFP activity was evident at the surface of clusters and was not as bright in their centers after induction. Activity appeared more uniform in smaller clusters and less uniform in larger clusters. The APase activity induced by phosphate starvation showed a sharply delineated band of active APase synthesizing cells close to the biofilm-bulk fluid interface and some local APase synthetic activity in the depth of the biofilm. The results of biofilm viability staining using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit turned out to be puzzling and cast doubt on the methodological validity of applying the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability staining method to P. aeruginosa biofilms. The findings of the spatial growth patterns illustrate the physiological heterogeneity that is present in these biofilms. Such variation in the metabolic activity probably contributes to the reduced susceptibility of these biofilms to antimicrobial agents.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/xu/XuR0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pleasure Ground for the Future: The Evolving Cultural Landscape of Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park 1870-1966</field><field name="creator">Youngs, Yolonda Lucille</field><field name="description">Yellowstone Lake is located in the protected federal lands of Yellowstone National Park. This park is situated in the Rocky Mountains and its boundaries reach into the tri-state areas of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. While many researchers have investigated the history and geography of Yellowstone National Park, Yellowstone Lake has been largely ignored as a topic of research. In order to reconstruct the evolution of Yellowstone Lake as a cultural landscape, this study focuses on Yellowstone Lake temporally and spatially as an important and central area of Yellowstone National Park. This study suggests that Yellowstone Lake's large and diverse physical geography produces diverse natural environments, cultural landscapes, and national park experiences. The results of this study show that through a combination of concessionaire investment, government management, and visitor demand, the cultural landscape of Yellowstone Lake has changed dramatically over time. This change is depicted through a verbal and cartographic description of Yellowstone Lake's cultural landscape evolution from 1870 to 1966. The verbal description is accompanied by a series of maps reflecting significant changes in the lake's cultural landscape. This research also provides a useful template and methodology for other historical geographers researching national park cultural landscapes. The archival research component to this project involved gathering data from Yellowstone National Park superintendent reports, development files, concessionaire files, historic maps, guidebooks, correspondence, and historic photography. By developing a set of methods that used a combination of data sources (aerial photographs, historic maps, guidebook descriptions, historic photographs, and field-based observations), conflicting and sometimes inconsistent written archival records could be reconciled and an accurate description of the lake emerged. This study raises questions about the role Yellowstone Lake plays in the larger identity of Yellowstone National Park. The results of this study will be useful for future national park management and development professionals. A better understanding of Yellowstone Lake's historic cultural landscapes will aid these professionals in making decisions about cultural resource preservation, recreation, and historic preservation. In addition, this study may help national park managers and concessionaires to develop better cultural landscape interpretation for Yellowstone National Park and Yellowstone Lake.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2004/youngs/YoungsY0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inter-Dimension</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Michael</field><field name="description">My current body of work began just over three years ago based upon an obscure passage in a book by Ann Rice that described Archangels as being created before the universe was created, thus not being made of matter.

This study measured the EI of 15 principals willing to participate from randomly selected school districts in Wyoming, using the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso EI Test (MSCEIT), which measures four categories of EI: (1) Managing Emotions, assessed using the Emotional Management task and the Social Management task, (2) Understanding Emotions, assessed using the Blends task and the Changes task, (3) Using Emotions, assessed using the Sensations task and the Facilitation task, and (4) Perceiving Emotions, assessed using the Faces task and the Pictures task. All teachers from the participating schools were questioned using the David C. Anchin School Culture Quality Survey. This survey measures teachers\' perceptions of (1) Having a shared vision, (2) Facilitative leadership, (3) Teamwork and cooperation of staff, and (4) Nurturing a learning community. This instrument is designed specifically to measure the work culture of teachers, which enables them to do their job well. Data analysis included a hierarchical linear model of the current status of teachers\'s perceptions of the school culture\'s four categories (shared vision, facilitative leadership, teamwork and cooperation, and nurturing a learning community) and the current status of the four categories of emotional intelligence of the principal (managing emotions, using emotions, understanding emotions, and perceiving emotions).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/barent/BarentJ0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semantic Activation Without Awareness: Still No Reliable Evidence</field><field name="creator">Bengson, Jesse Jon</field><field name="description">Three experiments were conducted to examine whether semantic association contributes to unconscious priming. Experiment 1 used exclusion instructions in which participants were told to avoid completing the stem (e.g. mo---) with a word related to a masked prime (e.g. cash) flashed for 0, 38, or 212 ms. Significant semantic priming was found only in the items analysis when data was averaged across participants. In the subjects analysis, this performance was moderated by participants' ability to report the prime. Experiment 2 used a free association task to examine unconscious semantic priming. Participants were instructed to respond to a target homograph (e.g. pupil) with the first word that came to mind that is not related to the meaning of the flashed word (e.g. student). No significant unconscious semantic priming was found. Experiment 3 replicated the conditions previously used to demonstrate unconscious semantic priming and show that such priming is due to methodological problems. The same methodology as Experiment 2 was used except participants were given inclusion instead of exclusion instructions. Significant priming was found across all trials; however, this priming dissolved when only the trials where participants failed to report the prime were examined. The results of all experiments suggest that unconscious semantic priming from word stimuli is a result of residual conscious awareness of the prime.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/bengson/BengsonJ0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the Recruited Neutrophil in the Innate Response to Aspergillus fumigatus</field><field name="creator">Bonnett, Colin Russell</field><field name="description">Strong clinical and experimental evidence links qualitative and quantitative neutrophil deficiencies to fatal infections caused by A. fumigatus. Yet the role of the neutrophil in mediating the protection observed in normal hosts remains largely unknown. Recent studies indicate neutrophils from CXCR2-/- mice are unable to migrate toward chemokine gradients of KC and MIP-2, rendering these animals susceptible to fatal aspergillosis. Mice with a mutation in the gene encoding for the gp91phox component of the NADPH oxidase lack the ability to generate the reactive oxygen metabolites used by phagocytes in killing microbial pathogens, and these mice are also susceptible to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In this investigation of the innate response to A. fumigatus, CXCR2-/- and gp91-/- mice were used to mimic the qualitative and quantitative neutrophil defects that are known to predispose to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, the most lethal form of Aspergillus diseases. By comparing the nature of the predisposition of these mice with the robust immunity observed in normal and immunocompetent mice, insight was gained on the involvement of this key phagocyte in the innate response. Several important parameters of the innate response in the lung were analyzed in this investigation, including (1) leukocyte recruitment and organism engagement, (2) organism killing mechanisms, (3) cytokine levels of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and (4) in vitro organism killing by leukocytes. Following intratracheal challenge of A. fumigatus conidia a delay of 3 hours in neutrophil recruitment to lungs of CXCR2-/- animals was observed, allowing significant conidial germination and hyphal formation not seen in normal animals. In contrast, the gp91phox-/- mice recruited neutrophils normally but failed to inhibit conidial germination and hyphal proliferation, apparently as a result of their inability to generate the appropriate conidiacidal mediators. In normal mice inoculated conidia were rapidly sequestered within neutrophil aggregates involving a response by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase detected by formazan deposition. These results suggest a previously undescribed role for neutrophils that conduct early inflammatory events following exposure to A. fumigatus conidia, involving first sequestration of ungerminated conidia within neutrophil complexes, and subsequently oxidant generation that prevents hyphal outgrowth.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/bonnett/BonnettC0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mythologizing the History of Easter Island through Documentary Films</field><field name="creator">Boyd, Laura Jean</field><field name="description">Documentaries have the power to rewrite history and perpetuate myths in our society. In the case of Easter Island, documentary filmmakers have sensationalized the history of the Rapa Nui people, dwelling on dramatic concepts such as eco-disaster, cannibalism and mysteriously vanishing cultures. As a result of poor filmmaking, we have a mythologized history of Easter Island. In my attempt to create a science-based documentary about an issue affecting contemporary Easter Island society, this mythologizing of history became a major obstacle. It became apparent that I had to first inform audiences to the fact that they had been misinformed by previous documentaries about Easter Island and I had to change their interpretation of the alleged facts. In my thesis paper I examine the documentaries that created sensational statements about the island and reveal why documentary filmmakers rely on dramatic elements. I also examine my approach to the process of making my graduate thesis film, Caballo Loco on Easter Island, and review the methods I used to ensure the people of Rapa Nui were accurately represented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/boyd/BoydL1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Montana State 4-H Volunteer Leader College: Does it Make a Difference?</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Ricarda Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to measure the degree to which leaders who received training through the Montana 4-H Volunteer Leader College (VLC) had an affect on the life skills development of members in their 4-H clubs. Data was collected using a written survey. Leaders and members from 4-H clubs in Montana comprised the sample. Descriptive statistics, two-tailed t-tests, and chisquare were generated for analysis. After analysis, the following conclusions, recommendations and implications were made: Conclusions: (1) 4-H members surveyed were demographically similar. Leaders in the treatment group had been involved more years as 4-H leaders. Leaders from the treatment group reported receiving higher levels of training from 4-H extension. (2) Members's perceptions of their life skills or leaders's perceptions of their ability to provide members with life skills were not influenced by training through the VLC. (3) A greater occurrence of officer training and a difference in officer selection was reported by members of the treatment group. (4) Community involvement, as summarized by leaders, seemed to be more varied and occurred more often in the treatment group. Higher levels in this area were also perceived by members in the treatment group. Recommendations: (1) Further study was recommended to determine if mandatory training of volunteer leaders for life skills development provided different impacts than volunteer training, Additionally, further research was needed to determine the effect officer election and training strategies employed by leaders had on level of community involvement of clubs. (3) Assessment of the VLC was recommended, with consideration given to the National 4-H Strategic Plan. (4) A quasi-experimental design using larger treatment and control groups from throughout Montana should be conducted. (5) Changes to the survey instrument should be included in further research. Implications: (1) Overall, the perceived life skills possessed by Montana State 4-H members were high, regardless of leader training. (2) Alternative explanations were available concerning specific leader practices of officer training and selection and community involvement.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/bradbury/BradburyR0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil Water Flow and Irrigated Soil Water Balance in Response to Powder River Basin Coalbed Methane Product Water</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Margaret MacNeill</field><field name="description">A repacked soil columns experiment and a series of computer soil water balance simulations were conducted to examine potential impacts of coalbed methane (CBM) water from Montana's Powder River Basin (PRB) on soil water flow and water balance in PRB soils. CBM water is often high in sodium, which may separate soil clay particles, particularly after soil exposure to low-salinity rainfall or snowmelt, and when soils contain expansible smectite clay minerals. Aggregates in soils exposed to sodic water may swell and slake, and clays and other fine particles may disperse, clogging soil pores and slowing or preventing soil water flow. In the soil columns experiment, A and B horizon materials from sandy loam, silt loam, and clay loam soils were pre-treated with water having salinity and sodicity typical of PRB CBM water or of Powder River (PR) water currently used for irrigation in the basin. Tension infiltrometer measurements were used to determine infiltration flux, first using pre-treatment water, and subsequently deionized (DI) water, simulating rainwater. Measurements were compared by pre-treatment water, horizon, and soil type. Under pre-treatment water testing, the sandy loam and clay loam soils pre-treated with CBM water exhibited smaller infiltration flux values than when pre-treated with PR water. Only the sandy loam soil showed a greater decrease in infiltration flux with DI water on soils pre-treated with CBM relative to PR water pre-treated soils. There was no difference in infiltration flux decrease with DI water between A and B horizon soils, or between smectite and non-smectite soils. The soil water balance numerical simulations modeled potential effects of sodic irrigation waters on sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and silty clay PRB soils under sprinkler or flood irrigation, during one growing season. Baseline soil water retention functions were constructed for the five soils, and adjusted via trends identified in the literature to create five additional functions for each soil, simulating exposure to five increasingly sodic irrigation waters. Simulation results showed greater impact of sodic irrigation under flood than sprinkler irrigation. The fine sandy loam and silty clay loam soils exhibited the fewest changes in water balance partitioning, while the silt loam and silty clay soils showed the greatest changes, especially in increased runoff and reduced transpiration.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/buchanan/BuchananM0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Solar Extreme Ultra-Violet Corona: Resolved Loops and the Unresolved Active Region Corona</field><field name="creator">Cirtain, Jonathan Wesley</field><field name="description">In this work, physical characteristics of the solar corona as observed in the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) regime are investigated. The focus will be the regions of intense EUV radiation generally found near the locations of sunspots. These regions are commonly called active regions. Multiple space-based observing platforms have been deployed in the last decade; it is possible to use several of these observatories in combination to develop a more complete picture of the solar corona. Joint Observing Program 146 was created to collect spectroscopic intensities using the Coronal Diagnostic Spectrometer on Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and EUV images using NASA's Transition Region and Coronal Explorer. The emission line intensities are analyzed to develop an understanding of the temperature and density of the active region coronal plasma. However, the performance of the CDS instrument in the spatial and temporal domains is limited and to compensate for these limitations, data collected by the TRACE instrument provide a high spatial and temporal resolution set of observations. One of the most exciting unsolved problems in solar astrophysics is to understand why the corona maintains a temperature roughly two orders of magnitude higher than the underlying material. A detailed investigation of the coronal emission has provided constraints on models of the heating mechanism, since the temperature density and evolution of emission rates for multiple ionic species are indicative of the mechanism(s) working to heat the corona. The corona appears to consist of multiple unresolved structures as well as resolved active region structures, called coronal loops. The purpose of the present work is to determine the characteristics of the unresolved background corona. Using the characterizations of the coronal unresolved background, results for loops after background subtraction are also presented. This work demonstrates the magnitude of the unresolved coronal emission with respect to the total emission along the line of sight, and the relationship of the coronal background emission to the resolved loop emission. It is apparent from this analysis that the unresolved corona is the dominant source of radiation in active regions. Additionally, the unresolved active region coronal emission can be characterized by hydrostatic scaling laws.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/cirtain/CirtainJ0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microwave Planer-Probe Traveling-Wave Power Dividing-Combining</field><field name="creator">Dickman, Edward John</field><field name="description">TAs the millimeterwave and sub-millimeterwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum are increasingly utilized, the need for greater power at those frequencies also increases. Unfortunately, as frequency is increased, the power available from a single solid-state device decreases. Thus, in many applications, the combining of power from several solid-state devices becomes necessary to have usable signal power levels. This thesis presents two such power combining approaches, whose designs are compatible with existing microfabrication techniques that may be used to produce devices operating at 300 GHz and beyond. Additionally, this thesis describes a mathematical modeling procedure that incorporates signal flow and transmission line concepts, and aids in the efficient design of one of these topologies, the Planar-Probe Traveling-Wave Divider- Combiner. Such a modeling approach could be readily applied to traveling wave structures of different topologies. The complete design, simulation, and experimental validation of a conventionally-machined two-way traveling-wave dividing-combining module is demonstrated at X-band frequencies. The demonstrated 15 dB return loss fractional bandwidth was almost 21%, and the insertion loss was found to be better than 0.5 dB throughout most of the operational band. The promising performance of this structure shows that further investigation is merited.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/dickman/DickmanE1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Dynamics of Centaurea maculosa and Native Species</field><field name="creator">D\'Imperio, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">Centaurea maculosa has invaded millions of hectares of disturbed and undisturbed semi-arid grasslands. Its success may be due to an ability to conserve nitrogen (N) or use N more efficiently than native species. It may also be able to acquire more N from early spring pulses than native vegetation. Growth response, N acquisition, allocation, resorption and use efficiency of C. maculosa was compared with Pseudoroegneria spicata, Pascopyrum smithii, and Rudbeckia hirta by growing plants in high and low N supplies, which mimic disturbed and undisturbed sites. 15Nitrogen acquired per unit of root mass was highest in R. hirta. Centaurea maculosa had the lowest C:N ratio. Resorption proficiency was lower in C. maculosa for Harvest 2 and 3, and similar among all species at Harvest 4. Centaurea maculosa had the highest mean residence time (MRT) and lowest N productivity. Centaurea maculosa had the highest nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for plants receiving the high N supply whereas NUE was similar for all species receiving the low N supply. Centaurea maculosa\'s success in disturbed sites may be due to a high NUE, which can be attributed to a high MRT. Uptake and growth response of C. maculosa receiving an early spring, late spring or steady N treatment were determined in a glasshouse and a field study. Centaurea maculosa\'s response was compared with P. spicata, Festuca idahoensis and R. hirta in the glasshouse, and P. spicata, F. idahoensis and Balsamorhiza sagittata in the field. In the glasshouse, with plants receiving the steady N treatment produced the most biomass whereas plants receiving the late N treatment produced the least. Grasses receiving the early N treatment had the highest root mass ratio (RMR), whereas RMRs of C. maculosa were similar among N treatments. Forbs acquired more N than grasses. In the field, biomass was similar among N treatments. Plants took up more N from the early treatments than the late or steady treatments. Centaurea maculosa may be able to acquire more N from pulses than grasses in disturbed sites when plants are small, but as the grasses grow, C. maculosa may lose its advantage in acquiring N.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/dimperio/D'ImperioE0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Riparian Vegetation of the Montana Yellowstone and Cattle Grazing Impacts Thereon</field><field name="creator">Eggers, Margaret Joy Slack</field><field name="description">The objects of my research were two. To describe ungrazed vegetation of thirty sites well dispersed along the 500 mile length of the Yellowstone River. And to measure the effects of gazing on this vegetation by describing/comparing vegetation of these ungrazed control sites with the vegetation of nearby grazed sites. Vegetation of the Yellowstone consists of three lateral bands on open shore (gravel or sandbar), willow thicket, and cottonwood forest. Their appearance on successively older deposits suggests control both by decreasing water availability (greater depth to water on inland sites with overdeposits) and increasing age (overtopping, first by willow and then by cottonwood, and accumulation of shrubs). The primary longitudinal (downstream) change between foothill and plains sites, probably driven by decreasing rainfall, was the change of forest dominant from P. angustifolia to P. deltoides. The apparent failure of P. deltoides reproduction could eventually eliminate the forest zone. Grazing affects all of the five communities identified. With grazing, overall cover decreased in every vegetation type, with the greatest losses in sandbars, willow thickets and P angustifolia forests. Cottonwood seedlings were grazed on bars and in willow thickets. Cover of hydric (Salix spp., Cornus, Ribes spp.) and mesic (Symphoricarpos) native shrubs was significantly reduced. Rosa spp. lost cover with trampling. Invasive shrubs Russian olive and tamarisk, downstream, are apparently unaffected by grazing, except indirectly as grazing reduces their competition. Forb cover was most affected in Populus forests, with natives declining and non-natives increasing with grazing. Non-native grasses, the dominant herbs in cottonwoods, become more dominant with grazing. Observation of the exotics present emphasized the equal or greater impact of their invasion. Cover of exotics rises laterally from shore (50% with equal grass/forb composition) through willow thicket (70%, mostly exotic grass) to cottonwood forest (76-78%). The diversity of exotic herbs increases (laterally and downstream.). In the shrub layer Russian olive and tamarisk, pests in the American Southwest, increased greatly in the Plains in the 1980-2000 period and have a potential to dominate the forest and willow zones respectively. The ecosystem impacts of exotic increase will likely modify aesthetics, wildlife, and ranching drastically.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/eggers/EggersM1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy in Complex Sample Geometry</field><field name="creator">Fig, Matthew Kenneth</field><field name="description">Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) is the study of the mechanical resonances, or normal modes, of elastic bodies to infer material properties such as the elasticity matrix. This powerful technique is based on two physical facts, the first of which is that the resonant response of an elastic object depends on several parameters intrinsic to the object, such as the object's shape, density, elastic constants, and crystallographic orientation. The second is that using these parameters, the resonant spectrum of an object can be calculated. This method has widely been applied to rectangular parallelepipeds (RPPDs) because the use of such simple geometry frees an investigator interested only in acquiring the elastic constants of a particular material from the hindrance of dealing with the additional computational difficulty imposed by more complex sample geometry. In addition to the use of RPPDs, some work has been done with other objects of high symmetry such as cylinders and spheres. The goal of this research was to explore the extension of RUS techniques to objects exhibiting more complex shape. Toward this end, a computational method was developed for handling the addition of complex geometry. This computational scheme was then verified experimentally through the examination of several objects exhibiting complex shapes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/fig/FigM1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relativistic Accretion Flows onto Supermassive Black Holes: Shock Formation and Iron Fluorescent Emission Lines in Active Galactic Nuclei</field><field name="creator">Fukumura, Keigo</field><field name="description">One of the exciting discoveries from the recent X-ray spectroscopic studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is the so called "relativistically-broadened iron fluorescent emission line" often detected in the hard X-ray spectra. It is generally believed to originate from the inner part of the accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole (BH) at the center. Although we have begun to obtain some physical insight regarding such emission lines supported by theoretical models (e.g., disk-corona model), exactly how and where the observed fluorescence may take place is still disputable. Here, an X-ray data with XMM-Newton Observatory of a typical narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, NGC 4051, is analyzed based on a partial covering model to consistently explain the observed time-resolved temporal/spectral variations. This model implies that the intrinsic emission varies significantly in the presence of the covering cloud. We often detect a hard X-ray continuum originating from a hot region close to the central engines of AGNs. As a promising X-ray source candidate, relativistic hydrodynamic (HD) shocks are investigated systematically and then extended to the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks, given the widely accepted suggestion that the presence of the magnetic fields could play an important role in the accreting flows. I show that both HD and MHD shocks can form in the vicinity of the BH, perhaps responsible for creating such a high temperature region where hard X-rays are produced. Particularly in the MHD shocked plasma, the hydro/magneto-dominated states are found. Considering the effect of such magnetic fields in the accretion disk, I calculate nonstandard iron fluorescent line profiles in the presence of spiral density waves and find multiple sharp sub-peak structures in extremely skewed line profiles, which will be detectable with upcoming X-ray satellites such as Astro-E2 XRS for testing the model.

Business plans are vital if a business is to have a chance to succeed. Many talents of the advanced nurse practitioner are transferable to the development of a business plan. Assessing, identifying problems (diagnosing), developing interventions, implementing solutions, and evaluating activities are equally important to the business plan and to the clinical practice of the nurse practitioner. This project addresses the problem of how nurse practitioners can use their talent to develop a business plan that is sound and can be implemented. The completed project identifies the components of a business plan in business terms and in health care terms. It includes discussions of the relevant components of a business plan that include: an executive summary, the vision and mission statement, a business strategy and strength, weakness, opportunities, and threat analysis (SWOT), an industry analysis, market strategy and plan, operational plan, and a financial plan that includes a projected cash flow for the development of a privately owned, entrepreneurial, family nurse practitioner practice. Included in this project is a specific business model for a practice in rural Northeast Iowa. The entrepreneur nurse practitioner will be able to use this business plan as a model to personalize a business plan, to seek funding, or to actually implement a private nursing practice. Throughout the completion of this project, it was realized that no one plan can solve every problem that may arise. A good plan can determine if a business practice is feasible, provide warning signs for when it is time to reexamine the idea of establishing a private practice and guide contingency plans for unpredicted events in the life of a business.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/harris/HarrisS1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nursing Faculty Attitudes, Knowledge and Practice of Therapeutic Touch</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Lynn Janine</field><field name="description">Therapeutic touch is increasingly recognized as a nursing intervention that complements traditional medical care. Few studies specifically address nursing faculty perspectives on therapeutic touch and whether faculty include therapeutic touch theory or skills content in courses they teach. The purpose of this study was to describe nursing faculty attitudes, knowledge and practice of therapeutic touch. In addition, barriers to practicing or teaching therapeutic touch were identified. A survey (n=23) of nursing faculty teaching undergraduate students was conducted in a university-based nursing program. Faculty were in agreement about incorporating content on the theory of therapeutic touch into nursing curricula. Over 85% of faculty thought that patients could benefit from therapeutic touch and that therapeutic touch holds promise for treatment of disease. Nearly 74% of faculty thought that clinical nursing care should integrate the use of therapeutic touch. Few (30%) had received formal therapeutic touch education. Over half (56.5%) desired more education about therapeutic touch but primarily for the purposes of personal knowledge and teaching nursing students rather than for practicing therapeutic touch. The primary barrier to using therapeutic touch in practice was identified as lack of staff training. The most important perceived barrier to incorporating therapeutic touch practice into nursing curricula was lack of faculty training. Current faculty knowledge of therapeutic touch, in this sample, lingers behind interest, suggesting an environment ready for change. Identifying faculty attitudes, knowledge and practice of therapeutic touch could have an impact on inclusion of therapeutic touch in future nursing curricula. Understanding faculty desire for therapeutic touch education could help in faculty development critical to integrating therapeutic touch in curricula and practice. A nursing college that incorporates therapeutic touch demonstrates commitment to a holistic nursing environment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/hughes/HughesL0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Placebo</field><field name="creator">Hunter, William Hawkins</field><field name="description">I view my thesis show as an opportunity to present a body of work unified by process, ideas and context.

L) Polyphenol Oxidases (PPOs)</field><field name="creator">Jukanti, Aravind Kumar</field><field name="description">Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) from several plant species, including wheat, have been implicated in the undesirable brown discoloration of food products. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) represents an interesting system to advance our understanding of plant PPO function for two important reasons, namely (1) the large size an complexity of its (allohexaploid) genome, and (2) its economic importance. Prior to this study, the molecular and biochemical properties of wheat PPOs were largely unknown. To remedy this situation, we have performed several BLAST searches of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases, using a known wheat PPO sequence as a search tool. This study suggested the presence of at least six PPO genes in hexaploid wheat, falling into two different phylogenetic clusters of three genes each. Presence of a wheat PPO multigene family was confirmed by Southern blotting. A combination of biochemical (enzyme purification and mass spectrometric analysis) and molecular (Northern) approaches confirmed that members of one cluster are not expressed in the developing kernels and senescing flag leaves, while regulation of one or several members of the other gene cluster controls PPO activity in these tissues. Our data, including immunoblotting and enzyme activity studies, further indicated that wheat PPOs are synthesized as inactive precursor (early kernel development) which are proteolytically processed and activated as the kernels mature. Activation of PPO precursor proteins was also demonstrated in vitro, in presence of purified trypsin. In these experiments, PPO activity increased during the first four hours and remained stable thereafter, indicating that the protein domains responsible for catalytic activity are quite stable. Research performed as a part of this dissertation has also demonstrated that wheat PPO activity is influenced by strong anionic detergents such as SDS and N-lauroylsarcosine. The corresponding experiments indicated that these detergents influenced both enzyme extraction and activity, at least in high-PPO wheat varieties. This work also has practical aspects, making PPO assays (as used by breeders for germplasm screening) more robust. In conclusion, as a result of this dissertation, wheat PPOs have emerged as a fascinating example of a plant multigene family with complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/jukanti/JukantiA1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil Penetrometer with Ramon Sampling, Fluorescence and Reflected Light Imaging: A Feasibility Study</field><field name="creator">Kadiri, Youssef</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the feasibility and capabilities of a Fluorescence Imaging and Raman Probe (FIRP).

Furthermore, this thesis will delineate how this penetrometer may be used to detect underground constituents and pollutants present on our own planet. The proposed FIRP will be incorporated into a penetrometer that will go several meters below the surface seeking bio-signatures and information about soil composition. Microscopic imaging with reflected light will provide morphological context, fluorescence imaging can provide biomass detection, and Raman spectrometry can provide chemical identification of imaged material. The fluorescence technique will mainly depend on the performance of a non-cooled low-noise monochrome imaging camera, optical filters, and high efficiency light emitting diodes in the UV and visible. This miniature instrument will be connected by optical fiber to a surface platform that will host the Raman spectrometer and Raman laser excitation source. This thesis will show the experimental results of a bench-top proof of concept system. Images and spectra were collected and analyzed. Important choices and characteristics of the optical design are discussed relative to Raman and fluorescence detection. Finally, the thesis will propose a prototype of a compact device that combines both sensing methods and is compatible with a penetrometer platform.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/kadiri/KadiriY0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting Adolescent Sexual Activity using Individual, Familial, and Extra-Familial Variables</field><field name="creator">Keller, Julie Ann Atkinson</field><field name="description">This study examined selected individual, familial, and extra-familial variables that predict adolescent sexual activity. This secondary data analysis used data gathered from a self-report survey, from 397 adolescents age 11 to 18 in three non-urban communities in the Pacific Northwestern United States. The study employed multiple hierarchical regression analyses to examine the strength of selected variables in predicting sexual activity. The final model accounted for 58% of the variance of sexual activity among youth. The best predictors of adolescent sexual activity were peer sexual activity, attitude about sexual intercourse, age, gender, mother\'s education, and youth college aspiration. These finding have implications for future research, practitioners and policymakers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/keller/KellerJ0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Search for Point-Like Sources of Cosmic Rays with Energies Above 10 (18.5) eV in the Hires-I Monocular Dataset</field><field name="creator">Kirn, Malina Aurelia</field><field name="description">We report the results of a search for pointlike deviations from isotropy in the arrival directions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in the northern hemisphere, carried out using a skymap technique. In the monocular dataset collected by the High-Resolution Fly's Eye, consisting of 1,525 events with energy exceeding 10(18.5) eV, we find no evidence for pointlike excesses. Pointlike excesses at these energies can arise from only a limited number of source scenarios. Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields are expected to produce large perturbations in the arrival directions of charged particles. A compact arrival direction excess at these energies would therefore suggest neutral primaries. Neutrons, however, possess a finite lifetime, thus any source of neutrons would have to be located within the Milky Way Galaxy. Results of studies of pointlike behavior in arrival direction of UHECR are ambiguous. While pointlike excesses have been observed by other experiments, previous studies of HiRes data have yielded null results and HiRes events do not support evidence for previously identified clusters. Our technique allows calculation of sensitivity and upper limits using Monte Carlo simulated sources. We place an upper limit of 0.8 events/(km&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; yr) (90% c.l.) on the flux from such sources, place more stringent upper limits as a function of position, and determine detector sensitivity as a function of position in the sky. We also consider the historically significant source candidate Cygnus X-3, an x-ray binary, as the focus of an a priori search and place an upper limit of 0.5 events/(km&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; yr) (90% c.l.) from the direction of Cygnus X-3.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/kirn/KirnM0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning Business Improvement using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Design Structure Matrix (DSM)</field><field name="creator">Kristof, Gary Michael</field><field name="description">Many management system engineering ideas and theories have evolved to help businesses grow and achieve their goals. Applying these ideas and theories to a business system is a strategic planning issue and results in a bewildering array of strategic alternatives for business system improvement. Choosing the appropriate alternatives is a complex and difficult decision. The most appropriate strategic alternative must be executable. To be executable the strategic alternative must not only be technically feasible, but must also overcome social and cultural obstructions. This research presents a planning approach to select the most appropriate strategic alternative and to plan its implementation. The planning approach is built on a planning framework synthesized from previous research. This framework involves the following planning functions: 1. Determine business strategic alternatives 2. Acquire business knowledge 3. Shape business for strategic advantage 4. Implement plan - operational engagement The planning approach uses Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Project Management Tools (PMT) and Design Structure Matrix (DSM) to implement these functions and plan business improvements. This research demonstrates that rational hierarchies appropriate for strategic alternatives analysis using AHP can be constructed. Business scenarios are used to show that AHP method prioritizes alternative strategies differently under different business circumstances. In addition, the data generated by the AHP can be aggregated into statements of work and input into DSM to generate a project plan to implement organizational design changes and achieve strategic intent.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/kristof/KristofG1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) Nesting and Brood-Rearing Sagebrush Habitat Characteristics in Montana and Wyoming</field><field name="creator">Lane, Vanessa Rae</field><field name="description">Nesting and brood-rearing habitat data for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) near Roundup in central Montana in 2004, Decker in south-central Montana and northern Wyoming in 2003, and Malta in north-central Montana in 2003 was collected. Sage-grouse hens were fitted with radio collars and tracked to nests. Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. ssp. wyomingensis Beetle &amp; Young) canopy cover, density, and height for nest vs. random sites and brood vs. random sites were compared to determine if hens were selecting for these parameters. Forb, grass, total herbaceous, and residual cover, grass height, and residual height were also compared. Nest sites near Roundup (53 nest sites), Decker (58), and Malta (45) were measured. Most nest sites near Roundup were in sagebrush (91 %). All nest sites near Decker and Malta were in sagebrush. Only nest sites in sagebrush habitats were analyzed. Nest sites had taller (48 vs. 42 cm, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01) and more productive (60 vs. 46 g of produced forage, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01) nest shrubs than random sites near Roundup. At the Decker study area, nest sites had greater sagebrush cover (22 vs. 14 %, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01), density (1.1 vs. 0.6 shrubs per m2, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01), and taller shrubs within 15 m (52 vs. 42 cm, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01) than random sites. Nest sites had taller shrubs within 15 m of the nest (30 vs. 26 cm, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.05) near Malta. Successful and failed nest sites did not differ between the Roundup and Decker study areas. Yearling nest sites had shorter grass than adult sites in Roundup (9 vs. 11 cm, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.05). Forty-four brood sites near Roundup and 73 brood sites near Decker were measured. Brood sites were not measured near Malta. Most brood sites near Roundup (71 %) and all near Decker (100 %) were in sagebrush. Only brood sites in sagebrush habitats were analyzed. Vegetation was similar between brood and paired random sites near Roundup. At the Decker study area, brood sites had denser sagebrush (1.1 vs. 0.6 shrubs per m2, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01) than random sites. Adult and yearling hen brood sites did not differ near Roundup. Adult brood sites had greater sagebrush cover (14 vs. 8 %, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.05), density (1.0 vs. 0.6 shrubs per m2, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.05), and taller shrubs within 15 m (44 vs. 37 cm, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.05) than yearling sites near Decker. Brood sites had less shrub cover at 4 weeks than weeks 1 and 2 (10 vs. 16 and 17 %, P &amp;acirc;&#8240;&amp;curren; 0.01) near Roundup. Sagebrush habitats comprised 97 % (151 of 156) of the total nest sites and 92 % (108 of 117) of all brood locations. Nest sites had 19-22 % sagebrush cover, 26-52 cm sagebrush heights, and total herbaceous cover of 13-33 %. Brood sites had 12-13 % sagebrush cover, 22-43 sagebrush heights, and 14-33 % total herbaceous cover. This study reinforces the importance of sagebrush habitats for nesting and brood-rearing sage-grouse. Management practices which remove this shrub would probably reduce the nesting and brood-rearing success of sage-grouse in central Montana and northern Wyoming.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/lane/LaneV0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Satellite Production Forecasts: Valued with Simulated Futures and Options Trading</field><field name="creator">Martin, Lucanus Earl</field><field name="description">Both the USDA and private firms are allocating substantial capital towards providing accurate and timely crop production forecasts. Production forecasts based on satellite imagery have been suggested as a means of making forecasts earlier, more frequent, and cheaper. This thesis attempts to determine if satellite data increases information with respect to crop condition and final production. If so, does the additional information have value and can it be used to make profitable trades in the futures market? These questions are answered using NDVI data for Iowa and Illinois. Jackknifed out-of-sample crop production estimates are calculated for both corn and soybeans for the individual states. A variety of models were used, each including different bi-weekly periods. USDA crop condition scores are also tested in some of the models. A model based on the current stocks-to-use ratio for each commodity is used to predict the market's expected production level. When the satellite forecast differed from the market's expectation a trade was made in the futures markets. Both futures and option strategies were tested. Results suggest that satellite based production forecasts may result in profitable soybean trades, particularly when downside risk can be reduced by trading options. Further work should focus on refining the satellite images used in the model and exploring more complex option trading strategies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/martin/MartinL1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project Task: Member Assignment Using Design Structure Matrix and Genetic Algorithm in Concurrent Engineering Project Management</field><field name="creator">Mazur, Lukasz Maciej</field><field name="description">In concurrent engineering, project tasks generally require the establishment of multifunctional teams to simultaneously consider various activities throughout the entire product life cycle. Team members from different functional departments of the company interact in every phase of development activities to design products and processes concurrently. This concurrent strategy increases the complexity of product development and design processes and makes teams difficult to organize. Without effective task coordination and team organization, the lack of communication and cooperation among team members in a large group of tasks could seriously delay the project completion. This research provides an integrated solution to overcome these difficulties. This research aims to model both project tasks and team members for the task-member assignments. To accomplish this, we develop an integrated framework that includes three major components: a project task model, a team member model and a task-member assignment model. The project task model optimizes the complex task structure using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), while Design Structure Matrix (DSM) identifies the three major project task types: independent, dependent, and interdependent. The team member model provides a quantitative representation for three important team member characteristics, namely functional knowledge, teamwork capability and working relationship. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and personality profiling using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) are used to obtain ratings of team member characteristics. According to the project task structure, quantified team member characteristics, and each member\'s workload schedule, the task-member assignment model accomplishes the ultimate goal of this research - assigning the right team members to the right tasks at the right time. The effectiveness of the developed methodology is demonstrated by an illustrative example.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/mazur/MazurL0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial Ecology of an Antarctic Subglacial Environment</field><field name="creator">Mikucki, Jill Ann</field><field name="description">The research presented in this dissertation focused on the microbial ecology of the subglacial discharge from the Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The major objectives of my research were to 1) define the biogeochemistry of the subglacial outflow 2) describe the microbial diversity of the subglacial outflow and 3) examine the impact of subglacial outflow on the geochemistry and biology of the west lobe of Lake Bonney, a lake that abuts the glacier. The subglacial outflow from the Taylor Glacier is known as Blood Falls owing to a visible accumulation of iron-oxides at the point where it flows from the snout of the glacier. The subglacial reservoir is thought to originate from the Pliocene Epoch (~5 Mya) when the dry valleys were fjordlands. The episodic release of subglacial water at Blood Falls provides a sample of what is believed to be ancient seawater trapped in the upper Taylor Valley and eventually covered by the Taylor Glacier as it advanced. Biogeochemical measurements, culture-based techniques, and molecular analysis (based on 16S rDNA sequences), were used to characterize microbes and chemistry associated with the subglacial outflow. Culture and molecular-based techniques, along with geochemical data, indicate the presence of a diverse chemoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacterial assemblage that utilizes iron and sulfur minerals for growth. 16S rDNA clone library phylotypes and cultured isolates were related to organisms that inhabit permanently cold environments. The biological and geochemical component of the ancient outflow changes as it travels from the subglacial environment to the moat of the west lobe of Lake Bonney and eventually into the saline deep water in the lake proper. The bottom water of the west lobe of Lake Bonney is geochemically similar to ancient subglacial outflow, but the microbial diversity in the two systems is distinct, and ancient subglacial brine does not appear to provide the microbial seed for the deep water of Lake Bonney. Collectively, my data indicate that the habitat beneath the Taylor Glacier harbors a functional microbial ecosystem that utilizes chemosynthetic and heterotrophicactivity to obtain carbon and energy in the absence of light.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/mikucki/MikuckiJ1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Response of Grass Species to Soil Salt Content and Coversoil Depth on Lands Developed for Coalbed Methane</field><field name="creator">Mitchem, Melissa Deanne</field><field name="description">In areas where land is disturbed to extract energy resources such as coalbed methane, improper soil management may result in soils impaired by elevated salinity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the emergence and growth of three native grass species (Pseudorogeneria spicata, Hesperostipa comata, and Pascopyrum smithii) as a function of i) soil salt content and matric potential, and ii) coversoil depth overlying a saline substrate. The first study consisted of nine treatments, combining three soil salinity levels (0.80, 5.0 and 11.0 dS/m) and three matric potential ranges (-0.1 to -1.0, -1.0 to -7.0, and less than -7.0 bars). Seedling emergence, plant height, aboveground biomass, and belowground biomass were significantly decreased by increasing soil salinity and decreasing soil moisture. A correlation analysis showed matric potential to be more significantly correlated to seedling emergence and growth than soil salinity. This resulted in large reductions in growth when soil moisture was decreased within a salinity treatment. Emergence for plants grown in elevated salinity increased as much as 26.7 % when moisture was high. At low soil moisture, elevated salinity resulted in emergence losses as high as 88.3 %. Losses in aboveground biomass ranged from 23.0 to 97.9 % at moderate salinity and 27.3 to 98.5% at high salinity. Results indicate that the impacts of elevated soil salinity are highly influenced by soil moisture. Irrigation will be an important factor in revegetation of saline soils. Also, investigators studying plant growth on saline soils must closely consider the impact of soil moisture on study results. For the second study, a substrate consisting of a mixture of soil and geologic stratum was salinized to an EC of 11.0 dS/m. Non-saline coversoil was applied on top of the saline substrate at depths of 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 centimeters. Aboveground and belowground biomasses were significantly greater with increased coversoil depth, with depths of 15, 30 and 45 cm producing similar results. Results suggest that coversoil is necessary to improve plant growth on a saline substrate, but applications of less than 45 cm may be adequate.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/mitchem/MitchemM0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting the impulse</field><field name="creator">Moffett, Jessica</field><field name="description">My primary focus in my paintings is the male figure.

In a perfectly competitive market with no information or transportation costs, all sellers would charge the same price. However, dispersion exists even for seemingly homogeneous goods. A prescription drug is one of the best examples of a homogeneous good because an individual can buy the drug from several different pharmacies but still receive the exact same good. However, prices for prescription drugs vary tremendously among pharmacies. The purpose of this research is to examine the conditions under which price dispersion exists. This study finds three major causes of price dispersion: differing amounts of search and information costs, differing degrees of competition in each drug market, and differing levels of variation among production costs. Extending previous research, this study includes variables that account for effects caused by differing market characteristics by using variables that measure the percent of individuals in poverty, the percent of the population over 65, and the distance from a Canadian market. Using variables that measure purchase frequency, number of substitutes, average cost, number of manufacturers, and whether or not the drug is a brand or generic, the effects of search, competition, and production costs are examined across drug markets. In addition, the effects of pharmacy heterogeneity on price dispersion are examined by developing a model for price determination. Several variables are used that control for differences in services and quality of pharmacies, such as delivery, convenience to consumers, whether or not the pharmacy is a chain, and location. Additional hypotheses are developed from the price determination models, and the effects of search and competition on prices are reviewed again using the drug and market characteristic variables.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/ohler/OhlerA0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical Investigation of Thermal-Hydraulic Characteristics in Three Dimensional Plate and Wavy Fin-Tube Heat Exchangers for Laminar and Transitional Flow Regimes</field><field name="creator">Panse, Satchit Pradip</field><field name="description">The plate fin-and-tube heat exchangers are used in wide variety of industrial applications, particularly in the heating, air-conditioning and refrigeration industries. In most cases the working fluid is liquid on the tube side exchanging heat with a gas, usually air. The current study is focused on two fin configurations, the plain plate-fin and the wavy-fin. These two fin configurations are numerically investigated in both staggered and in-lined tube layouts. The present investigation ranges from laminar flow regime into the sub-critical or transitional flow regime. The suitability of the eddy viscosity turbulence models for the flow representation in the transitional flow regime is discussed in this study. This study reveals that the flow distinction between plain and wavy fin has a profound influence on the heat transfer and flow friction performance of these configurations when compared on the basis of tube layouts. The obtained results also indicate that the number of tube rows plays an important part for the overall heat exchanger performance and an optimum choice for the number of tube rows must be made in order to achieve the critical balance between high heat transfer performance and low pressure drop. It was observed that for an optimum number of tube rows, increasing the longitudinal or transverse tube pitch causes a decrease in the thermal and hydraulic performance of the heat exchanger. For the transitional flow regime, the k-&amp;Iuml;&#8240; turbulence model was found to be more suitable than the k-&amp;Icirc;&amp;micro; based turbulence models. This suitability of the k-&amp;Iuml;&#8240; turbulence model was linked to the better near wall treatment by this model as compared to the k-&amp;Icirc;&amp;micro; based models. The results for the fin pitch study indicated that the decrease in the fin pitch causes a decrease in both heat transfer and flow friction characteristics for the transitional flow regime. The results also suggested that for the transitional flow regime, for an equal wavy height, the thermal and hydraulic performance is increased as the wavy angle is increased. On the other hand, for an equal wavy angle, it is decreased as the wavy height is increased.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/panse/PanseS0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Model for a Human Factors Based Design Guidelines Handbook for Residential Living Environments for the Elderly</field><field name="creator">Pendergast, Brian Daniel</field><field name="description">The elderly in America represent a significant and growing population. One relevant engineering aspect of an aging population is the suitability of residential environments for the independent-living elderly. Engineers, architects, and designers are increasingly involved in the design and assessment of residential living environments for elderly persons. These designs should consider the fundamental principles and techniques of human factors to make certain that residential settings enhance independence and overall quality of life for the independent-living elderly. One way to help designers with this task is to develop a design guidelines handbook. However, to ensure designs are appropriate for the elderly, a prerequisite must be that guidelines are based on sound human factors principles. Creating a design guidelines handbook based in science requires a significant amount of work, in terms of understanding the aging process, developing guidelines, and validating the applicability of the guidelines. Therefore, developing these guideline sets and compiling into a handbook is outside the scope of this thesis. The role of this thesis is to bridge the gap between calling for the development and actually creating the handbook. Specifically, this thesis presents a model to categorize and analyze existing guidelines through use of a research matrix. The matrix provides a human factors based context to view existing work and highlights areas for additional research. This thesis also proposes the expansion of this matrix to be used as a framework for a future handbook. In addition to the above research matrix, a guidelines development methodology is proposed. The methodology is a process that focuses on developing guidelines based on human factors principles. After presenting the case for developing a guidelines handbook, and proposing a methodology to do so, a rationale to implement a handbook is described. This rationale concludes that the injury rates experienced by the elderly may, in some cases, be substantially reduced, by developing designs that accommodate the decreased functional abilities of the elderly. Developing human factors based guidelines and a handbook might ultimately help designers with this task.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/pendergast/PendergastB0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scheduling Reentrant Flexible Job Shops with Sequence Dependent Setup Times</field><field name="creator">Philip, Deepu</field><field name="description">This study presents a new simulation-based local search approach for solving shop scheduling problems. Results for classical problems from the literature demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of the approach. Application is also shown for reentrant flexible job shop with sequence dependent setup times (RFJSSDS), a new, very general, class of problems. RFJSSDS is a generalization of the classical job shop, reentrant flow shop and flexible job shop problems. Multiple products (routes), sequence dependent setup times at the work centers and reentrancy of the jobs make RFJSSDS one of the more general and difficult shop scheduling problems. Examples of this type of problem include semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities and flexible machining systems. The solution methodology developed in this study features a new Simulation Based Local Improvement with Multi Start (SBLIMS) algorithm. The local search procedure modifies an initial feasible solution provided by the simulation module to generate promising neighbor solutions. A generated solution is considered to be better if there is a reduction in the total completion time or makespan. A unique filtering strategy is used to select and rank moves, using both task and resource views of a schedule. Multiple random starting points are generated in multistart fashion as part of the solution process. New theorems are presented that form the basis for SBLIMS. The SBLIMS algorithm was evaluated using test instances for several shop scheduling problems as well as RFJSSDS. A set of synthetic problems was generated to study RFJSSDS, because there were no RFJSSDS instances available from the literature. The SBLIMS algorithm was compared with various dispatch rules in the RFJSSDS domain and its performance was found to be better in most cases. SBLIMS was also tested with well known special cases of RFJSSDS: the classical job shop, reentrant flow shop and flexible job shop problems. The SBLIMS algorithm provided excellent results compared with those provided in the literature, establishing the generality of the approach for solving a broad class of shop scheduling problems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/philip/PhilipD0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Analysis of Diversity, Gene Expression and Activity of Mineral-Associated Bacteria</field><field name="creator">Reardon, Catherine Leona</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigated the diversity and hydrogenase activity and gene expression of mineral-associated microorganisms. Surface-associated microbes have been shown to dominate diversity and activity in the environment, however molecular analysis of sediment-associated communities is hindered by both inaccessibility to the subsurface and co-extraction of inhibitory compounds. In order to analyze microbial communities in which the environmental conditions previously had precluded the use of traditional sediment extraction techniques, biofilm coupons (metal, mesh cylinders containing surrogate substrata) were used to recover microorganisms able to attach and compete in a biofilm. The community recovered from the contaminated site using hematite as a surrogate substratum was dominated by microbes most closely related to Alcaligenes sp. (metal-tolerant), Frateuria sp. (acidophilic), and Methylobacterium radiotolerans (radionuclide-tolerant) which together reflect the acidic, metal-, and radionuclide-contaminated environment. Hematite, as compared to other substrata, was shown to recover communities most closely representative of sediment communities inhabiting the saturated zone. Surface-associated cells have been shown to express greater activity than suspended populations and mineral-associated sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) mediate the formation of different secondary minerals as compared to suspended cells. In order to investigate the affect of surface-association on enzyme activity, hydrogenase enzyme activity was compared in hematite-associated and suspended populations of the SRB Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Essex 6. Hydrogenase activity of surface-associated populations was higher than that displayed by suspended cells. Hydrogenase likely affects the pH and pE of the conditions immediately surrounding the cell. The greater rate of activity may be one factor which contributes to the formation of a mineral phase not observed in the presence of suspended populations of this bacterium. In order to determine the portion of cells expressing hydrogenase in the surface-associated populations, in situ reverse-transcription PCR was applied to the hematite-associated cells and all cells were expressing the [NiFe] hydrogenase gene. This thesis demonstrates that environmental conditions of contaminated subsurface environments select for microorganisms able to tolerate or utilize the contaminants. Also, the hydrogenase activity of surface-associated populations is not representative of the suspended cells thus indicating the importance of studying attached populations where enzyme activity likely influences the conditions at the mineral-microbe interface.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/reardon/ReardonC1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Size Dependence of the Magnetic Properties of Cobalt Oxide Nanoparticles Mineralized in Protein Cages</field><field name="creator">Resnick, Damon Aaron</field><field name="description">A major question in the physics of magnetic nanoparticles is how the size affects the magnetic properties in magnetic nanoparticle systems. In particular, the magnetic properties can be affected by finite-size effects or surface effects. It is this author's belief that surface effects and not finite-size effects play the dominate role. This study is a specific example of how to try to answer this question by looking at different sizes of Co&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;O&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222; nanoparticles. In order to answer this question as well as better understand this system, different antiferromagnetic Co&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;O&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222; nanoparticles of 4.35 nm and 6.3 nm in diameter were synthesized. These particles were determined to be relatively uniform and monodispersed. In this study, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction (ED) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) were used to study the physical and electronic structure of the nanoparticles. Alternating Current Magnetic Susceptibility (ACMS) was used to measure the magnetic anisotropy energy density of the different size nanoparticles. It was found that the anisotropy energy density increases with decreasing size, from 1.09 x10&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;acute; J/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3; for the 6.3 nm particles to 7.53 x10&amp;acirc;&#129;&amp;acute; J/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup3; for the 4.35 nm particles, consistent with the importance of surface anisotropy with decreasing particle size. Vibrating Sample Magnetometry (VSM) was used to measure the N&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;el temperature and coercive field of the different particles. It was found that the N&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy;el temperature decreases with decreasing size, from 40 K to 15 K, consistent with a simple surface approximation of the finite-size scaling theory, while the coercive field increased with decreasing particle size consistent with a surface model. The main conclusion of this work is that surface effects and not finite-size effects play a major role in the change of the magnetic properties with size in Co&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402;O&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222; nanoparticles. The evidence also suggests that the increase in the anisotropy energy density is due to the creation of a surface anisotropy component normal to the surface of the particles.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/resnick/ResnickD1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Microbial Fuel Cell using Biomineralized Manganese Oxides as a Cathodic Reactant</field><field name="creator">Rhoads, Allison Nicole</field><field name="description">Microbial fuel cells were designed and operated utilizing microorganisms in both the anodic and cathodic compartments. In the cathodic compartment we used Leptothrix discophora because of the microorganism\'s capability to deposit biomineralized manganese oxides on the electrode. Biomineralized manganese oxides are superior to oxygen when used as a cathodic reactant. In the anodic compartment of most of the fuel cells we oxidized glucose using Klebsiella pneumoniae. In one fuel cell we used Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, a sulfate reducing bacteria. Electrons released in the anodic compartment, from the oxidation of glucose or sulfide, were then used in the cathodic compartment to reduce microbially deposited manganese oxides. A redox mediator, 2-hydroxy- 1,4-napthoquinone (HNQ) was used in the anodic compartment to facilitate electron transfer from the microorganism to the electrode. The fuel cells with glucose oxidizing bacteria were operated for 500 hours and reached an average anodic potential of -441&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;31 mVSCE and an average cathodic potential of +384&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;62mVSCE. The fuel cells with sulfate reducing bacteria were operated for 136 hours and reached an average anodic potential of -470&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;44 mVSCE and an average cathodic potential of +419&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;59 mVSCE. Reticulated vitreous carbon or 316L stainless steel was used as the electrode material. The electrode materials did not have a significant effect on the potential of the fuel cell system. The average fuel cell potential for 316L stainless steel was 706.13&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;22mV and 759.75&amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn;73mV for reticulated vitreous carbon. When the fuel cells reached steady state we discharged them through a 510&amp;Icirc;&amp;copy; resistor and evaluated the available power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/rhoads/RhoadsA0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Science and Natural History Film and the Larger Media Environment</field><field name="creator">Ruggiero, Colin Ross</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to examine the ways in which science and natural history films are affected by the larger media environment and in particular, concentrated ownership structures. This first part of this examination is aimed at establishing that the corporate conglomerates that own the majority of mainstream media outlets and resources have sufficient control over the media environment to warrant speaking about specialized programming like science and natural history within the context of the larger corporate-owned environment. The remainder of the paper discusses the impacts this media environment has on science and natural history film. These impacts consist primarily of excessive commercial influence and a loss of diversity in programming. To explain and describe these effects, the paper uses a model of how the political and economic interests of these media monopolies led to a corporate bias and agenda that serves to filter the films that gain access to mainstream media outlets. This examination relies on a wide variety of data and case studies to support its arguments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/ruggiero/RuggieroC0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Soil Water Content for Precision Range Management</field><field name="creator">Sankey, Joel Brown</field><field name="description">I developed site-specific empirical models to predict spring soil water content for two Montana ranches. The models used publicly available Landsat TM 5, USGS DEM, and soil survey-derived data as predictor variables. The goal of the project was to test whether ranchers could collect a limited size soil water content data set, build sitespecific regression models based on the data set, and construct soil water content maps based on the models. The response variable for models consisted of 100 and 82 average soil profile mass water content samples for each ranch, respectively. Half the samples were used for model calibration and half for model validation. Multiple regression models had calibration R&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; of 0.64 and 0.43 for each ranch, respectively. Validation showed that the multiple regression models predicted the validation data sets with average error (RMSD) within 0.04 mass water content and regression tree models predicted within 0.055 mass water content. The majority of the validation MSD for all models was accounted for by a lack of correlation between predicted and observed values along a 1:1 line. Models were then constructed with decreased sample sizes. Regression tree models and multiple regression models constructed with 20 to 30 samples predicted soil water content with similar, though still limited, accuracy and precision to full sample models. Site-specific field and lab soil characterization data developed with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy modeling was used to assess the suitability of the soil survey based predictor variables. The multiple regression models with the site-specific data predicted soil water content with average prediction errors (RMSD) of 0.035 and 0.036 mass water content for the two ranches, respectively. Soil survey model predictions were statistically significantly different than site-specific model predictions for one ranch but not the other. Especially dry conditions were a factor contributing to the difficulty in accurately modeling and predicting soil water content encountered at both study sites. Landsat imagery from the peak of the previous growing season, DEM-derived slope and aspect variables, and soil survey attribute data each showed promise as significant predictors of spring soil water content, particularly considering the dry conditions of the data collection period.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/sankey/SankeyjJ1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Natural Resource Rents and Institutional Change</field><field name="creator">Scarborough, Brandon Christopher</field><field name="description">Recent literature argues that nations with abundant natural resources - primarily oil and minerals - tend to grow more slowly comparatively to resource-poor nations. Much of this cross-national variation in economic performance may be explained by the interaction between natural resources and institutional quality. Focusing on the importance of economic institutions in the form of property rights and the rule of law this paper presents an alternative explanation for the diverging economic paths in resource rich nations. Economic rents generated from abundant oil and gas resources may affect institutions or institutional quality. Further, that impact on institutions is itself contingent upon the quality of such institutions during the payoff period of the resource windfalls. The findings suggest that resource wealth has a positive influence on the strength of property rights and the rule of law (and thus, by inference on economic growth) in the nations that start out with strong protection of property rights and associated rule of law, but a negative influence in nations that do not. The results appear robust to alternative specifications of the resource variable.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/scarborough/ScarboroughB0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Profile of the Major Selection of Student Athletes at a Division I-AA Insititution and how they Compare to Students in the General Population</field><field name="creator">Schmitt, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">The purpose of the study was to determine what student athletes were majoring in, whether they differed from non-athletes at the same institution, and how being a student athlete influenced their major selection. This study addressed student athletes participating at a division I-AA University. The university is a member of the NCAA with approximately 250 student athletes participating in fourteen varsity sports. In the quantitative study a One-Sample Chi-Square was used to determine if student athletes differ significantly from students in the general population. Similar studies were conducted classifying the student athletes by gender and sport profile. A Contingency Chi-Square was used to determine if the student athletes differed from each other in the selection of a major when classified by gender, sport profile, and recruitment status. The qualitative study addressed how the experience of being a student athlete influenced their selection of a major. Results show that student athletes were not selecting the same majors as their non-athlete counterparts. Significant differences were also found when comparing student athletes to students in the general population after classifying them by gender and sport profile. Among student athletes, only gender was found to be a significant determinant of major. Results from the qualitative study found that athletic participation has impacted the major selection of college athletes in a variety of ways including: time available to devote to academics, the scheduling of classes during athletic practices, and the treatment of professors and advisors toward their athletic status.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/schmitt/SchmittS0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nucleotide Dependent Conformational Changes in the Nitrogenase Fe Protein</field><field name="creator">Sen, Sanchayita</field><field name="description">Nitrogenase is a complex metal-containing enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of nitrogen gas to ammonia. During nitrogenase catalysis the Fe protein and the molybdenum-iron protein associate and dissociate in a manner resulting in the hydrolysis of two molecules of MgATP and the transfer of at least one electron to the MoFe protein. The role of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in nitrogenase catalysis is one of the most fascinating aspects of nitrogenase function. The Fe protein upon binding to MgATP undergoes a huge conformational change which is important for subsequent steps of nitrogenase reaction mechanism. Therefore structural characterization of the Fe protein bound to MgATP will provide a basis on how MgATP binding promotes the complex formation whereas hydrolysis to MgADP leads to the dissociation of the macromolecular complex structure. Towards these ends we have conducted structural studies on a site-directed variant of the Fe protein which is a close mimic of the MgATP conformational state. Structural characterization of this Leu127 deletion variant revealed a distinctly new conformation of the Fe protein which arises from the rigid body reorientation of the homodimeric Fe protein subunits with respect to each other. The structure not only provides the first basis on rationalizing the initial docking interactions between the component proteins but also helps us to dissect the conformational changes on the Fe protein which occur upon nucleotide binding from those conformational changes that are imposed on the Fe protein by the MoFe protein during complex formation. Having this structure in hand, we have developed several other experimental approaches like Mass spectrophotometry and Small Angle X-ray Scattering/Diffraction (SAXS) techniques to probe the relationship between the Leu127 deletion variant a close structural mimic of MgATP bound "on state" and the actual MgATP bound state which is more difficult to probe crystallographically. These studies will help us to compare the different nucleotide bound states (MgADP and MgATP) of the Fe protein in solution that will help to predict the level of conformational change that is induced in the Fe protein that makes it compatible for binding to the MoFe protein in the nitrogen catalysis cycle.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/sen/SenS0805.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power Management for Microbial Fuel Cells</field><field name="creator">Shantaram, Avinash</field><field name="description">Monitoring parameters characterizing water quality, such as temperature, pH and concentrations of heavy metals in natural waters, is often followed by transmitting the data to remote receivers using telemetry systems. Such systems are commonly powered by batteries, which can be inconvenient at times because batteries have a limited lifetime and have to be recharged or replaced periodically to ensure that sufficient energy is available to power the electronics. To avoid these inconveniences, we have designed and tested a self-renewable power source, a microbial fuel cell, which has the potential to eliminate the need for batteries to power electrochemical sensors used to monitor water quality and small telemetry systems used to transmit the data acquired by these sensors. To demonstrate the utility of the microbial fuel cell, we have combined it with low-power, high-efficiency electronic circuitry providing a stable power source for wireless data transmission. To generate enough power for the telemetry system, energy produced by the microbial fuel cell was stored in an ultracapacitor and used in short bursts when needed. Since powering commercial components of electronic circuits requires 5 Volts, and our cell was able to deliver a maximum of 2.1 V, we used a DC-DC converter to increase the potential. The DC-DC converter powered the transmitter, which gathered the data from the sensor and transmitted them to a receiver. To demonstrate the utility of the system, we initially measured temporal variations in temperature followed by the implementation of a chemical sensor to measure copper and lead concentrations in water; this data was then wirelessly transmitted to a remote receiver.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/shantaram/ShantaramA0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Paintings</field><field name="creator">Smith, Stephen Connolly</field><field name="description">In the Lives, Vasari advises the artist to aim his arrows high, and above the mark which he intends to hit.

Sod, soil water control and forage species are key factors in determining the success of no-till application. Experiment 1 was conducted to determine optimum vegetation control and moisture on alfalfa in the spring. In experiment 2, adapted grasses and legumes were compared under tilled and no-till seedbed preparation to assess their performance. In Experiment 1, the effects of timing of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] application, two alfalfa cultivars (including a roundup ready alfalfa) and five irrigation levels were investigated in Bozeman, MT in an old alfalfa stand in a subirrigated location. Experiment 2 was planted contiguous to Experiment 1; 11 forage species were planted in early summer (24 June) and late summer (28 August) under irrigation. During establishment year, applying glyphosate four weeks before planting resulted in a higher plant population and alfalfa yield than all the other treatments. Differences were not detected in the post-establishment year. The establishment of no-till alfalfa was very low in the second planting year, likely due to wet and colder weather. Alfalfa yield during the establishment year responded significantly to irrigation level and the effect was not relevant for yield in the post-establishment year. No-till legumes and grasses in the summer resulted in yields similar to those following conventional seedbed preparation although higher in early summer than late summer. Grasses had about four times higher yields than legumes in part, because post-emergence broadleaf control was less effective in legumes. Late summer planting resulted in high weed encroachment and low target forage yields. These results indicate that delaying planting four weeks after spraying with glyphosate and controlled irrigation is a promising no-till alfalfa planting system but highly dependent on establishment weather conditions. No-till grasses offer an opportunity to impact the wide use of no-till to increase yield in an old alfalfa stand, but post-emergence weed control would be a key management especially in legumes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/strauch/StrauchO1205.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School Superintendent Evaluation in Montana Public School Districts</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Douglas Wayne</field><field name="description">The AASA 2000 Study of the American Superintendency indicated between 1950 and 1992 the median age of superintendents was 48 to 50. Since 1992 the median age of superintendents increased to 52.5, the oldest recorded median age for superintendents during the twentieth century. The results of this study indicated during the coming decade half of the nation's superintendents will retire. In 1999, the Montana School Boards Association, the School Administrators of Montana, the Certification and Standards and Practices Advisory Committee and the Department of Education at Montana State University, conducted a study that assessed school administrator shortages in Montana. The study indicated that 61.3% of districts had hired an administrator within the last three years. A study conducted by Dr. Dori Neilson (2002) for the Montana State Action for Education Leadership Project (SAELP) revealed that 48% of administrators in Montana school districts plan to retire within the next five years. Communication between the superintendent and school board is a mechanism that will improve relations between the parties and may increase superintendent longevity. A thorough performance appraisal of the superintendent can improve communication between board members and the superintendent. The problem addressed in this study is that it is unknown by state leaders and policy-makers to what degree, based on the perceptions of practicing Montana public school superintendents, evaluations of school superintendents in Montana are aligned to the Performance Domains identified by DiPaola and Stronge (2003). A t-test of Independent Samples revealed significant differences in several areas regarding alignment of current Montana superintendent evaluation practices to the Domains. An understanding of current practices for evaluating the superintendent in Montana revealed areas of improvement that will result in improved superintendent evaluation practices. Evaluations that improve communication between school boards and superintendents of Montana school districts will provide a framework to increase superintendent longevity and decrease the need to hire a superintendent in a job market that is experiencing a shortage of qualified candidates. This study provides recommendations for revisions of policies and laws governing evaluation of Montana superintendents and training of Montana school board members in superintendent evaluation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/sullivan/SullivanD0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Rodents as a Potential Reservoir for Pasteurella multocida on the National Elk Refuge, Wyoming</field><field name="creator">Swanekamp, Leatrice June</field><field name="description">Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) is a fatal disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants caused by the bacterium Pasteurella multocida. Although uncommon in the U.S, outbreaks of HS in elk (Cervus elaphus) occurred on the National Elk Refuge (NER) in the winters of 1986, 1987, 1993, 1995, 1999, and 2001. DNA fingerprinting of P. multocida from the 1987 and 1993 outbreaks (B:3,4 HhaI 036/HpaII 001) revealed the same organism was responsible for mortality in both years. However, testing has failed to find this genetic variant in healthy elk on the NER, suggesting reservoirs other than elk might play a role in HS epidemiology. I investigated the potential for rodents to serve as biological reservoirs for bacteria responsible for HS on the NER. Rodents are known to harbor P. multocida, may be carriers of variants capable of causing HS, and have been observed at sites where elk are fed during winter on the NER. I used mark-recapture techniques to determine densities of rodents on feedgrounds, feed-storage areas and other sites and removal trapping to collect tissues to determine prevalence of P. multocida in rodents on the NER. Weather conditions, age-gender class, and feedground characteristics also were assessed as risk factors for HS. I captured 849 small mammals, 283 of which (mostly Peromyscus maniculatus) were sampled for P. multocida. None were positive for P. multocida. These data did not support the hypothesis that rodents serve as a reservoir for HS; however, my detection sensitivity was low due to small sample sizes. Snow depth was the only weather variable significantly associated with the incidence of HS on the NER. The positive association between snow and number of elk dying from HS may be due to increased survival of bacteria in the environment under wet conditions. Calves and cows were found to be at a higher risk than males greater than one year of age, but, with winter feeding, there is no evidence that cows and calves were more stressed from nutrient shortages or crowding than males. All analyses of feedground characteristics failed to find a relationship between these characteristics and HS.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2005/swanekamp/SwanekampL0505.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Statistical Variance of Blood Glucose Levels of Medicial Intensive Care Unit Patients while on an Insulin Infusion Protocol</field><field name="creator">Ackerman, Kimberly Lynn</field><field name="description">Hyperglycemia has been shown to have many negative consequences in the critically ill patient. Many physicians and nurses have been searching for ways to provide quality care for the critically ill and decrease the hyperglycemia found in the diabetic and nondiabetic Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient. Many physicians and nurses around the world are studying the use of the insulin infusion protocol to combat the hyperglycemia and therefore decrease the negative consequences associated with hyperglycemia. This study was a retrospective chart review of medical ICU patients in three months in 2003 and the same three months in 2004 in order to determine the statistical variance of blood glucose readings while on an insulin infusion protocol (IIP). There is little literature about the nurses' experience with the IIP. The study used medical patients from the Billings Clinic ICU in Billings, Montana who met inclusion criteria. Patients from the 2003 population utilized an IIP from 2002 and patients in the 2004 population utilized an IIP from 2003. Blood glucose readings were recorded and analyzed using SPSS 14.0. The study found no statistical difference in blood glucose readings due to a small sample size. There were interesting trends in the blood glucose data from 2003 to 2004. The results of the trends could be related to a more proficient understanding of the protocol and the rationale behind the protocol from the bedside nurse, as they are the sole operator of the protocol. Imogene King's Theory of Goal Attainment is one to be utilized for nurses operating the IIP. The goal of the IIP is to decrease hyperglycemia, therefore increasing the health of a person. Imogene Kings' theory integrates a personal, interpersonal, and social systems level to attain the ultimate goal, health. Nurses operating the IIP can utilize Imogene King's theory to attain health for the patient.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/ackerman/AckermanK0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alpine and Cliff Ecosystems in the North-Central Rocky Mountains</field><field name="creator">Aho, Ken Andrew</field><field name="description">Data collection and analysis for managed wild lands is vital to their effective stewardship. To address this I gathered and analyzed data for largely undocumented alpine and cliff ecosystems located in the North-Central Rocky Mountains. This information should aid in decision-making processes for regional land managers and increase the overall ecological understanding of these systems.  This manuscript includes detailed community analyses of alpine vegetation and its environment on andesitic-volcanic substrates in the Washburn Range and the Northern Absarokas. It also places the Washburn Range and Northern Absarokas into a regional non-volcanic context by comparing them to alpine areas in the Beartooth Mountains. Cliff communities were studied to record common species and to describe variation with respect to water and substrate gradients. An understanding of both alpine and cliff systems is important given the growing presence of exotic mountain goats (Oreomnos americanus) in the region, and concerns over the impact of global climate change to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, particularly in alpine areas. I also present here a number of original methods which should be of interest to ecologists. These include (1) methods for identifying objectively appropriate vegetation classification methods, and finding the correct number of data clusters in datasets, (2) methods for studying important environmental parameters on rock surfaces, and (3) a new protocol for efficiently determining soil water potentials.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/aho/AhoK1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Cage Architectures as a Nano-Platform for Material Synthesis and Metal Binding</field><field name="creator">Allen, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">Supramolecular proteins that assemble into cage like architectures have been used for nano-material synthesis and as a scaffold for metal binding. Material synthesis can be performed by exploiting the cage-like properties of these nano-containers and relying on the electrostatically distinct interior environment that drive mineral encapsulation. Ferritin and ferritin like proteins can be used as size constrained reaction vessels that encapsulate materials that have sizes that are determined by the internal dimensions of the protein cage. These range from 5 nm for the ferritin like protein from Listeria innocua to 24 nm for the interior of an engineered plant virus (Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus). Inorganic materials synthesized within these constrained reaction volumes are monodisperse in size. The crystallinity and phase of material prepared is determined by the reaction conditions, which are mild compared to other preparative methods. The metal binding affinity of certain viral protein cages allows the study of the role that metals play in such processes as viral assembly and infection as well as transmission. If paramagnetic metal ions are bound to the viral protein cage, the biological scaffold has potential use as an MRI contrast agent. Here multiple protein cage platforms are discussed with an emphasis on engineering non-native functionality to many of the protein cages. Engineering nonnative function to protein cages involves both genetic and chemical modification for the purpose of increasing stability and changing electrostatic interactions. Together these modifications serve to reinforce the versatility of protein cage architectures for both mineral synthesis and metal binding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/allen/AllenM0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bringing Medicine to the Masses: Exploring the Relationship Between the Medical Documentary and the Public</field><field name="creator">Backus, Alison Lorraine</field><field name="description">The medical documentary seeks to bridge the gap between the traditional imbalance of knowledge between the patient and her medical practitioner.

Yet much of the public is still either hostile to or misunderstands evolution and its mechanisms. Television provides the bulk of the general public's exposure to science once formal education has ended. The rhetorical strategies employed by much of science and evolution programming, along with an emphasis on content over process, delivers the message that science is a search for absolute truths rather than a dynamic process relying on falsification and tentative knowledge. The way in which science and evolution is presented parallels failures in the educational system to teach science as more than just a collection of absolute truths and unassailable facts. In both science teaching and science television, critical thinking often loses out. Science television, especially that dealing with evolutionary themes from the distant past, tends to reinforce an authoritarian view of science by using visual images that are difficult to argue with, and an omniscient narrator. Evolution, and much of science, is counterintuitive and difficult to learn. Presenting subject matter in the absence of context is inadequate for building epistemological structures. Producers, like teachers, must first gain a mastery of the true nature of science in addition to the subject matter they cover, in order to encourage critical thinking in their audiences. Several television programs do an excellent job of this, even though they are far removed from the beautiful and expensive "blue chip" films normally considered to be high-quality offerings in science and natural history programming.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/bard/BardS0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Population Dynamics of Tansy Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) in Northwestern Montana</field><field name="creator">Bauer, Brad David</field><field name="description">Following the Little Wolf wildfire of 1994 in northwestern Montana, tansy ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) was classified as a state noxious weed. This project aimed to help prioritize the management of populations of tansy ragwort through an understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors influencing the species. Using field collected data and by constructing a prediction model, we found that the most important variables to predict the presence of tansy ragwort were distance from the main road, slope, cosine of aspect, and several remotely sensed LANDSAT ETM+ bands. Most of the predicted occurrences of tansy ragwort were within the boundary of the wildfire. The life stage and density of tansy ragwort plants in 94 plots in several environments created by the wildfire were used to project the population growth rate after seven to eleven years following the wildfire. Using the relative invasiveness (probability &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; &gt; 1.0) of populations to prioritize environments for management, the burned and salvaged logged population had the highest probability of being invasive with probability &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; &gt; 1.0 between 0.31 and 0.24. The burned but not logged had a probability &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; &gt; 1.0 between 0.20 to 0.10 and the non-burned meadow had a probability &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; &gt; 1.0 between 0.01 and 0.00. Additionally, as the native plant populations recovered, the population growth rate and rosette survival declined. Following a field study of the role of slashpiles in the establishment of tansy ragwort we found the highest maximum percent emergence of tansy ragwort seedlings in the low severity burn and non-burned disturbed environment of the slashpiles. The low survival of emerged seedlings and the low projected growth rates for the surviving plants indicated that the dynamics responsible for a large increase in tansy ragwort density did not occur within our slashpiles after two years. With the addition of biological control agents to populations of tansy ragwort, the seed predator fly did not negatively affect the relative invasiveness of tansy ragwort. However, the addition of a foliage herbivore to a limited number of populations reduced the relative invasiveness of these populations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/bauer/BauerB0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strange Bedfellows: Science and Storytelling for Broadcast Television</field><field name="creator">Bell, Andrew Wade</field><field name="description">Filmmakers exploring natural science subject matter that want to sell their work to broadcast television or theatrical outlets face a difficult challenge.

This combination forces filmmakers to present natural science information in an exciting way, and has led filmmakers to employ time-honored narrative structures as organizing strategies. While audiences seem to favor material presented this way, it calls the accuracy of the natural science presented into question. This paper will explore how and why the use of narrative became common to natural science filmmaking, illustrate the inherent incompatibilities between the narrative and natural science, and consider the repercussions of this filmmaking model.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/bell/BellA0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the Image</field><field name="creator">Bissell, Owen Edward</field><field name="description">Documentaries with science and nature as their subject matter have a great, untapped potential for art virtually unexplored in the history of film. A look at the general trend of these films shows a steady progression attempting more subjective and reflexive treatments of material, but science documentaries today are generally stuck in the classical expository mode. This lack of progression in films with scientific subject (including nature and wildlife) subject matter is largely due to producers unwillingness to break from the conventions of genre. In their attempts to create art instead of craft, the next generation of science and wildlife filmmakers will recognize that the promise of art rests in its ability to restructure symbolic representation and therefore change how an audience understands the world. This restructuring of symbolic representation is important and necessary because of hidden and oppressive ideological forces in society ratified by normal symbols. The new generation of science documentary creator will discard the notion of film images as facts and instead pursue a more ambiguous goal of truth. This may involve fabrication; a lie that makes us know the truth. Several individuals serve as examples in this endeavor, such as Brecht, Bunuel, Morris and Herzog. In their works, these artists employ reflexive techniques that elevate viewers consciousness. My own thesis film project, The Last Run (2006), demonstrates some of these techniques more successfully than others. Creators of the new science and nature documentary must break step with decades of established conventions, moving beyond a literal, objective perspective and embracing an imaginative, subjective treatment of their material. These new artistic science and wildlife filmmakers will have three goals: 1) Escape from genre and its binary tendencies; 2) Make art by altering symbolic meanings or representations; and 3) Choose subjects of political (even controversial) or personal importance that are uncommon in todays television programs about science and nature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/bissell/BissellO0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of the Central Bison Herd in Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Bruggeman, Jason Edward</field><field name="description">The spatio-temporal dynamics of Yellowstone National Park bison (Bison bison) are complex and affected by multiple abiotic and biotic mechanisms. In the Madison- Firehole area, which provides winter range for the migratory central herd, this suite of effects is particularly intricate owing to geothermally influenced habitats, severe winter climate, and variability in resource distribution. Understanding factors influencing bison spatio-temporal dynamics is of importance to Yellowstone, which is faced with managing a growing bison population that is expanding its range. I gathered data from 1997-2005 using field methods and used statistical modeling and information theoretic techniques to examine spatial and temporal patterns in bison migration, road and off-road travel, and foraging behavior in relation to abiotic and biotic factors. Numbers of bison migrating were related to density and drought severity, while snow, drought, and density affected timing of migration. The probability of bison travel and spatial distribution of travel corridors were affected by topographic and habitat attributes including slope, landscape roughness, habitat, and distances to streams, foraging areas, and forested habitats. Streams were the most influential landscape feature affecting travel and results suggest the bison travel network is defined largely by the presence of streams. Probability of travel was higher in regions of variable topography (i.e., canyons). Pronounced travel corridors existed both in close association with roads and distant from any roads, and results indicate roads may facilitate bison travel in areas. Multiple effects influenced temporal bison travel patterns. Road travel was negatively correlated with road grooming and I found no evidence that bison preferentially used groomed roads during winter. Snowpack, density, and springtime melt were correlated with bison road and off-road travel. Bison foraging area residence times were affected by the ratio of local to landscape scale snowpack, previous foraging experiences, and local and landscape scale competition. Bison patch scale foraging behavior was predominantly affected by snowpack, with biomass and competition having minimal influence. My results indicate bison spatio-temporal dynamics are affected by multiple, interacting, scale-dependent mechanisms. Overall, factors influencing resource availability provide the primary impetus for variability in bison distribution, movements, and foraging behavior.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/bruggeman/BruggemanJ0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Otherwise</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Julia Lauren</field><field name="description">The nine, largescale paintings of my MFA Thesis show, \"Otherwise,\" are artifacts from a year long exorcism of grief and anger over my young sister\'s terrible, yet merciful death.

Some wildlife and livestock graze this species, however, most large herbivores, including cattle and horses, avoid spotted knapweed and prefer native plants. Some herbivores may avoid or reduce their intake of spotted knapweed because the plant contains cnicin. Cnicin is a bitter-tasting sesquiterpene lactone that may cause negative post-ingestive consequences in the rumen. If an appropriate supplement and/or antitoxicant can be identified that will reduce the negative post-ingestive effects of cnicin to rumen microbes, sheep and cattle may consume more spotted knapweed and grazing may help control this invasive species. I determined the effects of cnicin, rates of an anti-toxicant (polyethylene glycol), and a nutrient/energy supplement, with or without polyethylene glycol, on sheep and cattle rumen microbial activity, efficiency, and mass using a modified in vitro system. Sheep and cattle rumen microbes were negatively affected by cnicin. Polyethylene glycol, at the rates provided, had limited effects on sheep and cattle rumen microbial response to spotted knapweed plant parts. The nutrient/energy supplement, with or without polyethylene glycol, enhanced sheep and cattle rumen microbial efficiency. Because the nutrient/energy supplement may reduce some of the negative effects of cnicin on rumen microbes, sheep and cattle may consume more spotted knapweed in the field when provided with the supplement. I hypothesized that providing a nutrient/energy supplement, with or without polyethylene glycol, would increase sheep and cattle intake and time spent consuming spotted knapweed in a drylot, and in the field in July and August. Animal behaviors were recorded by focal animal sampling. Providing a nutrient/energy supplement, with or without polyethylene glycol, did not enhance sheep and cattle intake or time spent consuming spotted knapweed in a drylot, or in the field in July and August. Therefore, supplementing sheep and cattle with the nutrient/energy supplement, with or without polyethylene glycol, provided in these trials, may not be an appropriate method for managing the spread of spotted knapweed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/cheeseman/CheesemanM0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relative Poverty of American Indian Reservations: Why Does Reservation Poverty Persist Despite Rich Neighbors?</field><field name="creator">Cookson Jr., John Anthony</field><field name="description">American Indian reservations have per capita incomes $9,000 lower than adjacent counties. This paper seeks to explain why using an approach akin to the analysis of country-level data. I estimate differences in levels of income and income growth for a decade where Indian economies were transformed greatly by casino gambling - the 1990s. I test several recent innovations in the theory of economic growth within the context of American Indian economies and assess how economic performance depends on veto players, human capital investment, and windfall wealth. I find that measures of rule of law, rent seeking, and human capital are the most economically significant predictors of the per capita income gap. In addition, the size of Indian casinos is strongly correlated with convergence and economic growth, suggesting that tribal investment in Indian casinos plays an important role in reservation economies. From the work done here, promoting economic growth through enhancing a stable investment climate appears to be the most successful development strategy. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader literature on economic growth by providing new insight into the way institutional quality affects the speed of, or potentially lack of, convergence.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/cookson/CooksonJ0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photosynthetic and Glycoalkaloid Responses of Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) to Colorado Potato Beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) Defoliation</field><field name="creator">Dinkins, Courtney Louise Pariera</field><field name="description">Photosynthetic and glycoalkaloid responses of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) to varying levels of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say) and manual defoliation were measured on 'Cal Red' and 'Russet Burbank' plants. No alteration in photosynthesis was observed on the remaining tissue of an injured leaf for Cal Red and Russet Burbank leaves defoliated by larval Colorado potato beetles nor for Russet Burbank leaves defoliated by adult Colorado potato beetles. No significant differences were observed between actual Colorado potato beetle and manual defoliation for both varieties. In both of the whole-plant defoliation studies, defoliation level consistently did not result in increased or decreased gas exchange parameters of individual leaves compared to undefoliated controls. There was no evidence of delayed leaf senescence in defoliated treatments. Plants defoliated by Colorado potato beetles had a significantly greater production of glycoalkaloids than in control and in manually defoliated plants for both skin and inner tissue. There was also a 32.6% and a 36.8% glycoalkaloid increase in skin and inner tissue of tubers from plants defoliated at high levels by Colorado potato beetles in comparison to control plants. Although a significant difference in glycoalkaloid concentration was not observed among the treatments in subsequent experiments, the skin and inner tissue of tubers from plants defoliated at high levels by Colorado potato beetles increased by 18.9% and 12.7% in comparison to tubers from control plants. For the experiments where glycoalkaloid concentrations were measured, there was a significantly greater concentration of glycoalkaloids in the skin versus the inner tissue of potatoes, in addition, for the initial glycoalkaloid experiment, the concentration of tuber extract required to reduce Chinese hamster ovary cellular proliferation by 50% was 10 times less for the skin versus the inner tissue. The dietary risk assessments revealed that the glycoalkaloid concentrations within the inner tissue of tubers from control plants, manually defoliated plants, and high Colorado potato beetle defoliated plants exceeded the toxic endpoint for all human subgroups at less than the 99.9th percentile of exposure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/dinkins/DinkinsC1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Novel Optical Transmission Method using an Inline Phase Modulator</field><field name="creator">Dong, Yanchang</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a novel optical communication technique that provides a second, low data rate channel on an existing high-speed fiber optic link. The second channel is derived using an acousto optic fiber phase modulator and interferometeric receiver. This method modulates the optical phase of the primary high speed optical signal with a low frequency sine wave. At the receiving end of the low speed path, an interferometer and band pass fiber are used to recover the low-speed signal. Information is carried on the low frequency sine wave by use of FSK modulation. The method is noninvasive in that the low-speed channel is derived without electrically, optically or physically affecting the performance of the high-speed optical path. The method is ideal for overlaying network management channels on a fiber network.

For populations of patients that have difficulty speaking for themselves, such as pediatrics, assessing the parent guardian satisfaction becomes essential. Rural areas face unique challenges with pediatric care including long distances from home to a healthcare facility and lack of specialized care. The causal model is used for the theoretical framework, which states that there are two factors that directly influence patient satisfaction. These are process quality and clinical quality. Demographic factors are also included because there is conflicting information of the correlation between demographics and satisfaction. There is little known about the factors that contribute to high levels of satisfaction in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study is to understand what factors play the greatest role in directly influence satisfaction of parents whose children are hospitalized. Specifically, the relationship between overall satisfaction and parent demographics, process quality and clinical quality were explored. The study is a descriptive correlational study with a non-random, convenience sample of parents whose children are admitted to adult in-patient surgical unit during an eight week period of time. The parents filled out a Pediatric Family Satisfaction Questionnaire (PFSQ) at the time of discharge. The total sample size was 13 with a 77% response rate. Overall, the satisfaction scores were very high. Correlations could not be established due to the lack of variability in certain factors. The study did reveal trends that are consistent with findings of previous studies. These trends include the reluctance to be critical of healthcare, higher satisfaction scores with lower levels of education and higher satisfaction with process quality.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/dosier/DosierS0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recreation Impacts on High Elevation Soils: A Comparison of Disturbed, Undisturbed and Restored Sites</field><field name="creator">Eckenrod, Brian John</field><field name="description">Mountainous regions comprise more than 30% of the world's terrestrial biomes and are valued for livestock forage, mineral and timber assets and recreation opportunities. Disturbance has resulted in major ecological changes in high elevation ecosystems, including vegetation loss, soil compaction, and reduced soil organic matter (SOM). Restoring high elevation disturbed sites has proven challenging for many years, possibly because of our limited knowledge of disturbance effects on belowground biota, and the ecosystem functions they facilitate. This research compares soil physiochemical and biological properties on disturbed, undisturbed and restored subalpine soils in two national forests in Montana and Washington. Soil physiochemical properties measured include soil moisture, bulk density, SOM, soil nitrogen (N; both total and plant available), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K). Biological processes measured include mycorrhizal infectivity potential (MIP), decomposition, enzyme activity, substrate induced respiration (SIR) and N mineralization. Soil moisture and SOM were significantly lower, while bulk density was higher, on disturbed sites. Total nitrogen (N) was lower on disturbed sites, while NO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; - and NH&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8222; + differed only between geographic locations. MIP was low overall and did not differ between disturbance. Decomposition rates did not differ between disturbance after 3, 12 or 24 months. Enzyme activity differed with disturbance and location, with significantly lower activity on disturbed sites for 1 substrate, while nearly significant lower activities for 4 out of 8 substrates measured. SIR differed with disturbance and location, with lower responses on disturbed sites for 6 of 26 substrates. Soil physiochemical and biological characteristics are affected by disturbance and location, however results vary between the parameters measured. This suggests ecosystem components, including soil physiochemical and biological properties are decoupled, responding individualistically to disturbance and restoration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/eckenrod/EckenrodB0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Cage Architectures for Targeted Therapeutic and Imaging Agent Delivery</field><field name="creator">Flenniken, Michelle Lynne</field><field name="description">Protein cage architectures such as viral capsids, heat shock proteins, and ferritins are naturally occurring spherical structures that are potentially useful nanoscale platforms for biomedical applications. This dissertation work demonstrates the utility of protein cages including their use as therapeutic and imaging agent delivery systems. Protein cage architectures have clearly demarcated exterior, interior, and interface surfaces and their structures are known to atomic level resolution. This information is essential for the engineering of functionalized nanoparticles via both chemical and genetic modification. In the process of tailoring protein cage architectures for particular applications, fundamental information about the architectures themselves is gained. The present work describes endeavors toward the use of three different protein cage architectures, the Cowpea chlorotic mottle viral capsid (CCMV), a small heat shock protein (Hsp) architecture originally isolated from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, and human H-chain ferritin, as cell-specific therapeutic and imaging agent delivery systems. Each protein cage is roughly spherical, but their sizes differ; CCMV is 28 nm in diameter, whereas Hsp and HFn are 12 nm in diameter. The advantages and disadvantages of all three architectures are described. Wild type and genetic variants of the Hsp, HFn, and CCMV cages were reacted for the site specific attachment of organic molecules such as therapeutic agents, imaging agents, and targeting ligands. Inorganic chemical modification of the cages was employed for the formation iron oxide nanoparticles which are potentially useful as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents. Toward the development of the Hsp platform for therapeutic delivery, the antitumor agent doxorubicin was covalently bound on the interior of the cage and selectively released via a pH dependant trigger. In addition, mammalian cell-specific targeting was imparted to the Hsp and HFn cages by both genetic and chemical strategies. Biodistribution studies of Hsp and CCMV were performed in nai&amp;Igrave;&#710;ve and pre-immunized mice and Hsp cages localized to human tumor xenografts in mice. Together these results demonstrate the utility of the protein cages as robust nanoscale platforms for the synthesis of both soft (organic) and hard (inorganic) materials.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/flenniken/FlennikenM0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A review of the ironclad beetles of the world (Coleoptera: Zopheridae: phellopsini and zopherini</field><field name="creator">Foley, Ian Andrew</field><field name="description">Phellopsis LeConte is revised.

Bison are keystone herbivores in YNP, and are central to several management controversies due to their infection with brucellosis. I integrated 100 years of historical count data with 7 years of recent vital rate data, and parameterized a matrix model using these vital rates to validate population growth estimates and to project future management scenarios involving disease control through vaccination and/or culling programs. From count data, I determined that historical population growth rates were heavily influenced by supplemental feeding, resulting in high population growth rates (&amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; = 1.17). I found evidence for density dependence in two subpopulations, the northern and central herds. The herds displayed divergent population dynamics over 1970-1981 and 1982-2000, as density dependence weakened in the northern herd and increased in the central herd, and herd growth rates were negatively correlated after 1982 (R&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;=0.40, P&lt;0.01) I postulate the severe winter of 1982 catalyzed emigration from the central herd to the northern herd. Survival and birth rates did not differ between the herds 1995-2001, and calf-adult ratios did not differ between the herds or the periods. I found that snow pack was negatively associated with the central herd population growth rates, and with spring calf ratios and recruitment (R&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;=0.26-0.60, P&lt;0.05). Birth rates were not variable with density-dependent or density-independent factors, but did vary according to serological status for brucellosis and with age structure, as primiparous bison had lower birth rates than adults. I did not detect reproductive or survival senescence. Adult survival rates were high and static (0.92). Integrating these vital rates into a matrix model resulted in a population growth rate estimate of &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo;=1.07, which closely corroborated an estimate of &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; from count data during 1990-2000 (&amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo;=1.05). Simulating the effects of brucellosis eradication through vaccination programs resulted in &amp;Icirc;&amp;raquo; = 1.09, roughly a 29% increase.

Based upon Aristotle's Rhetoric, there are two types of proof: inartistic and artistic. I argue that there is an inherent truth claim to archival footage based on its indexical bond to the historical event it captures and suspends in time, which gives the footage merit as evidence. However, evidence alone is not absolute truth. All evidence is subject to interpretation and argument. Once archival footage is placed into the larger context of a documentary film to support or refute an argument about a particular historical event, it becomes artistic proof. I use examples such as the Zapruder and Holliday footage to demonstrate inartistic proof (the truth claim of footage), and the compilation films of Emile de Antonio and Esther Shub to demonstrate the use of Aristotle's three types of artistic proof: ethical, emotional, and demonstrative. The final section of this essay discusses my film, The Great Ocean of Truth, which is a compilation film, and its use of context to create meaning, and the importance of both inartistic and artistic proofs in documentary rhetoric.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/grue/GrueA0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recruitment Probabilities and Reproductive Costs for Weddell Seals in Erebus Bay, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Hadley, Gillian Louise</field><field name="description">The study of life history traits such as age at first reproduction and the evaluation of recruitment probabilities and reproductive costs allow insight regarding the diverse factors and mechanisms shaping reproductive strategies. We investigated these mechanisms using a 26-year mark-resight dataset for Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in Erebus Bay, Antarctica. Mean age at first reproduction was 7.62 years of age (SD=1.71), but varied from four to 14 suggesting the presence of important heterogeneity in quality among females. Survival rate was maximized for offspring of age-14 mothers (&amp;Iuml;&#8224;=0.70 [S&amp;Atilde;&#352;=0.08]), whereas recruitment probability was highest for pups born to youngest-breeding mothers. For example, probability of recruitment at age 7 was an average of 43% lower for seals born to age-14 mothers than for seals born to age-6 mothers. These results suggest the influence of countervailing selection (where favored genotypes for reproductive success are generally those that are selected against as juveniles). Sea-ice extent affected annual recruitment rates, likely due to cascading effects of oceanographic conditions on marine primary productivity and fluctuations in food availability for female Weddell seals. Results from the reproductive cost analysis strongly supported the presence of reproductive costs to survival (&amp;Iuml;&#8224; was 0.91 for breeders versus 0.94 for nonbreeders). Costs to fecundity were present for first-time breeders (mean probability of breeding the next year was 0.20 lower for first-time breeders than for experienced breeders). Females that delayed breeding until later in life experienced highest reproductive costs to fecundity, possibly due to their inferiority relative to other individuals in the population, again suggesting the influence of heterogeneity in individual quality. From these analyses we have gained insight into 1) the extent of within-population variation in important life-history characteristics for a long-lived species, and 2) the sources of this variation and potential linkages with environmental variables. Keys to future research will be 1) explaining variation in individual quality with random effects models or by using mass as an indicator variable, and 2) more detailed exploration of appropriate climate and sea-ice indices to elucidate linkages between this top trophic level predator and variation in the Antarctic marine environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/hadley/HadleyG0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nature/Culture and Fly Fishing in the New West</field><field name="creator">Hostetler, Jeffrey William</field><field name="description">Cultural theorists define the New West as the region including most portions of the states of Washington, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and the entire portions of Idaho, Utah, Nevada, and Arizona. Their term assumes, as does anything new, that there was an Old West as well, possessing distinct characteristics from the New. What analyses of historical, cultural, and theoretical texts reveal is the seamlessness of terms such as New and Old; that throughout this region, the complications and conflict involved around limited resources like water, wildlife, and timber have always existed. No particular date signifies when the Old began, nor when the New commenced. However, to illustrate these complications, many define the New West with stuff--private jet ports, jet skis, ski resorts, espresso bars, and micro brew pubs are all characteristics of a New West rife with competition and commodities. One crucial concept to acknowledge is the wider perception that the environment of the West offers a regenerative therapy unlike any other region in the U.S. Herein I utilize the activity of fly fishing and its corresponding literature in the last half of the twentieth century as a microcosm of the larger New West cultural (political, economic, recreational, environmental) condition to illustrate many of the same occurrences in other activities of the region. What surfaces throughout the analysis of the aforementioned texts is the notion of the paradoxical retreat-that nothing specifically in the Nature of the New West offers a retreat from Cultural pressures. When one escapes something, that thing is waiting upon arrival. Even the terms Nature and Culture do not work in a twenty first century discussion of the West; neither term stands alone, distinct and identifiable from its traditional opposite. Culture cannot impose itself on Nature anymore than Nature can redeem the ills of Culture, although throughout fly fishing texts we see a perpetuation of this myth of the West as a panacea. Seeing the cure-all as a myth will offer all readers the opportunity to rethink their actions within this region.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/hostetler/HostetlerJ0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote Outreach Cinema Campaign: (R.O.C.C.)</field><field name="creator">Kellett, Ian Alexander</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes strategies for the making and exhibition of films that amplify conservation values and efforts in rural communities. The films support and promote the missions of local leaders and the agendas of respected environmental agencies. The filmmaking strategies entail identifying existing conservation values as experienced through broad themes such as quality of life, economics and community development. By focusing on the collaborative process of making and projecting a film, these strategies serve to inspire innovative solutions promoting responsible stewardship of the land and sea. This model of media creation and delivery is designed to empower local politics and communities with the momentum necessary to plan a future consistent with their environmental values. I call this media creation and delivery strategy, Remote Outreach Cinema Campaigns (R.O.C.C.); Remote, because the media is targeted towards rural audiences, Outreach because the media supports the missions of established environmental agencies, Cinema, because the final delivery is on a large screen and viewed collectively. And Campaign, because the final film is only one part of a process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/kellett/KellettI0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Intrusive Fuel Cell Load Interaction Monitoring</field><field name="creator">Lackey, John David</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development of a non-intrusive method for monitoring fuel cells. The instrumentation demands that only the readily accessible AC output terminals of the fuel cell be monitored, making it easy to install on an existing fuel cell. The monitoring hardware senses the current and voltage output of the fuel cell and converts the measurements into the digital domain. The original algorithm to process the data was the Non-Intrusive Load Monitor (NILM) system which detects specific events, classifies and stores them. The software that is described in this thesis is a data specific compression algorithm that is used to store a continuous stream of measurements so that it can be processed off line. This gives the user the ability to search for critical interactions between the fuel cell and loads in the system after the fact, rather than demanding that load and interaction dynamics be known before the monitor is installed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/lackey/LackeyJ0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-Ray Crystallographic Studies of Sulfolobus Turetted Icosahedral Virus (STIV): A Hyperthermophilic Virus from Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Larson, Eric Thomas</field><field name="description">Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV) was isolated from acidic hot springs of Yellowstone National Park and was the first hyperthermophilic virus described with icosahedral capsid architecture. Structural analysis of the STIV particle and its major capsid protein suggests that it belongs to a lineage of viruses that predates the division of the three domains of life. Functional predictions of the viral proteins are hindered because they lack similarity to sequences of known function. Protein structure, however, may suggest functional relationships that are not apparent from the sequence. Thus, we have initiated crystallographic studies of STIV and expect to gain functional insight into its proteins while illuminating the viral life cycle. These studies may also provide genetic, biochemical, and evolutionary insight into its thermoacidophilic host and the requirements for life in these harsh environments. The first three proteins studied in structural detail are A197, B116, and F93. As anticipated, these structures suggest possible functions. The structure of A197 reveals a glycosyltransferase GT-A fold. Within the context of the GT-A fold, are the canonical DXD motif and a putative catalytic base, hallmarks of this family of enzymes, strongly suggesting glycosyltransferase activity for A197. B116 is a unique structure that lacks significant homology to known protein structures. However, sequence similarity to proteins from other hyperthermophilic viruses reveals conserved surface features suggesting interaction with a host macromolecule, likely DNA. The F93 structure reveals a winged-helix fold common among DNA-binding proteins, in particular, the MarR-like family of transcriptional regulators. The most likely role for F93 is thus regulation of viral transcription. Interestingly, B116 contains an intramolecular disulfide bond while F93 contains an intermolecular disulfide bond. The presence of these disulfide bonds was not anticipated because these proteins are expected to be localized within the host cell. This prompted analysis of the cysteine distribution in the STIV genome, which suggests that disulfide bonds are common in intracellular (cytoplasmic) proteins encoded by STIV. This work is in accordance with accumulating evidence that disulfide bonds are common stabilizing elements in the intracellular proteins of thermophilic organisms in general, and extends the observation to genomes of hyperthermophilic viruses.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/larson/LarsonE1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Piezoelectric PVDF Sheets with Conductive Polymer Electrodes</field><field name="creator">Lediaev, Laura Marie</field><field name="description">The main concern of my research has been to find a good way to solve for the behavior of piezoelectric devices that are electroded not with metal electrodes (as has traditionally been the case) but with a conductive polymer material which has a much lower conductivity compared to metal. In this situation, if a time-varying voltage is applied at one end of the electrode, the voltage cannot be assumed to be uniform throughout the electrode because of the effects of resistivity. Determining the voltage in the electrodes as a function of time and position concurrently with the mechanical and electrical response of the piezoelectric material presents an added complexity. In this thesis the problem of the piezoelectric monomorph is considered. The piezoelectric sheet is PVDF, and the electrodes are PEDOT-PSS. As a first approximation the two problems of finding the voltage in the electrodes and the mechanical deformation in the piezoelectric material are decoupled. In order to determine the voltage distribution in the electrodes, the piezoelectric effects were neglected, which reduced the piezoelectric problem to a capacitor problem. Once the voltage function was determined the mechanical deformation of the PVDF sheet was calculated given the known voltage distribution as a function of position and time.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/lediaev/LediaevL0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problematic Eating and Weight Control Behaviors Among Native Americans: A Meta-Analytic Review</field><field name="creator">Maertens, Julie Ann</field><field name="description">A ubiquitous clinical stereotype has conventionally associated eating pathology with White, upper-class girls and women. However, recent studies suggest that problem eating behavior and use of unhealthy weight control techniques span many ethnic and socioeconomic groups. High rates of obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes suggest that unhealthy eating behaviors may be a particularly serious problem among Native American youth and adults. This meta-analytic review of studies reporting the prevalence of specific eating practices among Native American participants reveals that on average, 18% of Native Americans report engaging in pathologic eating and weight control behaviors. Additionally, nearly half of Native Americans report body dissatisfaction, while 10% report chronic dieting, despite normal body mass index. Finally, compared to their White counterparts, Native Americans are significantly more likely to report body dissatisfaction, pathologic weight control methods, as well as binge eating.

Several strategies have been proposed in the past to avoid such an occurrence. Of the existing islanding detection propositions two schemes one of which is an active technique (the positive feedback technique) and the other one a passive technique (the VU and THD technique) are found by the author to be very effective but not without drawbacks. The principles of these strategies are combined to obtain a new hybrid islanding detection technique for synchronously rotating DGs. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid technique is more effective than each of the above schemes. Simulation results are given for two testbeds to verify the advantages of the proposed hybrid islanding detection technique.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/menon/MenonV0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perceptions</field><field name="creator">Muldoon, Dara Anne Hartman</field><field name="description">My work is about the tension between the beauty of the female body and the underlying currents of dissatisfaction with that body, a stress stemming from a behavior that is enculturated in women from an early age and over many generations.

A coating application necessary for optical reflectivity may also impart to these ultra-lightweight materials a desired shape and to help maintain that shape in the harsh environment of space. When a coating is applied on the membrane substrate, stresses develop in the coating due to atomistic processes. These stresses are fundamental to the final shape of the substrate. Coatings applied to the substrate in order to maintain a particular shape are known as the 'stress coating prescription'. As there is no way one could directly measure stresses in the coatings experimentally, in this work it will be explained how finite element analysis (FEA) was used in estimating stresses in the coatings. This work mainly comprises static pressuredeflection tests (bulge tests) on the coated and uncoated membranes, and a comparison of the experimental results to FEA findings in order to estimate the stresses in the coatings. Before FEA results are matched with the experimental results, an analytical solution to the problem in hand will be derived. Uncertainties due to variation in coating thicknesses and difficulties in coating process have led to various uncertainties in this work, and these uncertainties are also discussed. The ability to use changes in vibration frequency as a measure of coating stress is also investigated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/nandurkar/NandurkarK0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Nursing Student Experience: Student Perceptions Concerning Factors Leading to Success in an Associate of Science in Nursing Program at Montana State University-Northern</field><field name="creator">Pappas, Mary Weber</field><field name="description">Retention of nursing students in nursing programs throughout the country is a concern in this time of serious nursing shortages. Educating nursing students is expensive, and when students do not persist in a nursing program, valuable resources are taken from other students who may be successful. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to discover and understand the program and personal factors that current students, graduates, and previous nonpersistent students reported as helping students in the associate of science in nursing program at Montana State University-Northern persist to graduation. The study also explored program and personal factors that current students, graduates, and previous nonpersistent students reported as contributing to leaving the associate of science in nursing program. A questionnaire was developed by the researcher using concepts from the literature review. For the quantitative portion of this mixed methods study, 114 questionnaires were returned from the population of 191 students who were admitted into the program in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Responses to this questionnaire are presented in percentages of responses for each participant type. Twenty-four participants were interviewed for the qualitative portion of this study. Those interviewed consisted of 8 current students, 8 graduates, and 8 previous nonpersistent students. Findings consisted of 21 themes. The major themes were that program factors of relationships between faculty and students, support of peers, and specific factors of the curriculum were perceived as resulting in success in the program. Personal factors that students perceived as helping them be successful include determination and commitment to the goal of being a nurse, support from family members, realization of how hard the program is, and positive self-esteem. Recommendations include developing strategies to promote faculty-student contact, encouraging student contact with other students to develop peer support, making specific curriculum changes, investigating financial resources so that students do not have to work so many hours while in the program, increasing prerequisites to the nursing program, and providing students with assistance in test-taking strategies, study skills, and stress management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/pappas/PappasM1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Proposed Grounded Theory about the Sources and Effects of Teaching Anxiety among Two-Year College Faculty</field><field name="creator">Pasek, Heidi Lee</field><field name="description">Everyone occasionally experiences anxiety. In fact, an appropriate level of anxiety allows for the optimal performance of any task. There are times, however, when anxiety becomes problematic, undermining one's confidence and ultimately his or her performance. For teachers, there is a specific anxiety, teaching anxiety, which can lead to long term struggles in the classroom. Teaching anxiety appears to be a predicament for a significant number of post-secondary educators; yet little data were found on the subject. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine perceptions regarding the sources and effects of teaching anxiety among two-year college faculty. The aim was to assemble details about those college faculty members' insights through an assessment of their perspectives on the sources and effects of teaching anxiety. The study was directed by the following central research question: What do two- year college faculty members perceive as the sources and effects of teaching anxiety? The following subquestions further clarified the direction of the study: (1) How do the participants describe their own or their colleagues' experiences with teaching anxiety? (2) What do the participants understand about both the immediate and long-term effects of teaching anxiety? (3) How do those participants cope with teaching anxiety if they experience(d) it? To propose a grounded theory, this study utilized partially structured one-on-one interviews with two-year college faculty to illuminate the intrinsic properties of their perceptions about teaching anxiety. A conceptual model of inter-related perceptions concerning the sources and effects of teaching anxiety emerged from the data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/pasek/PasekH0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and Transient Degradation of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</field><field name="creator">Pasricha, Sandip</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a model based approach to describe proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell degradation with time.

The thesis also presents PEM fuel cell models developed and validated on a 500W SR-12 commercial PEM stack. Several static models from the literature are reviewed in terms of physical effects, parameterized for identification, and compared using measured data from the commercial PEM stack. The dynamic model is obtained by extending static current voltage profiles to include temperature dependence, and by dynamically modeling the temperature of the membrane. After inspecting all these models a simplified model is used for analyzing PEM fuel cell degradation and changes in physical phenomena in fuel cell observed over a period of time.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/pasricha/PasrichaS0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Romantic Genius of Einstein and the Science Essay Film</field><field name="creator">Radcliff, Matthew Robert</field><field name="description">The image of Einstein as a scientific genius, a talent so elevated it can spill over the boundaries between science and art, requires the assumption that art and science are not simply different fields of knowledge, but are polar opposites. Despite two centuries of effort, the debate on the relationship of art and science is far from resolved; the notion that they are exclusive of each other is even less established. However, there remains a tendency to treat art and science as the two extremes of a linear scale of talent. Only an exceptional person, therefore, can straddle the line between them. The traditional science documentary aggravates this separation. Condensing the time and effort involved, through re-enactments of selected experiments, neglects the artisanal, hands-on nature of science. By spotlighting one (or at most a handful) of scientists as special, and condensing a large body of work into a small number of significant events, the documentaries give the impression that creativity in science is a rare occurrence. A new model of science film, based on the personal essay that is prominent in popular science writing (e.g., the essays of Alan Lightman), is proposed to ease the tension between art and science. The essay film, combining elements of the documentary and the personal art film, provides the opportunity to illustrate science as an inherently creative act relevant to all people.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/radcliff/RadcliffM1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Patterns of DNA Replication, Protein Synthesis, and Oxygen Concentration within Bacterial Biofilms Reveal active and Inactive Regions</field><field name="creator">Rani, Suriani Abdul</field><field name="description">Biofilms harbor both active and inactive cells and it is a challenge to characterize the spatial and population heterogeneity of specific activities within a biofilm. Spatial patterns of DNA replication and protein synthetic activity were imaged by techniques developed using staphylococcal systems. The first technique measures DNA synthetic activity by pulse-labeling with the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) followed by immunofluorescent detection of brominated DNA. The second technique makes use of an inducible green fluorescent protein construct that can be used to detect the capacity for de novo protein synthesis. These techniques were applied to biofilms grown in three different reactor systems. In all cases, measurements revealed that even in simple single-species biofilms, complex spatial distributions of anabolic activity occur. In a colony biofilm system, two distinct regions of DNA synthetic activity were observed, one close to the nutrient interface and another adjacent to the air interface. A similar pattern was measured by GFP induction. The dimensions of DNA synthetic activity ranged from 25 to 31 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m and the average protein synthetic activity ranged from 36 to 38 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m at the air interface. When pure oxygen was introduced, a wider zone of active DNA replication (45 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m) and GFP synthesis (59 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m) was measured at the gas interface. Oxygen penetration calculated (26&amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m) corresponds with the zones of respiratory activity (19 to 38 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m), DNA synthetic activity and protein synthetic activity measured at the air interface. The dimensions of DNA synthetic activity and protein synthesis activity at the nutrient interface ranged from 13 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m to 19 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m. The addition of glucose to the media increased the zone of protein synthesis at the nutrient interface to 33 &amp;Acirc;&amp;micro;m. Stratified patterns of activity were also observed in biofilms developed in two continuous flow reactors. While biofilms harbor regions of active anabolism, the techniques also demonstrate that these biofilms contain regions of complete inactivity. Such inactive zones may contribute to the special ecology of biofilms and tolerance to antimicrobial agents. The techniques, particularly BrdU labeling, are generic and may find application to many microbial biofilm systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/rani/RaniS0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Search for Archaeal Viruses in High Temperature Acidic Environments and Characterization of Sulfolobus Turreted Icosahedral Virus (STIV)</field><field name="creator">Rice, George Ernest</field><field name="description">Viruses of extreme thermophiles are of great interest because they can serve as model systems for understanding biochemical molecular nuances required for life at high temperatures.

The existence of oxygen concentration gradients within the biofilm was confirmed. There were in fact regions within the biofilm that were nearly anoxic, this was confirmed by use of dissolved oxygen microelectrodes. The size of the aerobic zone within the biofilm agreed with the size of the active zone indicated by the use of an inducible green fluorescent protein. We found that anoxia could explain some of the biofilm's recalcitrance to the antibiotics ciprofloxacin and tobramycin, but the effects of anoxia were not adequate to explain all of an intact biofilm's tolerance to antimicrobial treatment. It was also apparent that glucose limitation was not a factor in biofilm recalcitrance. In addition, dormancy within Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms was explored by use of a novel approach to labeling active and dormant cells within the biofilm using a strain of P. aeruginosa tagged with a stable, inducible, green fluorescent protein. Spatial patterns of activity were visualized by microscopy. Further, we found it possible to sort the active and dormant cells using a flow cytometer. It was thus possible to determine the relative viability of each population after treatment with the antibiotics tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.

This is a particularly important social problem in the home mortgage market due to benefits which have been shown to be correlated with home ownership. Minority and low income applicants may find redlining to be a major barrier to obtaining home ownership and the benefits associated with being a home owner. This thesis uses a data set collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act to examine the mortgage market in Montana. A major focus is the effects of redlining on Montana\'s American Indian populations many of whom face substantial housing problems. A theoretical model is developed as a framework for the empirical section of this thesis. The empirical results of this study indicate variables that directly affect the expected return of a loan are relevant to the lending decision. Other variables that do not directly affect the expected return of loan are also found to be important to the lending decision, suggesting that either economic or taste-based discrimination may be occurring. In particular, other things being equal, American Indians are approximately 8 to 10 percent more likely to have a mortgage application denied than are non-American Indians. In addition, regardless of ethnicity, applicants located on reservations are approximately 4 percent more likely to have their mortgage applications denied. These results indicate that American Indians may be subject to economic discrimination in which their ethnic profile is used as an indicator of the expected return for a mortgage loan. Further, the study provides some evidence that property rights in tribal reservations are less well defined than elsewhere, partly because of the vagaries of tribal courts under which these rights are adjudicated and enforced.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/schumacher/SchumacherJ0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plant Species Diversity in the Sagebrush Steppe of Montana</field><field name="creator">Seipel, Timothy Fridolin</field><field name="description">Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is abundant in Montana and is an obvious part of an assemblage of plant species.This community of plants; the sagebrush steppe contains a mixture of grasses, early and late season forbs and shrubs. It is found in semi-arid valleys and plains of Montana and the intermountain western United States, and has received much research attention regarding increasing livestock forage, or of wildlife's dependence on the sagebrush steppe plant communities.Yet, little information on plant species diversity exists. This thesis was undertaken to describe the plant species diversity in three intact sagebrush steppe sites in Montana. The sites were located in Gallitan and Phillips counties. An average of 130 species was found at each site documenting the high levels of diversity that exist in local communities. Diversity measures were similar yet the dissimilarity among sites was high, this could reflect the high diversity of plant species in sagebrush steppe. Of the species recorded none had a restricted range, and this may represent a high rate of migration among local communities. Contrary to a designation as mixed grass prairie at the Phillips county site we found most species representative of the sagebrush steppe and areas of the Great Basin, and the site may be better classified as sagebrush steppe. Introduced plant species were found at all sites. The Burke Park site located in the city of Bozeman has the greatest diversity and abundance of introduced species. The most abundant species were introduced forage grasses. Our results also found that introduced species were negatively associated with the distance to road or trail.This is consistent with other findings that implicate human population density and disturbance as determinants of introduced plant diversity. The implication that human related disturbance and transport of popagules are causes of introduced plant establishment highlights the need for prevention of widespread destruction of sagebrush steppe.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/seipel/SeipelT1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk Assessment of Plant-Based Pharmaceuticals and Biologics</field><field name="creator">Shama, Leslie Marie</field><field name="description">Biotechnology is evolving to produce pharmaceutical proteins in plants. Plantbased pharmaceutical production creates concerns of exposure in an open environment and contamination of the food supply. Consequently, quantitative human health and ecological risk assessments were conducted for aprotinin, gastric lipase, and LT-B expressed in maize. A comparative, qualitative risk assessment was conducted for conventionally derived and plant-cell derived Newcastle disease virus vaccine. Effect and exposure scenarios were modeled for each quantitative risk assessment and each scenario was based on a tiered approach in which inadvertent exposure through ingestion were examined to determine a risk characterization of the plant-based pharmaceuticals. The qualitative Newcastle disease virus vaccine risk assessment characterized risks based on the potential exposures to the poultry being vaccinated, to humans administering the vaccine, and to non-target birds. For the human-health risk assessment, the dietary exposure evaluation model (DEEM) was used to estimate the inadvertent dietary intake of the pharmaceutical proteins in food. The ecological risk assessment used Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the exposure of each protein in maize for four receptor species. The human-health risk assessments revealed that the most conservative scenario produced higher risk quotients (RQ's) than the other two scenarios. The difference in risks was attributable to the differences in toxic endpoints of the proteins. Although the protein expressions and dietary consumption were assumed to be the same, dietary risks between the proteins varied by more than 56,000 times. The human-health risk assessment revealed that risks will vary dramatically and depend on factors such as the specific pharmaceutical protein, protein expression, and exposure scenarios. The assessments reinforced the need for case-by-case assessments. The ecological risk assessment demonstrated that risks will vary between species and between proteins, based primarily on differences in toxic endpoint and consumption rates. It shows the utility of probabilistic, quantitative risk assessment methodologies and supports the human dietary risk assessment by demonstrating the importance of assessing risks from plant-based pharmaceuticals on a case-by-case basis. The qualitative assessment illustrated that fewer effects and contamination issues were associated with the use of the plant-cell derived Newcastle disease virus vaccine compared to conventionally derived vaccines.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/shama/ShamaL1206.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A New DC-DC Converter for Fuel Cell Powered Residential Power Generation Systems</field><field name="creator">Sharma, Rahul Rajiv</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a new topology for an isolated DC-DC converter for low voltage to high voltage conversions at high power. The proposed converter is targeted for use in fuel cell powered residential power generation systems, where low voltage to high voltage conversion at high power (&gt;5KW) and isolation between input and output are required. Conventional DC-DC converters like forward, half bridge and full bridge for such applications need to have high turn ratio in their power transformers, to enable the high voltage boosting. This high turns ratio of the transformers results in high leakage inductance which reduces the converter's efficiency and increases the difficulty in control. The proposed converter overcomes this problem by utilizing the leakage inductance for energy conversion instead of considering it as a parasite. This reduces the problems of low efficiency and difficulty of control, caused by the leakage inductance. The need for a separate inductor is also eliminated. Moreover the switching pattern of the FETs of the proposed converter is designed to achieve soft switching, to reduce the switching losses. Simulation results to verify the energy transfer and the closed loop performance of a 550W prototype are presented. Open loop experimental results of a 350W prototype are also presented. The concept of interleaving of multiple units of the DC-DC converter is proposed. Interleaving enables paralleling multiple units of the converter to achieve a high combined power.

Simulations results are presented that verify the concept of interleaving.

Along with an increase in recreation, injuries related to outdoor recreation are on the rise, earning a priority on the Center for Disease Control Injury Research Agenda. BACKGROUND: In Montana, outdoor recreation frequently occurs in the wilderness and involves facilitation by licensed outfitters. Basic first aid is required of all licensed outfitters in Montana, though little is known about the actual safety behaviors of outfitters. PURPOSE: This study set out to explore factors that influence the safety behaviors of Montana licensed outfitters, specifically the association between safety behaviors and both remoteness and health beliefs. THEORETICAL CONTEXT: The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used as the contextual theory to understand how attitudes and beliefs interact to explain health behavior. The constructs of the HBM are perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness, benefits, barriers and cues to action. METHODS: All 640 licensed outfitters in Montana were sent a questionnaire that assessed safety behaviors (actions taken prior to a trip, information provided, and items taken on a trip), remoteness and constructs of the HBM; a total of 248 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: The study found a moderate positive relationship between remoteness and the safety behaviors of actions taken prior to a trip (rho = .25, p&lt;0.01), information provided (rho = .16, p&lt;0.01), and items taken on a trip (rho = .17, p&lt;0.01). This study also found a moderate positive relationship between cues to action and all safety behaviors of actions taken prior to a trip (rho = .18, p&lt;0.01), information provided (rho = .31, p&lt;0.01), and items taken on a trip (rho = .22, p&lt;0.01). DISCUSSION: In Montana outfitters, high levels of safety behaviors were associated with greater distance between hunting or fishing sites to nearest emergency rooms, and cues to action. This suggests that past experience and possible risk of prolonged treatment time plays a part in preparation. Basic first aid may not be an appropriate choice for licensed outfitters, as the course traditionally does not focus on prevention, but rather focuses on early activation of emergency medical services and short-term treatment until medical help arrives. CONCLUSION: Using the information gathered from this study, a tailored message and tailored first aid course might better suit the needs of licensed outfitters in Montana. Rural Nurse Practitioners can take the lead in ensuring individual safety needs are met of clients heading to the wilderness, by facilitating wilderness-oriented first aid to licensed outfitters in Montana, by facilitating community education efforts and by advocating for policy and legislative change, if needed, to keep outfitters and outdoor enthusiasts safe.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/sobeck/SobeckL0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of the Plasma Membrane Domain Structure of Human Neutrophils</field><field name="creator">Stie, Jamal Talal</field><field name="description">Eukaryotic cell plasma membranes form an interface between cells and their environment and function to detect and interpret environmental cues. The work described in this dissertation examines the changes that occur in membrane structure during plasma membrane function in human neutrophils and a fungal opportunist. The body of this work examines how circulating neutrophils can remain functionally inactive in the presence of perturbing influences inherent in the blood circulation, and yet rapidly activate upon exposure to proinflammatory agents. It is hypothesized that the regulated modulation of plasma membrane domain structure determines the activation of blood-leukocytes, in vivo. Experimentation is based the isolation of blood-neutrophils in either nonactivated or activated (primed) cellular states using dextran- or gelatin-based preparative methods, respectively. Analysis of plasma membrane cortical components actin, fodrin, ezrin, CD45 and CD43 by sucrose density sedimentation, flow cytometry and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated significant differences in the plasma membrane structure of both neutrophil populations. In nonactivated neutrophils, cortical actin and fodrin were cytosolic, thus indicating the absence of cortical structure in this population. However, cortical actin and fodrin were membrane-associated in activated neutrophils showing the existence of a cortex. Fodrin, actin, ezrin and their respective anchors, CD45 and CD43 did not codistribute with the plasma membrane marker, alkaline phosphatase, in sucrose density gradients made with primed neutrophils. These latter results suggested the lateral compartmentalization of the plasma membrane cortex into compositionally distinct surface domains. Additional studies were performed to examine the surface-association of hCap, a soluble microbicidal component of neutrophil specific granules. Results indicated association of hCap with primed and degranulated but not nonactivated plasma membranes. This interaction was resistant to 1M salt but labile to 10 mM NaOH, indicating a high affinity association. In support of this, hCap also co-partitioned with detergent in Triton X-114 phase experiments. In separate studies, marked alterations in the plasma membrane lipid metabolism of isolates from Candida glabrata are correlated with an ability to survive and grow in vivo. Altogether, this work provides insight into structure-function relationships at the plasma membrane level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/stie/StieJ0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nuclear Radiation Awareness for Residents of Cascade County-Montana</field><field name="creator">Strand, Aven Lynn</field><field name="description">The potential of a radiation mishap is real and lack of public awareness only potentiates the devastating outcomes on the citizens in the effected area should one occur. Low-level exposures of radiation may result in cancer and leukemia. A radiation mishap can occur at a missile site, a research or medical facility using radioactive material, a fixed nuclear facility, during nuclear detonation, and during transport of nuclear material. Guidance and education for limiting personal radiation exposure and how to combat radiation hazards would effectively reduce the number of individuals exposed if such a disaster were to occur. The intent of this project was to create an educational tool that would guide the residents of Cascade County in radiation awareness and ways to minimize radiation exposure to themselves and their families should a mishap occur. The outcome was the creation of a brochure for Cascade County's Disaster and Emergency Services department to use as an educational tool for the residents of Cascade County for radiation disaster preparedness. The brochure provides an organized, reader friendly outline of prevention of radiation exposure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/strand/StrandA0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between the use of Technology for Data-Driven Decision-Making and Student Achievement in High School Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Sulser, Dennis Patrick</field><field name="description">The extent to which Montana school leaders of high school mathematics use technology to examine student assessment results and affect instructional and curriculum change is not known. Specifically, it is not known to what degree mathematics school leaders use technology in assessment analysis, and if that analysis is related to student achievement in mathematics. Educators and math students in Montana "AA" high schools are the studied population in this research. Math instructional personnel and building leadership were administered a data-driven decision-making (DDDM) diagnostic to determine their capacity for using technology in the process of DDDM. Educators from 10 of the 13 "AA" high schools participated in the survey. One hundred twenty-five educators in the 10 high schools responded to the survey, 90 math instructors and 35 administrators. The DDDM diagnostic was secured from Dr. Scott McLeod of the University of Minnesota's School Technology Leadership Initiative. Dr. McLeod is conducting extensive research on the DDDM capacity of 11,000 educators in the state of Minnesota using the DDDM instrument. Five different mathematics student assessment indicators over a two-year time frame for each of the 10 participating schools were gathered from the high school principal in each of the schools. The composite scores from the assessment indicators in each school were correlated to the use of technology for DDDM capacity in each school to determine if a relationship existed between the two variables. Although this study utilized descriptive and correlation methodologies, it also resulted in apparent differences between teachers' and administrators' perceptions of their collective capacity for using technology for DDDM. Calculated means for each category of the DDDM survey instrument resulted in a higher average in every category for administrators than for teachers. This difference between teachers and administrators has implications for leadership and increasing the capacity for DDDM in Montana schools. There appears to be no significant relationships between student math assessment outcomes and using technology for DDDM capacity of educators. The research indicates that Montana "AA" educators are not using technology for DDDM to the degree that a positive relationship exists between student results and DDDM capacity. The study concludes that a closer examination of relationships between the use of technology for DDDM capacity and teacher-created formative assessments should be considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/sulser/SulserD0506.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reclamation Effectiveness at Three Reclaimed Abandoned Mine Sites in Jefferson County, Montana</field><field name="creator">Tafi, Tara Christine</field><field name="description">Montana has an estimated 6000 abandoned mine sites, many with associated waste rock and tailings materials contributing to the release of high levels of acidity, heavy metals, and other contaminants, creating a risk to human health and the environment. Many abandoned mine sites in Montana have been reclaimed, however, little post-reclamation monitoring has been performed, and the effectiveness of reclamation has not been quantified. The goal of this project was to quantify the effectiveness of reclamation at three sites in Jefferson County, Montana based on soil suitability for sustaining plant growth. Vegetation and soil studies were executed using a stratified random sampling design. Vegetation measurements included canopy cover using Daubenmire cover classes, above ground biomass, and species richness/diversity. Co-located soil samples were excavated in increments to a depth of 60 cm, and determinations of pH, electrical conductivity, nutrients, soluble, and total metal levels were made. Canopy cover estimates ranged from 0-120% and biomass production estimates ranged from 0-4583 kg ha-1. Differences in species richness and diversity were observed between sample strata. The chemical properties of the soil varied greatly, with pH values ranging from 2.08 to 7.63, and soluble metal values ranging from &lt;0.1 to1001 mg l-1 for Zn, .02 to 20.81 mg l-1 for Cu, &lt;.01 to 7.39 mg l-1 for Cd, &lt;.05 to 12.26 mg l-1 for As, and &lt;.1 to 7.6 mg l-1 for Pb. Sum of total metal and arsenic (As, Cu, Pb, and Zn) concentrations ranged from 133 to 81448 mg kg-1. Associations between vegetation and soil chemistry were determined using correlation. Significant correlations between vegetation attributes and soil chemistry were found. These results indicate that reclamation at the selected sites was moderately effective in reducing human and environment risk of exposure to harmful contaminants. There are concerns with upward migration of contaminants, and the sustainability of plant communities at all sites within the study. Elevated levels of residual metals and arsenic, as well as low pH conditions may have a deleterious effect on the long-term stability of the reclamation at these sites.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/tafi/TafiT0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and Control of Hybrid Wind/Photovoltaic/Fuel Cell Distributed Generation Systems</field><field name="creator">Wang, Caisheng</field><field name="description">Due to ever increasing energy consumption, rising public awareness of environmental protection, and steady progress in power deregulation, alternative (i.e., renewable and fuel cell based) distributed generation (DG) systems have attracted increased interest. Wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation are two of the most promising renewable energy technologies. Fuel cell (FC) systems also show great potential in DG applications of the future due to their fast technology development and many merits they have, such as high efficiency, zero or low emission (of pollutant gases) and flexible modular structure. The modeling and control of a hybrid wind/PV/FC DG system is addressed in this dissertation. Different energy sources in the system are integrated through an AC bus. Dynamic models for the main system components, namely, wind energy conversion system (WECS), PV energy conversion system (PVECS), fuel cell, electrolyzer, power electronic interfacing circuits, battery, hydrogen storage tank, gas compressor and gas pressure regulator, are developed. Two types of fuel cells have been modeled in this dissertation: proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Power control of a grid-connected FC system as well as load mitigation control of a stand-alone FC system are investigated. The pitch angle control for WECS, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control for PVECS, and the control for electrolyzer and power electronic devices, are also addressed in the dissertation. Based on the dynamic component models, a simulation model for the proposed hybrid energy system has been developed using MATLAB/Simulink. The overall power management strategy for coordinating the power flows among the different energy sources is presented in the dissertation. Simulation studies have been carried out to verify the system performance under different scenarios using a practical load profile and real weather data. The results show that the overall power management strategy is effective and the power flows among the different energy sources and the load demand is balanced successfully. The DG's impacts on the existing power system are also investigated in this dissertation. Analytical methods for finding optimal sites to deploy DG sources in power systems are presented and verified with simulation studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2006/wang/WangC0806.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spectrophotometric, Mass Spectrometeric and Structural Studies of the Prototypical G Protein Coupled Receptor Rhodopsin</field><field name="creator">Angel, Thomas Emil</field><field name="description">Rhodopsin is the integral membrane protein responsible for black and white vision in low light conditions and is found at high concentration in the mammalian retina. Rhodopsin is a prototypical member of the G protein coupled receptor super family that control much of physiology. Improved understanding of rhodopsin signal transduction and amplification via coupling to the heterotrimeric G protein transducin may reveal conserved activation mechanisms that are relevant to other members of the GPCR super family. Described here are several studies that examine the molecular determinants responsible for heterotrimeric G protein coupling to metarhodopsin II, the active photointermediate of bovine rhodopsin. Employing uv-visible spectroscopy we have investigated the nature of the interaction between the C-terminal tail of transducin and metarhodopsin II. We have provided evidence that suggests the orientation of transducin when it interacts with metarhodopsin II. Mass spectrometry is a powerful technique for characterizing intact and digested proteins. We have optimized mass spectral methods for investigating integral membrane proteins, utilizing rhodopsin as a model system. The mass spectrometric studies provide the foundation for future investigations into agonist and antagonist interactions and the related G protein coupled receptors using molecular crosslinking. Development and validation of new tools for generating structural constraints for conformational states of proteins that are not amiable to more traditional structural determination techniques are described. Antibody imprinting studies on rhodopsin were advanced with the work presented here. The x-ray crystal structure of the anti-rhodopsin antibody K42-41L in complex with a synthetic epitope mimetic peptide is described. These studies led to the generation of a model of the third cytoplasmic loop of the photointermediate metarhodopsin I and constraints on the conformational changes in metarhodopsin II.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/angel/AngelT0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial Diversity and Zinc Toxicity to Pseudomonas sp. from Coeur d' Alene River Sediment</field><field name="creator">Barua, Sutapa</field><field name="description">Coeur d'Alene River (CDAR) in northern Idaho is one of the metal contaminated rivers in US. The sediments of the river are enriched with As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn which are toxic metals to humans and animals. It is hypothesized that microorganisms living in this river sediment can remove the metals and thus detoxify their environment. The objective of this work is to investigate the microbial communities existing in CDAR sediment using 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and 16S rRNA gene microarray (PhyloChip) analysis. According to our phylogenetic analysis, the CDAR clones fell into 13 distinct phylogenetic classes including 2 environmental samples, 1 uncultured bacterium, and an unclassified Chloroflexi. The major representative genera found were Thiobacillus (7 of 91), Azoarcus (7/91), Acidobacterium (6/91), Burkholderia (5/91), Flavobacterium (5/91) and Janthinobacterium (5/91). PhyloChip data showed the presence of 1551 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). 97% of the clone library sequences matched at various taxonomic levels with the microarray results. The results from the clone library and PhyloChip have provided the broad picture of the microorganisms found in the metal polluted CDAR sediment. To better understand the metal toxicity kinetics of specific isolates, Pseudomonas sp. strain JM001 from the CDAR sediment was selected for further study. Cell growth and aqueous Zn removal rate of strain JM001 was observed in batch kinetic experiments. It was found that cell growth rate depends on substrate and nutrient concentration and incubation temperature. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Zn to the cells was 0.024 mM and the 50% inhibition in specific growth rate was found at 0.011 mM Zn when cells were grown in nutrient limited defined media at 22 &amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C. The MIC was 1 mM Zn and 50% inhibition occurred at 0.515 mM Zn in minimal salts medium with vitamin solutions at 35 &amp;Acirc;&amp;deg;C. The results are significant to develop a dose-response model that will quantify the effects of toxic metals on microbial growth and inhibition in complex CDAR environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/barua/BaruaS0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retention of a Model Pathogen in a Porous Media Biofilm</field><field name="creator">Bauman, Wesley James</field><field name="description">The inadvertent or deliberate introduction of bacterial pathogens into drinking water systems can lead to serious public health consequences. As a result, rapid sampling opportunities within distribution systems are needed that can provide information on the source, species and fate of introduced pathogens. In this study, a porous media biofilm reactor was used to investigate the ability of an established mixed-species drinking water biofilm to immobilize cyan-labeled Escherichia coli 0157:H7 as a model pathogen. Test reactors were colonized with biofilm for two or three weeks at 0.5 mg/l C, resulting in the formation of thin and thick biofilms, respectively. Colonized reactors were then injected with slug doses of approximately 1 x 109 cfu E. coli O157:H7. Plate counts were able to successfully close a mass balance on E. coli O157:H7 around the reactor and were used measure the fractions of inocula immobilized within reactors. Compared with control reactors (0.22%), reactors colonized for two or three weeks immobilized significantly more cells (0.75% and 9.37% respectively). For E. coli O157:H7 passing through the reactor, retardation with respect to the bulk fluid was measured. Retardation factors (Rf) indicated that cells traveling through colonized reactors were significantly retarded compared to those traveling through clean control reactors, resulting in a prolonged washout of cells. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and direct microscopic counts were also used to enumerate E. coli O157:H7 cells. Threshold cycle (CT) values from qPCR typically underestimated the plate counts for effluent samples and were highly inconsistent with respect to enumerating cells entrained in biofilm or attached to reactor surfaces. Possible inhibition by biofilm-associated substances was investigated. Direct microscopic counts were not possible when homogenized biofilm was present and otherwise consistently overestimated plate counts by an average of 0.6 orders of magnitude. This data shows that engineered porous media systems colonized with biofilm may be an effective tool for immobilizing pathogens from bulk flow in drinking water distribution systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/bauman/BaumanW0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Review of Market Orientation Practices for Selected Public Carnegie High Research Activity Institutions</field><field name="creator">Beck, Carina Niedermier</field><field name="description">While many authors (Washburn, 2005; Newman, Couturier, Scurry, 2004; Kirp, 2004; Bok, 2003; Wolff and Bryan, 1999) have written about their belief that American higher education is moving toward a market orientation, limited studies have been published citing the actual practice or success/failure of an institution(s) demonstrating market orientation qualities. The purpose of this study was to determine if two selected public Carnegie High Research Activity institutions were utilizing market orientation practices (Jaworksi and Kohli, 1993; Narver and Slater, 2000) as evidenced in their organizational culture, to enhance undergraduate recruitment and retention strategies. Through case study research design the research questions queried whether a market orientation was present or emerging at two public Carnegie High Research Activity Institutions. Further, the study attempted to determine if an organizational culture could influence market orientation practices relevant to institutional recruitment and retention outcomes. Based upon the findings and the resulting conclusions, it appeared a market orientation does positively affect retention outcomes at both institutions. Further, in these two instances, it does appear that an organizational culture can affect the "market orientation-ness" of the institution. The findings do not indicate there is conclusive evidence of a market oriented recruitment focus, with the exception of University B's effort to recruit specific and targeted groups.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/beck/BeckC1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Space Between: How Hypertext Affects the Author/Reader Divide</field><field name="creator">Becker, Michael Edward</field><field name="description">Authors and readers have been in conflict since the invention of writing, battling over the right to interpret a written document. This has artificially created a split between these two institutions, a split typically divided between those who have the power and money to publish their words to a mass audience and those whose words have been repressed by that publishing system. This thesis examines, through the lens of deconstruction and other post-structuralist threories, how hypertext and other digital technologies have empowered reader to take back some of the functions historically granted to authors. Through blogs, interactive Web sites, and electronic literatures, readers can assume a larger role in the creative process. However, with more power comes more danger for manipulation, as authors have also become more canny with the rise of electronic text. Though readers have more freedom, they must also face an increased potential for mediation and manipulation outside of their control. This thesis determines that although the gap between authors and readers is narrowing, many of the old conflicts are too ingrained to ever be settled.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/becker/BeckerM0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progress and Challenges in Non-Linear Constitutive Modeling for Composite Material</field><field name="creator">Booth, Eric Jason</field><field name="description">In this paper is outlined a technique for determining the non-linear constitutive properties of an orthrotropic laminated material such as a fiber reinforced composite.

Presented here are techniques for determining the mechanical properties of a material by solving what is known as the Inverse Problem.

The high relative velocity of the collisions promotes high reaction probability and large energy transfers, leading to materials degradation and chemiluminescent reactions, which may interfere with the mission of the vehicle. The work presented in this thesis uses sophisticated molecular beam and surface science techniques to study materials degradation and individual reactive and inelastic collisions in an effort to understand the complex chemistry and physics that are characteristic of space vehicle interactions with Earth's upper atmosphere. A new space-durable polymer, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane polyimide, has been identified. When exposed to atomic oxygen, this polymer forms a protective SiO2 layer on its surface. Beam-surface scattering experiments showed that collision-induced dissociation becomes an important gassurface process when the translational energy of the incident atom or molecule is greater than 8 eV. Experiments on the dynamics of gas-phase collisions at hyperthermal collision energies found that inelastic collisions may transfer large amounts of energy into internal degrees of freedom. The scattering dynamics of the reactive 16OC product from the 16O(3P) + C18O - 16OC + 18O reaction were quite unexpected, with 16OC predominantly forward scattered. Experiments on the reactions of O(3P) with H2O demonstrated the occurrence of a previously unobserved reaction pathway, O(3P) + H2O - HO2 + H, with a barrier determined to be ~2.6 eV. These studies of hyperthermal processes with molecular beam techniques have enabled us to identify a promising new material and to understand the detailed collision dynamics in model gas-surface and gasphase systems. In each case, the experiments have revealed new chemical or energy transfer processes that were not considered earlier. These previously unknown processes reveal trends in hyperthermal collisions that will undoubtedly be critical to the planning and design of missions that put space vehicles in contact with the outer reaches of the Earth's atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/brunsvold/BrunsvoldA0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sound Design for Non-fiction Film and Video: A Discussion of Methodology, Perception, and Ethics</field><field name="creator">Burge, Eric William</field><field name="description">Traditional documentary films, particularly science and natural history works, presume to authentically or legitimately convey accurate representations of historical events that actually occurred at a prior time. Factual and convincing representations are not necessarily congruent, and a film's merit of authenticity is often based on the perceived validity of the visual content represented. While visual imagery dominates a presentation's general delivery, a film's sound design is a fundamental structural element that is often overlooked or less scrutinized with regard to factual or accurate recounting of these same historical events. The purpose of this thesis is to examine methodologies of sound acquisition and reproduction and to discuss how various acoustic contents are perceived in relation to associated visual elements. While discerning viewers may notice critical discrepancies in picture contents that may invalidate a film's credibility, a complex matrix of sonic elements does not lend itself to deconstruction as easily. Thorough analysis of a science and natural history film must include an examination of its complete sound design. Consideration must be given to the ethical implications of using any synthesized or borrowed audio tracks if such a work is to be considered as "factual" documentary. The standards of acceptance or rejection should be no different than those associated with fabricating unnatural or contrived visual contents, no matter how compelling may be the end product.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/burge/BurgeE1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mosquito Populations in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming: A Comparison of Natural, Agricultural and Effluent Coal Bed Natural Gas Aquatic Habitats</field><field name="creator">Doherty, Melissa Kuckler</field><field name="description">Coal bed natural gas development in northeastern Wyoming has increased surface water in ranching and agricultural areas over undeveloped land. This increase of water increases larval habitat for mosquitoes, potentially increasing adult populations of West Nile virus vector mosquitoes. I compared adult and larval mosquito populations in four different habitat types in the Powder River basin including agricultural, natural, CBNG and upland sagebrush steppe. Adult mosquitoes were sampled weekly (2004) or bi-weekly (2005) using CDC miniature black-light traps baited with dry ice. A fixed-effect mixed model indicated that in a normal rainfall year (2005) mature CBNG ponds had the highest adult mosquito populations of all sites sampled, and the highest population of the WNV vector Culex tarsalis. In a drought year (2004) where total rainfall from May - August was 59% of the seasonal average, agricultural areas had the highest mosquito abundance, likely due to increased irrigation. Adult Culex tarsalis tested positive for WNV across the PRB in 2004 and 2005, with highest minimum infection rates in those areas with large Culex tarsalis populations. Larval mosquitoes were sampled bi-weekly from 13 May - 24 August 2005, using a 350 ml dipper in a 20 point vegetated transect along the pond perimeter. Pond vegetation characteristics were recorded between 3 and 17 August including vegetation density, type and class. Larval Culex tarsalis were the most abundant mosquito in the region, representing 47.7% of the total sampled population. A fixed-effects mixed model found Culex tarsalis produced at similar rates in natural, new, old and outlet CBNG sources; irrigated agriculture produced significantly less (P &lt;or= 0.02) Culex tarsalis in 2005. New and old CBNG ponds and outlets also produced Culex tarsalis over a longer period of time than natural or irrigated agricultural sites. This study indicates that CBNG ponds are significantly increasing the overall population of vector mosquitoes in the PRB, as well as adding to the duration of larval habitats that would normally be ephemeral. Thus CBNG ponds and associated habitats enhance mosquito abundance and may serve to increase pathogen transmission in an otherwise arid ecosystem.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/doherty/DohertyM1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solving Sudoku Puzzles with the Cougaar Agent Architecture</field><field name="creator">Emery, Michael Ray</field><field name="description">The Cougaar distributed agent architecture, originally a DARPA-funded research project, provides a platform for developing distributed agent systems. Testing its ability to solve complex problems using a large number of agents in an interesting topic of research. In this thesis, the Cougaar distributed agent architecture is studied from the standpoint of Sudoku. Through analysis and experimentation, insight is gained into both the properties and weaknesses of Cougaar. Cougaar\'s performance when solving Sudoku puzzles is then compared with other Sudoku solving techniques. The Cougaar agent approach solves Sudoku puzzles in a human-like fashion, reaching solutions using both analysis and guessing. Cougaar is shown to be capable of solving Sudoku puzzles in a distributed agent architecture.

Additionally, solving Sudoku puzzles with Cougaar exposed some reliability issues and demonstrated the overhead required for communication.

The American preference for the exotic finds its roots in the early African hunting films of Cherry Kearton, John Hemment, and Martin Johnson. These films became manifestations of the Pristine, a conceptual realm of untouched wildness filled with aesthetically-pleasing megafauna. Since then, visions of the Pristine, through the exotic wildlife and landscape, have remained popular in American broadcast viewing, as seen in Animal Planet's programming. Exotic wildlife broadcast film encourages viewers to engage in the roles of tourist, refugee, and conservationist. These roles, in turn, foster an understanding of nature that is dominated by seemingly plentiful megafauna, disconnected from humans and valued through a nature-importing model. The challenge in viewing domestic wildlife in broadcast film is that Americans cannot engage in the tourist role, one that highly values novelty and exceptionalism. In addition, Americans have become increasingly urbanized and separate from their natural surroundings. This separation between Americans and domestic wildlife may foster negative attitudes toward and misinformation of domestic fauna. Despite small steps in presenting domestic wildlife in Animal Planet programming, the prevalence of exotic-focused wildlife film has done little to bridge the gap between Americans and domestic wildlife. Filmmakers should reconsider the appeal of exotic wildlife (novelty and rarity) in order to foster interest in the vast array of generally unknown domestic wildlife. In a way films can encourage American viewers to become "tourists" to their own country's wildlife and foster the same positive values Americans hold for exotic fauna.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/fitzgibbons/FitzgibbonsR0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How Documentaries Can Help Shape How Society Copes with Death</field><field name="creator">Garton, Katy-Robin</field><field name="description">We live in a society that fears, denies, and attempts to conquer death. This dominant cultural attitude towards death is detrimental to everyone involved in the dying process. There is a collective of people comprised of doctors, therapists, parents, spouses, nurses, and children who believe in the human capacity to die well. This group of individuals has a vision for transforming how we die in our country. At the center of that vision is an effort to effectively communicate to the general public that there is a crisis surrounding end-of-life experiences. Moreover, this group of individuals discovered that the most effective way to communicate this message to the public is to share stories of those who have died in a manner that both informs and educates the public. Documentary films focused on death and dying stories that both inform and engage the viewer have the ability to greatly sway social constructs surrounding death and dying. Thus, the documentary, if done well, can be a powerful tool for helping people cope with the process of dying. By examining three death and dying documentaries, and isolating the techniques used by filmmakers to inform and engage the audience, I provide recommendations for making an effective death and dying documentary.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/garton/GartonK1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precession Damping in Itinerant Ferromagnets</field><field name="creator">Gilmore, Keith</field><field name="description">Precession damping in metallic ferromagnets had been assumed to result from the spinorbit interaction. While several theories of spin-orbit damping had been postulated, no convincing numerical comparisons to data existed. We selected one promising theory and performed first-principles numerical calculations of damping for bulk iron, cobalt, and nickel. Comparison of minimal calculated and measured damping rates demonstrated a 70 % agreement for nickel, 60 % for iron, and 40 % for cobalt. We then relaxed the initial constraint of a universal electron-lattice scattering rate by allowing the scattering rate to be spin dependent. The spin dependent lifetime ratio was equated to the ratio of the spin resolved density of states at the Fermi level. This modification improved the agreement to 95 % for nickel, 70 % for iron, and 47 % for cobalt. With this level of agreement, we next constructed a simple effective field explanation for the damping process. As the magnetization rotates, the energy of the spin system gets pushed out of equilibrium and this excitation is quenched by electron-lattice scattering. The energy of the spin system changes by two mechanism: the energies of the states change and transitions to excited states occur. The first mechanism had previously been described within the effective field picture as producing a breathing of the Fermi surface. As the magnetization precesses, the spin-orbit energy of each state changes leading to expansions and contractions of the Fermi surface that are periodic with the precession. To expand this metaphor, we have dubbed the second effect of transitions to excited states as a bubbling of the Fermi sea. In this picture, individual electrons across the Fermi surface undergo larger excitations. Finally, we investigated the dependence of the damping rate on the density of states and the spin-orbit coupling parameter. We found that the damping due to the breathing effect was roughly proportional to the density of states while damping from the bubbling terms correlated strongly with the density of states squared. By tuning the spin-orbit parameter we found that the breathing terms were proportional to the spin-orbit parameter cubed while the bubbling terms went as the spin-orbit parameter squared.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/gilmore/GilmoreK1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogen Transport and Capture in a Porous Media Biofilm Reactor</field><field name="creator">Grabinski, Kevin John</field><field name="description">Drinking water distribution systems pose the potential to transport biological and chemical contaminants to the consumers\' tap that can be responsible for widespread waterborne disease outbreaks (WBDO). A need exists to improve the ability to monitor contaminants that can attach to the distribution system\'s interior surfaces and to obtain samples for diagnosing both the cause of a WBDO and the extent of contamination within the system. In this study, a porous media reactor colonized with a mixed-species drinking water biofilm was used to study the capture of Salmonella typhimurium as a model pathogen. Parallel reactors were operated under constant flow (CF) and constant head (CH) to compare flow-regime induced spatial variations in biofilm accumulation and the resulting pathogen capture. Parallel test reactors were operated with 0.5 mg/L supplemental carbon until the accumulation of biofilm in the CH reactor reduced the flowrate to the target sampling point (CF flowrate). Both test reactors were then inoculated with slug doses of approximately 3x109 CFU S. typhimurium. Effluent water samples were collected for five pore-volumes, followed by the destructive sampling of the reactor. Plate counts were used to enumerate S. typhimurium present in effluent samples and captured within the reactor. Cell counts in effluent samples displayed an accelerated breakthrough compared with a non-reactive tracer. Compared with uncolonized control reactors (0.13%), colonized reactors (0.96%) captured significantly more cells. Despite spatial variations in biofilm accumulation, colonized CH and CF reactors captured comparable amounts of S. typhimurium. Increasing sampling duration to twenty pore volumes demonstrated greater retention of captured cells in the colonized reactors over the control reactors. S. typhimurium transport and capture was also observed in a 0.9 mm square flowcell packed with 100 mm beads using a confocal microscope. Interception and straining were responsible for capture on clean beads while biofilm accumulation narrowed pore throats sufficiently to allow for mechanical filtration to occur. This study demonstrates that using biofilm colonized porous media may be an effective tool to capture pathogens for monitoring drinking water distribution systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/grabinski/GrabinskiK0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GODANDER2MALS</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Daniel Adam</field><field name="description">As humans, we exist on the brink of solid matter (earth) and endless space (space) and are an incredibly small part of all that exists.

Natural history filmmaking has increasingly used techniques of fiction, drama and anthropomorphizing to represent the natural world in storytelling. This paper will examine the use of the nonverbal form of filmmaking as an alternative style that can be used to effectively document natural history using a more lyrical, poetic and often more thoughtful style. This work examines previous works in the non-verbal genre and discusses how this style compares with historically more traditional natural history films and why this alternative style is used for the thesis film. Additionally, works from the disciplines of geography and natural history writing are examined for relevance to the non-verbal natural history filmmaking genre.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/haywood/HaywoodK0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Solution to Sprawl Through Public Transportation</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, Shane Anthony</field><field name="description">Driving down the streets you call home, through the hills you would hike and sled as a kid, by the rivers and ponds you swam and fished in; you realize that every trip made is to a place that is less and less like home. Entire ranches have been subdivided. The mom and pop stores have been replaced by corporate chains. Asphalt has been laid, lanes have been added, streets have been punched, and bridges have been erected. The open space and privacy that everyone moved there for is dwindling; the American Dream is deteriorating. Is sprawl unavoidable due to the inevitable growth our society demands or can we live and grow more efficiently, more sustainably? The desire to achieve a better life has broken down our city walls and depleted our resources. "The growth of the world population will lead to a tremendous demand for space, not only for buildings but also for farmland and areas reserved for nature." Even highway systems can't seem to outpace suburbia. "Why has a higher standard of living somehow failed to result in a better quality of life?" A considerable amount of architecture and the majority of land planning revolves around the concept of the automobile. "Too many architects are becoming proponents of sprawl and the one-size-fits-all mentality that is strangling the earth." In rural Montana, people build where they can drive; if one cannot drive there, someone will cut a road or build a bridge. In urban Montana, zoning has tied people to their cars due to its demand that different uses be divided throughout a given city. "People say they do not want to live near where they work, but that they would like to work near where they live." What if we could uproot where people live, work, shop, exercise, and gather; rearrange their locations; then realign them in a community that enables a proficient life, with less pollution, traffic, stress, and resources used? Obviously, this isn't feasible due to cost and the chaos of displacement. This thesis is intended to analyze the way we live, build, and move from place to place while destroying the reason why we live where we do. This thesis will dissect transportation issues broadly in the United States and specific to the Missoula Valley and ultimately argue for the position of Missoula implementing a new model for the way it moves and grows. If realized, this process of rewiring will result in a series of incremental changes that have the ability to create a prototypical status for Missoula amongst other Montana and Northwestern cites that is unprecedented with regards to transportation as a solution to sprawl.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/jacobs/JacobsS0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeley Lake Montana.  Developing a Sustainable Community within a Grid-Dependent Town.</field><field name="creator">Jones, Justin Balog</field><field name="description">Within ten years, Seeley Lake will be modernized and receive public services such as sewer, full water treatment plants, and cable television. When these developments are implemented in Seeley, the town will grow quickly and without regard for the existing physical environment. The economics of place will change as well; property values and taxes will be inflated to unseen levels. This thesis proposes that a central portion of the small town be redeveloped as offgrid community catering to the existing and future working class of Seeley Lake. Focusing on ten existing blocks in the center of Seeley Lake, the restructuring of the current arrangement of homes and the utilities will help in the redevelopment of central Seeley Lake into a community. By selectively abstaining from the public infrastructure, the newly revived community would be able to achieve lower utility and monthly costs as well as affordable property values while benefiting from the increased business and economic growth of the town. Within this community, the proposed architectural language would allow for future growth and change. These adaptable units may be enlarged or altered through a flexible growth system which may allow an addition of bedrooms, family rooms, and at a larger scale, even a garage. This language would be implemented to support the working families and individual economic situations. With this typology the working class could remain within the evolving town, taking advantage of the growth, while not feeling repressed or alienated. These expandable homes would be designed to cater not only to working individuals but also to small families and the elderly.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/jones/JonesJ0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rural Women's Perceptions of the Diffusion of Technological Innovations that Increase Quality Shea Butter Productions in Mali</field><field name="creator">Kante, Assa</field><field name="description">An ethnographic case study was conducted in three villages in Mali (West Africa) to determine the perceptions of woman producers of shea butter toward the introduction of new technologies to save labor input in processing and improving quality of shea butter.

Perspective has long been a part of narrative film criticism, however, and it is essential to a complete examination of a film genre. I define perspective here as the cognitive view of the mind that commands the subject. In documentary and wildlife films, credibility is vital and the film's perspective or point of view establishes this through the use of the camera apparatus and narration. The very use of these tools of perspective may add to a scientific perspective, but inevitably prevent an objectively scientific representation, the pivot of a fact-driven, wildlife film. Although credibility is established by evidence and facts, a tendency toward anthropomorphism can jeopardize claims of objectivity and scientific credibility.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/kasic/KasicK0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employing Visitor Studies and Video Media to Better Communicate Science in National Parks</field><field name="creator">Koch, Alison Lindsey</field><field name="description">The future of the National Park Service depends upon the agency's ability to educate the public to care for and preserve America's parks. In order to achieve this, parks must provide accurate, up-to-date scientific and preservation management information to visitors so that they gain a greater appreciation of parks by understanding what they protect. Although the Park Service has gone to great lengths to ensure scientific information is utilized in all management decision-making, no management documents or Park Service programs currently provide practical guidance or are adequately equipped to directly address communicating accurate and up-to-date scientific and preservation information to those who hold the future of parks in their hands: the public. Demands placed upon interpreters, who are the park staff primarily responsible for front lines visitor communication and services, are such that science communication can get lost in an array of other informational needs. Researchers, resource management, and visitor service personnel must create avenues or maximize current strategies to cooperate more effectively to communicate park science and management. Contrary to interpretive trends in the National Park Service, social survey and visitor studies show that communicating scientific and preservation information to visitors at parks and other institutions is expected and well-received. One specific underutilized form of both employee to employee and park to visitor communication is that of video media. Video allows a platform for scientists to speak directly to visitors, train other park staff, and encourage continued divisional cooperation. It can also provide an effective archival media library of information. A filmmaker must forge through bureaucratic and institutional realities in order to achieve successful scientific communication, but the benefits are immense when this work is crucial to help sustain the future of "one of America's greatest ideas," the national parks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/koch/KochA0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Paradigm Shift for the Science Documentary</field><field name="creator">Kustusch, Christopher Michael</field><field name="description">The science documentary exists within a very specific cultural space. It is not only separate from conventional fictional entertainment but it is also separate from the mainstream, or social documentary, tradition. The cross-blending of genres and the borrowing of technique and style from current "modern documentaries" should lead to a radical reinvention of the paradigm (i.e., a paradigm shift) of the science/natural history documentary. This essay will focus on three main areas of discussion: the rise of the modern documentary, a discussion exploring the characteristics of the current paradigm of traditional science films, and a survey of those projects that move towards a hybrid of science and entertainment. In looking at these films, we will consider my thesis film, Oil Eye for the Average Guy, (2007), which attempts to construct the new science documentary paradigm by using "social documentary" techniques to reach a larger audience.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/kustusch/KustuschC0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Non-Autonomous Bursting Model for Neurons</field><field name="creator">Latulippe, Joe Jean-Marc</field><field name="description">Certain mammalian visual neurons exhibit On and Off responses when given a light stimulus. In addition to these responses, [51] showed that for retinal ganglion cells, the neuron will also exhibit a Mixed response when given two simultaneous stimuli in different regions of the cell's receptive field. This Mixed response is a nonlinear combination of the On and Off responses. In this dissertation, a single cell model which can reproduce On, Off, and Mixed responses is developed and examined using leading order analyses and averaging. This model is developed from a current balance equation which includes a non-autonomous input I(t), and consists of three coupled, first-order nonlinear differential equations which describe the dynamics of the membrane potential of the cell. When I(t) is assumed to be a constant current pulse, the On and Off responses can be reproduced but will depend on both the duration and the amplitude of the input. When I(t) is assumed to be monotone slowly decreasing, the model can reproduce the nonlinear properties for two simultaneous stimuli. In this dissertation, conditions which will guarantee each type of response will be found using the different subsystems of the model.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/latulippe/LatulippeJ0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuromuscular Performance and the Menstrual Cycle</field><field name="creator">Lemke, Shayna Marie</field><field name="description">Women athletes are more likely to tear their anterior cruciate ligament than their male counterparts. The female athlete has a complex system of steroid hormones that are continually changing. These sex hormones that fluctuate throughout each month may influence knee injuries, specifically the anterior cruciate ligament. The increased incidence in women is thought to be multifactorial, a combination of structural, anatomical, or biomechanical factors. The NCAA has reported that 75 percent of anterior cruciate ligament injuries are non-contact in competitive jumping or pivoting sports. In this study, the effects of the menstrual cycle on neuromuscular performance were investigated. Fifteen healthy females with regular menstrual cycles completed the various tests of this study for three phases of the menstrual cycle. All females were categorized as moderate or vigorous exercisers from an activity questionnaire. This study used a repeated measures experimental design; therefore, each participant served as her own control. The participants completed a series of two tests, including functional balance and fatigability. Each series was completed during three different phases of the menstrual cycle: menstruation, follicular and luteal. The participants used ovulation kits to predict the luteal phase. These phases were then verified through blood tests at each exercise session. The reaction time and balance test was performed with a BOSU wobble board placed on a force plate. A force platform was utilized to collect center of pressure data from the wobble board. The fatigue test protocol consisted of the participants performing in a pre-fatigue functional test, fatigue protocol and post-fatigue functional ability test. The functional test protocol consisted of two trials of four single-legged hop drills. It was hypothesized that all of the functional tests would have the greatest neuromuscular performance during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and for all of the tests to have differences between the pre- and post-fatigue trials. However, there were no significant differences in the functional tests over the menstrual cycle. There were differences in fatigue in the forward hop and figure eight tests, but the affect of fatigue on performance did not differ across menstrual cycle phases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/lemke/LemkeS0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Power and Potential of Performative Documentary Film</field><field name="creator">Little, John Arthur</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I argue the performative mode of documentary filmmaking is an emerging, intrinsically powerful and virtually unexplored weapon in the arsenal of science documentary. Through selected theoretical and academic writings, I examine origins and pathways of documentary film that ultimately lead to the performative documentary. I contrast the performative mode against a common paradigm that documentary, and particularly science documentary, demands a filmic text that embraces traditional conventions of narrative, realism, empiricism, causality and evidentiary truth claims. I then analyze the utility and application of common elements in performative documentary films including my performative science documentary, At the Risk of Being Smote. I show that viewers are uniquely able to assemble their own meaning from an adiachronistic structure of associated but fragmentary filmic events. Each person's mind weaves together patches of representation, fictive or not, into a tapestry of aesthetic response of knowledge and rhetorical truth. After discussing the current state of performative filmmaking tools and techniques, I look into the future of performative science documentary. Based on evolving trends and technologies, it is possible that audiences will not just view films, but rather participate in a multi-sensory experience. I conclude that performative science documentary is an immensely powerful, emerging tool that allows the viewer to perceive personal authorial control and voice that allows the boundary between discourse and intuition, between fiction and 'reality' to dissolve. Ultimately, this approach takes the filmmaker out of the role of interlocutor, giving the viewers a sense of invisible omniscience as they experience the filmic panopticon.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/little/LittleJ0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Place of Story and the Story of Place:  How the Convergence of Text and Image Marks the Opening of a New Literary Frontier</field><field name="creator">Lynn, Marie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">While certain scholars are lamenting that literature has become less relevant in these postmodern times, I have found that this is not at all the case.

In an attempt to reverse this trend, beaver (Castor canadensis) were reintroduced in Eagle Creek in 1991. Beaver promote aspen suckering through their dam and lodge building activities. In 2005, I assessed the long-term effects of beaver on aspen stands and the associated riparian area in the Eagle Creek Drainage. Aerial photographs taken in 1990 and 2005 were used to compare changes in riparian area vegetation where beaver were reintroduced. Aspen canopy cover decreased (P&lt;0.05) from 43% to 25% on Eagle Creek (29 ha) between 1990 and 2005. Willow (Salix spp.) cover increased (P&lt;0.05) from 10% to 14% and alder (Alnus incana) cover and water surface area doubled during the same period. Aspen recovery was estimated by comparing vegetative changes among control sites with &lt;10% beaver use (n = 5), active beaver sites (n = 6), sites abandoned for 1-3 years (n = 7), sites abandoned for 4-6 years (n = 4), and sites abandoned for 7-11 years (n = 5). Thirty, 1-m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; plots were used to determine aspen density and one 60-m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; belt transect was used to calculate size-class distributions at each site. Aspen stem densities in active sites and sites abandoned by beaver for 1-3 years were similar (2.6/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;) and increased (P=0.01) compared to all other sites (1/m&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2;). In addition, sprout and sapling densities were greater (P=0.01) in these sampling areas. However, aspen suckers were not able to grow taller than 2m on sites absent of beaver for 4-11 years, which prevented aspen recovery. Ungulate herbivory on aspen was assessed by comparing differences in 14 fenced (3 x 3m) and unfenced (3 x 3m) areas over 2 growing seasons. Growth rate of aspen suckers was greater (P=0.001) in fenced areas (32cm/year) compared to unfenced areas (0.25cm/year) due to ungulate herbivory. Total ungulate density for Eagle Creek was equivalent to 17.6 elk/km&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; in the winter of 2005-06.

The novelty preference test is a direct measure of memory function and has been used in the rat and primate animal models. The gerbil animal model has been used extensively to study the mechanism of ischemic brain damage; however, the novelty preference paradigm has not been used to study memory impairment in this species. In addition, the novelty preference paradigm has not been tested with models of ischemia. In the present experiment, Mongolian gerbils were tested in two different types of novelty-preference tasks (Object and Arrangement) following either ischemic insult or a sham control surgery. There was no significant difference in preference for novel objects between ischemic and sham groups. However, ischemic gerbils showed a significant decrease in preference for novel arrangements relative to shams. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated the dissociation between object and arrangement memory using rats and primates. The results of the present study indicate that the novelty preference paradigm can be successfully used with the gerbil model for ischemic brain damage to study memory impairment and neuroprotective agents.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/mcneill/McNeillD0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geochemical evidence for microbially mediated subglacial mineral weathering</field><field name="creator">Montross, Scott Norman</field><field name="description">Interactions between dilute meltwater and fine-grained, freshly comminuted debris at the bed of temperate glaciers liberate significant solute. The proportions of solute produced in the subglacial environment via biotic and abiotic processes remains unknown, however, this work suggests the biotic contribution is substantial. Laboratory analyses of microbiological and geochemical properties of sediment and meltwater from the Haut Glacier d\'Arolla (HGA) indicates that a metabolically active microbial community exists in water-saturated sediments at the ice-bedrock interface. Basal sediment slurries and meltwater were incubated in the laboratory for 100 days under near in situ subglacial conditions. Relative proportions of solute produced via abiotic v. biotic mineral weathering were analyzed by comparing the evolved aqueous chemistry of biologically active (live) sediment slurries with sterilized controls. Aqueous chemical analyses indicate an increase in solute produced from mineral weathering coupled with nitrate depletion in the biologically active slurries compared with the killed controls. These results infer that microbial activity at HGA is likely an important contributor to chemical weathering associated solute fluxes from the glaciated catchment. Due to the magnitude of past glaciations throughout geologic time (e.g., Neoproterozoic and Late-Pleistocene), and evidence that subglacial microbial activity impacts mineral weathering, greater consideration needs to be given to cold temperature biogeochemical weathering and its impact on global geochemical cycles.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/montross/MontrossS0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatiotemporal Variation of Fish Assemblages in Montana Prarie Streams</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Jason Alan</field><field name="description">Fisheries biologists must be certain that their samples represent true parameters to make sound management decisions. A large-scale effort was conducted in the past decade to sample Montana prairie stream fish assemblages. This effort focused on sampling as many streams as possible, mostly during summer. Longitudinal sampling within drainages and replication of sites across time was minimal. Consequently, the spatiotemporal variation of prairie stream fish assemblages in Montana is not well understood. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine the influence of spatial, temporal, and abiotic variables in structuring prairie stream fish assemblages and 2) determine the survey design that best characterizes prairie stream fish assemblages. To assess spatiotemporal variation, lower, middle, and upper sites were sampled on five tributaries of the Yellowstone River during each season over a two-year period. Spatial position explained the greatest amount of variation (18.5%), followed by proportion of fine substrates (13.9%). Season (i.e., temporal variation) was not significant in explaining the overall variation in the fish assemblage. Fish species were associated with lower, middle, and upper spatial positions and along the fine substrates gradient based on abundance by species. A more detailed spatial analysis of fish assemblage variation was conducted by sampling sites arrayed from the confluence to the headwaters on each of the five streams during June and July 2005 and 2006. Species richness varied longitudinally and decreased from downstream to upstream sites. Proportion of fine substrates increased and pool area decreased from downstream to upstream sites. Longitudinal changes in species richness were often associated with longitudinal changes in the proportion of fine substrates. Large river fishes were limited to lower and middle reaches and were only occasionally found in upper reaches. Spatiotemporal and longitudinal findings were consistent among streams of varying watershed sizes. At least lower, middle, and upper sites are required to adequately characterize the fish assemblages of prairie streams and more samples are needed at lower sites than middle or upper sites. Given logistic and monetary constraints, biologists should design their surveys to maximize spatial coverage to adequately characterize fish assemblages of prairie streams.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/mullen/MullenJ1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sleeping with the Enemy: Integrating Big-Box Retail with Existing Communities</field><field name="creator">Nash, Ronald James</field><field name="description">The intent of my thesis is to find a way to integrate a large big-box retailer into a community in such a way that it benefits the community as a whole. This must be accomplished within the parameters that mark the store as a viable option for the parent company as well. This ideal must be approached from the philosophy that box stores are a large part of the current American way of life and to let them grow unchecked will signal the inevitable death of downtown retail districts as more and more business gets sucked to the super-stores and the areas immediately surrounding them. To do this we will need to find what benefits a box-store can add to a community and further research and rethink the typically negative aspects of these retail giants to find a way to incorporate them into our downtown shopping districts, without destroying their original feel. With this thesis, it is my intent to create a viable model that allows box stores to act as anchors and catalysts for a downtown area (either existing or built) rather than its death knell. To do this I will be rethinking a number of design strategies with the seamless integration of community and big-box retail in mind. To this end, I will not be acting to simply find a way to add a box-store and its typical trappings to the end of historic downtown street, but rather to find away to integrate a set of large box stores into a downtown community in such a way that benefits the citizens of that community on every designable level. I will be challenging not only the typical design strategies of a box store, but those of a typical downtown community as well. Seven major design strategies will be looked at during this project, they are: 1. Design for a diversity of use and users 2. Design a safe and secure streetscape that will encourage use. 3. Design a streetscape that accommodates pedestrians as equals with vehicle traffic. 4. Design a destination, not just a path. 5. Design it well. 6. Balance supply with demand. 7. Use aesthetics as an integration tool. With these design strategies, a box store can become an integral part of a downtown community ... or at least a much better alternative to the rampant sprawl that occurs with their current implementation strategy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/nash/NashR0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variability in soil CO2 production and surface CO2 efflux across riparian-hillslope transitions</field><field name="creator">Pacific, Vincent Jerald</field><field name="description">The spatial and temporal controls on soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; production and surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux have been identified as an outstanding gap in our understanding of carbon cycling. I investigated both the spatial and temporal variability of soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentrations and surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux across eight topographically distinct riparian-hillslope transitions in the ~300 ha subalpine upper-Stringer Creek Watershed in the Little Belt Mountains, Montana. Riparian-hillslope transitions provide ideal locations for investigating the spatial and temporal controls on soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentrations and surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux due to strong gradients in respiration driving factors, including soil water content, soil temperature, and soil organic matter. I collected high frequency measurements of soil temperature, soil water content, soil air CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentrations (20 cm and 50 cm), surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux, and soil C and N concentrations (once) at 32 locations along four transects. Soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentrations were more variable in riparian landscape positions, as compared to hillslope positions, as well as along transects with greater upslope accumulated area. This can be attributed to a greater range of soil water content and higher soil organic matter availability. Soil gas diffusion also differed between riparian and hillslope positions. Soil gas transport limited surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux in riparian landscape positions due to high soil water content (despite strong concentration gradients), while efflux was gradient (production) limited in hillslope positions. This led to spring-fall reversal of maximum riparian and hillslope soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentrations, with highest hillslope concentrations near peak snowmelt and highest riparian concentrations during the late summer and early fall. Soil temperature was a dominant control on the overall temporal variability of soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218;. However, soil water content controlled differences in the timing of soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentration peaks within and between riparian and hillslope positions, as exemplified by those locations closest to Stringer Creek (wetter landscape positions) peaking up to three months later than those riparian locations near the riparian-hillslope transition. This work suggests that one control on the spatial and temporal variability of watershed soil CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; concentrations and surface CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; efflux is a soil water content mediated tradeoff between CO&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#8218; production and transport.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/pacific/PacificV0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive Subversion: Franchised City vs. Found-Object Adaptability: A Media Beacon / Public Dialog Venue in an Abandoned Grain Elevator</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Megan Ruth</field><field name="description">Public space has been integral to city planning since Ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Greek and Roman governmental structures were based on the idea of people coming together to discuss. The senators were the main speakers in the Forum, but the citizens would gather to listen or contribute. The architecture of this kind of public space was large, open, and able to accommodate everyone willing to attend. Both the Agora in Athens and the Forum in Rome included marketplaces and other public amenities which drew people to the public arena.&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup1; During Ancient Times, public gatherings were the only form of passing on information. Human contact and interaction was necessary, and people gained a civic sense from the live interaction and involvement with their fellow citizens. Everything was live, including entertainment. Live encounters were the media. In Contemporary American Culture, it is not necessary to have live dialog. Communication can be carried across various media, some of which include simultaneous audiovisual conversations. Public space and a civic sense has been lost to electronic media, and shopping space is the remaining public space.&amp;Acirc;&amp;sup2; Just as the marketplace drew people to the Agora and the Forum, shopping centers today draw people from their homes to common locations. The intent of this thesis is to explore design opportunities that would proactively address contemporary consumer culture. This passive consumer culture has eroded the "civic sense" of the past, and architecture can restore the "civic sense" by structuring opportunities for interaction between people that would not otherwise exist. This thesis will investigate the current situation in American culture, and research ways in which architecture can provide an intermediate venue between the public sense of the past (before electronic media) and the world of consumerism, convenience, and burgeoning technology. The power and efficiency of electronic media makes it a nearly irresistible cultural magnet. It simulates reality and can be combined with the intensity of live dialog and encounters to create a hybrid that will enhance contemporary culture.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/quinn/QuinnM0507.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Incubation of Intuitive Mitigation</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Christopher Cole</field><field name="description">The sound of fingers tapping against stone resonates through the quiet coffee shop as local help bangs, stirs, and presents a double tall frothed mocha. The customer grabs the large cup of caffeine as though shot out of a cannon screaming toward the door barely hesitating at the brass handle, and in an instant is in a conversation with an executive across the country. Culture today seems to act in a similar fashion to the "Flash" coffee consumer. We should wonder what might have happened had the consumer stopped to enjoy the moment, maybe participated in a balancing game while walking across the tile floor. Perhaps sentient memories would conjure up past childhood experiences that inevitably would turn the corners of the mouth up into a half smile? Instead, the rigorous life we all live in today has taken hold. With the importance of time weighing on the mind, and the latest technology calling for attention out from our coat pockets, no wonder for the rush! It is not just time and technology that cause us to act this way. In this rush the consumer has also overlooked the changing patterns of life that occur during each season. For example, without even acknowledging an innate awareness for change, drink ordering went from iced to warm with a particularly cold fall day. Changes are occurring rapidly, yet some of us still are not aware. We should be aware current trends in music , film, and "texting" are changing our culture.. Also, an overabundance of access to information adds another dimension by speeding up the rate at which each change occurs. While we accelerate through our lives using tooling technologies like cell phones, and computers, and information becomes over abundant, a growing disconnection is occurring between the engagement of our internal intuitions and the external environment.

Control of the number of branching units during synthesis results in monodisperse macromolecules with a specified, but variable, number of terminal branches, to which various functionalities can be attached. The ability to attach large numbers of functional groups, in controlled ratios, to the dendrimer end-groups makes dendrimers attractive templates for a variety of applications. For example, partially glycosylated dendrimers are being explored as multivalent ligands for inhibitory and targeting purposes. In such applications the spatial distribution of functional groups on the dendrimers must be understood. Analytical studies aimed at elucidating the structure and dynamics of dendrimers have, to date, been very limited. In this dissertation, a spin-label electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) approach is developed and applied to solve this problem. The functionalization of dendrimers with TEMPO spin-labels in varying degrees of loading is described. Trends in the dipolar line-broadening of the EPR spectra in frozen solutions and spin exchange controlled lineshapes in fluid solutions are compared to structural models. New computational techniques are developed for interpreting spin-spin broadening in these complex molecular systems containing many spin-labels. The distribution of functional groups was found to be random for all cases tested, and the dimensionality of the space occupied by spin-labels was dependent on dendrimer size. Analysis of spin-spin broadening in the fluid solution for samples with less than full spin-label loading required the inherent heterogeneity of the spin environments to be explicitly taken into account.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/sebby/SebbyK1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Statistical Methods for Analyzing Proteomics Data from Affinity Isolation LC-MS/MS Experiments</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Julia Lynn</field><field name="description">The field of proteomics is exploding with statistical problems waiting to be explored. To obtain information on protein complexes, interactions between protein pairs is initially examined. This exploration is performed using `bait-prey' protein pull-down assays that use a protein affinity agent and an LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry)-based protein identifcation method. An experiment generates a protein association matrix wherein each column represents a sample from one bait protein, each row represents one prey protein and each cell contains a presence/absence association indicator. The prey protein presence/absence pattern is assessed with a Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) and simulated LRT p-values. Fisher's Exact Test and a conditional frequency distribution test using generating functions are also used to assess the prey protein observation pattern. Based on the p-value, each prey protein is assigned a category (Specific or Non-Specific) and appraised with respect to the goal and design of the experiment. The Bayes' Odds is calculated for each prey-bait pair in the `Specific' category to estimate the posterior probability that two proteins interact and compared to an approach used by Gilchrist et al. [23]. The method is illustrated using an experiment investigating protein complexes of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 at the Proteomics Facility of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The example analysis shows the results to be biologically sensible and more realistic than methods previously used to infer protein - protein associations. While inferring protein-protein associations is of great importance in proteomic studies, the quality of the data is of equal or greater importance. Protein-protein interactions may be inferred incorrectly or not at all depending on the quality of the data. Prior to this thesis, statistical quality control measures have not been incorporated into these experiments. The implementation of traditional Individual/Moving Range (IMR) charts and cumulative sum (cusum) quality control methods for use with pull-down experiment data is studied. These methodologies are illustrated using a standard protein mixture from PNNL. The joint application of IMR and cusum charts promises to provide researchers with information on changes in the mean and variability of the data resulting from control samples run through the mass spectrometer process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/sharp/SharpJ0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spacing and Lag Effects in Recognition Memory: Time Versus Intervening Items</field><field name="creator">Shively, Matthew David</field><field name="description">Spacing and lag effects both refer to abundant findings that memory is enhanced when repeated items are spaced.

It is time to look at the underlying definitions of the genre from a different perspective and determine whether the current standards are the best way to successfully convey messages about science to the widest audience. To explore the possibilities for increasing the effectiveness of science filmmaking, one needs to look at the basic assumptions that come into play during the process of producing science films by re-framing the major components of the science film: goals, subject matter, audience, and format.

Fluvial grayling were thought to be restricted to the Big Hole River, Montana, where abundances were declining. Although fluvial grayling of the lower Gibbon River, Yellowstone National Park (YNP) were considered extirpated by 1935, anglers frequently reported catching grayling throughout the river since 1980. My goal was to determine if a viable population of fluvial grayling persisted in the Gibbon River, or if fish caught in the river were downstream emigrants from lacustrine populations in headwater lakes. I developed three objectives to address this goal: 1) determine grayling abundances in the Gibbon River, 2) determine the source of grayling in the Gibbon River detected downstream of headwater lakes (occupied by lacustrine populations), and 3) determine if grayling are successfully spawning in the Gibbon River. In 2005 and 2006, estimated abundances ranged from 0 to 95 and 0 to 109, respectively. Larger estimated abundances resulted when the Chapman modification was incorporated into electrofishing estimates, increasing ranges to vary from 0 to 421 and 0 to 506 in 2005 and 2006, respectively. However, both methods of estimation were accompanied by large standard errors reflecting the few grayling detected in the river. Relatively few grayling were caught by anglers in comparison to other systems. Genetic analyses indicated that grayling from throughout the Gibbon system likely belonged to the same population, most notably supported by very low genetic differentiation (FST = 0.0021 &amp;Acirc;&amp;plusmn; 0.002) between headwater lake and river fish. Lengths at most ages were similar among all Gibbon system fish and successful river spawning was not documented below Little Gibbon Falls (the first barrier to upstream movement downstream of headwater lakes). Few grayling adults and no fry were detected in the Gibbon River, implying that a reproducing fluvial population does not likely exist. These findings may affect future ESA considerations of fluvial grayling while providing data for management within and outside of YNP.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/steed/SteedA1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nest-Site Selection and Nest Survival of Two Woodpecker Species in Ponderosa-Pine Dominated Forests</field><field name="creator">Story, Scott Joseph</field><field name="description">Management of woodpecker populations requires knowledge of nesting habitat and vital rates in different forest conditions. We examined nest-site selection and nest survival for two woodpeckers, northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) and hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus) at three locations in ponderosa-pine forests of the interior Columbia River Basin. Our goals were to: (1) characterize the range of habitat conditions available to nesting woodpeckers in our study area; (2) determine which habitat features best discriminated between nest and non-nest plots, and (3) establish which habitat features most influenced daily nest survival. Northern flickers and hairy woodpeckers were more likely to choose snags than live trees. Both species used larger diameter snags than those available at random. Nest snags tended to be in plots that had higher snag densities and lower live tree densities. For northern flickers, a model of constant daily survival received more support than any model containing habitat covariates. Daily nest survival from the best model for northern flickers was estimated to be 0.55 (95% CI: 0.46-0.64). Increasing live tree density and coarse woody debris volume were included in the most well supported model for hairy woodpeckers. Results from this study did not provide support for the "nest-quality" hypothesis. Nest survival for woodpeckers in this study was low, especially at the Idaho location; we hypothesize that this could be because of differences in predator abundance among the three locations. In ponderosa pine forests that have not been recently disturbed, we recommend maintaining clumps of snags, especially those that contain large snags. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms that dictate woodpecker nest survival in ponderosa pine forests.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/story/StoryS1207.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships Among Geochemical Processes and Microbial Community Structure in a Unique High-Arsenic, Sulfidic Geothermal Spring in Yellowstone National Park</field><field name="creator">Taylor, William Jr.</field><field name="description">The metabolisms of chemotrophic microorganisms are linked with the geochemical transformation of redox-active chemical species and mineral precipitation-dissolution reactions in geothermal environments. The objectives of the current work were to correlate the spatial distribution of microbial populations with changes in aqueous geochemistry and mineralogy in a unique Yellowstone National Park (YNP) geothermal spring, and to cultivate thermophilic microorganisms with phylogenetic and metabolic relevance to spring conditions. The geothermal spring (hereafter referenced as Joseph's Coat Spring -JC3) contains the highest reported concentrations of arsenic, antimony and thiosulfate of any geothermal feature studied in YNP. A suite of analytical and molecular approaches including aqueous geochemical and dissolved gas analysis, solid phase characterization, energetic calculations, microscopy and 16S rRNA gene sequence distribution were utilized to correlate specific microbial populations with biogeochemical processes. Predominant geochemical changes observed within the outflow channel were disappearance of methane, dissolved sulfide and ingassing of dissolved oxygen. Oxidation of arsenite was significant within the outflow channel despite the slow ingassing rates of dissolved oxygen. Microbial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined at locations in the source pool and within the outflow channel. Shifts in microbial community structure were observed as a function of distance from the source. Source pool pyritic phases and Sb and S rich sediments were dominated by Geothermobacterium, Desulfurococcus, and Thermofilum-like sequences. Shifts in microbial community structure were observed within the outflow channel including appearance of Aquificales and Thermales sequences down gradient. Cultivation strategies based on spring geochemistry and energetic analysis were successful in isolating two novel thermophilic Crenarchaeota with high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to those determined within the spring sediments. An anaerobic, heterotrophic, S-respiring Thermofilum-like strain (WP28t) exhibits characteristics consistent with spring geochemistry, and confirms the importance of microbial reduction of elemental S in this spring. Detailed geochemical characterization and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences will continue to guide cultivation strategies for isolating novel microorganisms. This research indicates the importance of correlating microbial community analysis with geochemical measurements as an integrated approach for understanding the primary carbon and energy sources that link microbial populations with specific geochemical processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/taylor/TaylorW0807.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Puroidoline A and B upon Grain Endosperm Texture, End-Use Quality Traits and Physicochemical Association of Starch in Wheat</field><field name="creator">Wanjugi, Humphrey Wainaina</field><field name="description">Endosperm texture in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is controlled by the Pina and Pinb genes that together comprise the Hardness (Ha) locus, and is an important criterion affecting end-product quality. The Ha encodes friabilin, a 15 kD protein primarily composed of Puroindoline A (PINA) and Puroindoline B (PINB). Both PINA and PINB interact with starch leading to a soft endosperm, but the physicochemical mechanism controlling endosperm texture is not clearly understood. Here, I isolated the role of PINA and PINB individually and in combination upon grain hardness, milling and bread baking traits. I also determined the effect of overexpressing PINA or PINB on starch bound polar lipids and PIN cellular localization. F&amp;acirc;&#8218;&#402; recombinants homozygous for either the Pina or Pinb null Ha locus with or lacking a transgenically added Pina or Pinb were analyzed for grain hardness, PIN abundance, milling and baking traits, and levels of starch and flour polar lipids. Addition of Pina to the Pinb null Ha locus or Pinb to the Pina null Ha locus resulted in intermediate texture. Genotypes with added Pina to Pina null Ha locus and Pinb to Pinb null Ha locus were soft textured and had low flour yield, ash, small flour particles sizes, and increased PIN and polar lipid levels on starch. PINs localized to the starch granule surface in the presence or absence of the other protein but addition of Pinb to Pina null Ha locus resulted in more PINB associated to starch, increased affinity to bound polar lipids and greater negative effects on baking traits than addition of PINA. Results indicate that overexpression of PINs leads to reduced grain hardness, modified flour milling properties, negatively effects baking traits, and increased starch bound polar lipids. Further, PINA or PINB can act and localize to starch independently of the other protein leading to intermediate texture but soft texture requires both PINA and PINB but, PINB associates more with polar lipids on starch surface and negatively affect baking traits than PINA. My study shows that polar lipids mediate puroindolines association to starch and this mediation can influence endosperm texture, milling, and baking traits.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://etd.lib.montana.edu/etd/2007/wanjugi/WanjugiH0507.pdf</field></doc></add>
