The thesis is divided into two parts, in which the ship is considered to be moving in water of constant depth and non-constant depth respectively. In both parts, results are given for ships in channels and in open water.  Since squat is essentially a Bernoulli effect, viscosity is neglected throughout most of the work, which results in a boundary value problem involving Laplace's equation. Only qualitative statements about the effect of viscosity are made.  For a ship moving in water of constant depth, we first consider a one-dimensional theory for narrow channels. This is described for both linearized flow, where the disturbance due to the ship is small, and nonlinear flow, where the disturbance due to the ship is large. For nonlinear flow we develop an iterative method for determining the nonlinear sinkage and trim. Conditions for the existence of steady flow are determined, which take into account the squat of the ship.  We then turn to the problem of ships moving in open water, where one-dimensional theory is no longer applicable. A well-known slender-body shallow-water theory is modified to remove the singularity which occurs when the ship's speed is equal to the shallow-water wave speed. This is done by including the effect of dispersion, in a manner similar to the derivation of the Korteweg-deVries equation. A finite-depth theory is also used to model the flow near the critical speed.  For a ship moving in water of non-uniform depth, a linearized one-dimensional theory is derived which is applicable to unsteady flow. This is applied to simple bottom topographies, using analytic as well as numerical methods. A corresponding slender-body shallow-water theory for variable depth is also developed, which is valid for ships in channels or open water. Numerical results are given for a step depth change, and an analytic solution to the problem is discussed.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">squat, ship, shallow water</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterization of the CP2-related transcription factor, CRTR-1.</field><field name="creator">To, Sarah</field><field name="description">CRTR-1 is a member of the CP2 family of transcription factors. Unlike other CP2 family members, CRTR-1 expression is regulated developmentally. Major sites of expression in the embryo include the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation blastocyst and the developing kidney. It is also expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are derived from the ICM of blastocysts, and is downregulated as these cells differentiate into early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells. This expression pattern suggests that CRTR-1 plays a role in early pluripotent populations. This thesis aims to characterize the transcription factor CRTR-1 at the molecular level and analyses the role of sumoylation on CRTR-1 function to develop a better understanding of the molecular role of CRTR-1 in ES cells. Luciferase reporter assays show that CRTR-1 is able to regulate the activities of other CP2 family members: CP2, NF2d9 and altNF2d9. It enhances CP2- and NF2d9-mediated activation but suppresses altNF2d9-mediated activation. To map the functional domains in the CRTR-1 protein, transactivation studies using CRTR-1 deletion mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and a GAL4-responsive reporter system were performed. These studies map repressor activity to amino acids 48-200, but fail to identify a transactivation domain within the CRTR-1 protein. In order to understand the mechanisms by which CRTR-1 regulates the transcriptional activities of CP2 family members, a number of approaches are taken, including co-immunoprecipitation to show that CRTR-1 interacts with other CP2-like proteins, EMSA which demonstrate that CRTR-1 forms DNA binding complexes with CP2 family members, and subcellular protein localisation studies which reveal the ability of CRTR-1 and other family members to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm via a CRM1-dependent pathway. In addition, the subcellular localisation of CRTR-1 appears to be cell type specific, with an exclusively nuclear localisation pattern in ES cells, a predominantly cytoplasmic localisation pattern in HEK293T cells, and a cytoplasmic and nuclear speckle localisation pattern in COS-1 cells. Co-expression of CRTR-1 with CP2 or NF2d9 results in the re-localisation of CRTR-1 to the cytoplasm in ES cells. The sumoylation enzymes Ubc9 and PIAS1 have previously been identified as CP2-interacting proteins (Kang et al., 2005a). Given the identification of two potential sumoylation sites within CRTR-1, FK&#179;&#8304; QE and LK&#8308;&#8310; &#8308;AE, and the ability for sumoylation to regulate transcription factor function, the possibility that CRTR-1 is regulated by sumoylation is investigated in this thesis. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that CRTR-1 is modified by SUMO-1 and that lysine 30 is the critical residue for this modification. Mutation of lysine 30 to alanine, which abolishes CRTR-1 sumoylation, results in enhancement of transactivation by CRTR-1, suggesting that sumoylation of CRTR-1 blocks maximal activation. Unexpectedly, however, overexpression of Ubc9, PIAS1, or SUMO-1 results in enhancement of CRTR-1 transcriptional activity, indicating that a more complex mechanism of regulation of CRTR-1 activity is likely. This thesis presents several novel properties of CRTR-1 and other CP2 family members, including the ability of CRTR-1, previously characterized as a repressor, to activate transcription. It is also the first demonstration that CP2 proteins are regulated by sumoylation and that they shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm via a CRM1-dependent mechanism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CP2 transcription factors; sumoylation; embryonic stem cells</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae and Phoma terrestris on onion (Allium cepa) in the Mid Murray region of South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Yvonne J.</field><field name="description">Two fungi that cause disease on onion in the Mid Murray region of South Australia were investigated. These were Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, the cause of damping off of seedlings, wilting in the field, and basal rot in storage, and Phoma terrestris, which causes pink root. The aim of the study was to investigate resistant or tolerant cultivars and crop rotations as possible management strategies for these diseases. Several Fusarium spp. were isolated from onion roots and bulbs in the field, onion bulbs in storage, soil, and onion seed. All isolates were tested for pathogenicity by various means, however, none caused disease and therefore could not be identified conclusively as F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae. As a result research on Fusarium was discontinued. Pink discolouration was detected on onion roots in commercial crops at Bowhill, South Australia, and isolation of P. terrestris from roots was attempted. Several published and novel methods were employed with variable success. Only one of the published methods yielded P. terrestris, but results were inconsistent. Two methods developed in this study permitted isolation of P. terrestris. In both cases, infested plant material was incubated on wheat straw agar (WSA), which turns pink in the presence of P. terrestris. One method involved soaking surface sterilised pink-pigmented wheat straw in solution, at approximately 24&#186;C for 2 days, and then spreading 1 ml of the resulting suspension on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA) and incubating for a further 7 to 10 days. The second method involved dispensing warm sterile water into a plate of pink-pigmented WSA, agitating the plate, and spreading 1 ml aliquots onto APDA, and incubating for 7 to 10 days. One isolate of P. terrestris, shown to be pathogenic to onion was used in subsequent experiments. Several brown onion cultivars commonly grown in the Mid Murray region of South Australia, or marketed as tolerant to pink root, were examined for susceptibility to infection by P. terrestris. Seven cultivars were tested in vitro, and seedlings of eight cultivars were grown in a greenhouse for 4 months in soil naturally infested with P. terrestris. Selected cultivars were also evaluated in the field. Of the cultivars tested, none was significantly less susceptible to infection by P. terrestris than any other as indicated by pink pigment on WSA. Cereals such as wheat, oat and barley, as well as lucerne and canola, are grown in rotation with onion to provide ground cover, to minimise soil erosion and reduce inoculum of pathogens between onion crops. As the susceptibility of these rotation crops to P. terrestris was not known, several were tested in the field and in the greenhouse for their ability to act as hosts for P.  terrestris. Likewise, the potential of weeds commonly found in onion fields to act as hosts of P. terrestris was investigated. Less P. terrestris was detected in the roots of plants of oat cultivars Marloo and Swan, as well as barley cultivars Galleon and Schooner than of most other crops tested and, thus, these cvs were considered less likely to act as hosts of P. terrestris. Weeds such as Brassica tournefortii, Portulaca oleracea and Oxalis pes-caprae collected from the field were infected by P. terrestris, whereas P. terrestris was not detected in the roots of Chenopodium album. In summary, new methods for isolation of P. terrestris were identified and may, with further development, aid in research on pink root. The onion cultivars tested in this study did not differ in susceptibility to pink root, but more cultivars should be tested. P. terrestris infected a range of other crops and weeds, and it is recommended that further work is conducted in this area to facilitate cultural management of onion crops to minimise build up of inoculum in the soil.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">onions; fusarium; phoma; pink root</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A second chance: an investigation into adult re-entry education in the South Australian public secondary school system 1989-2005.</field><field name="creator">Lancione, Ascenzo</field><field name="description">Over the 1980s secondary schools and Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges in South Australia had increasing numbers of adults returning to formal secondary education mainly in search of better jobs or to qualify for tertiary studies. The teaching of such students required an appreciation of the difficulties they faced with the competing demands of family and work, and the anxieties they had in meeting the requirements of formalised study. In 1989 the South Australian Government made a policy decision, to transfer all the year 11 and 12 classes which TAFE colleges had specially established for adult students to the public secondary school system. Funds were allocated for the establishment of a secondary school system wide structure of nine Adult Re-entry sites, eight of which are still successfully operating within the Department of Education and Children&#8217;s Services. Whilst adult educational sites existed elsewhere, no other Australian state had a comparable systemic secondary school structure designed for adults returning to study. As a teacher of adult re-entry students, I sought to investigate the historical factors behind the policy decision to establish of adult re-entry sites within the secondary school system, to research the development of adult programs at a particular site and to study the experiences of adult students, analysing in particular why they returned to formal studies. Overseas studies indicated that to understand the personal worlds of adult students two sets of factors needed to be taken into account. External social and cultural factors influenced their current situation and their life experiences. Internal psychological factors helped to determine how they responded to the new demands of study. Four different educational responses to adult students could be identified. Direct and structured teaching could be seen in many vocational training models. Programs based on andrological principles put the emphasis on the individual&#8217;s self &#8211; directed learning. A third approach was focussed on critical pedagogy which sought to change society. There was also evidence of a holistic approach, which was centred on the adult learners but provided sympathetic educators to support their learning. The researcher&#8217;s underlying perspective in carrying out this study was that associated with Weber&#8217;s social action theory, because of the way it enabled emphasis to be placed on the actions of individuals and their interpretations of their actions in their social and cultural contexts. In this research portfolio the individuals concerned were politicians and educational administrators making policy decisions (Part 1); teachers developing appropriate programs (Part 2); and adult students deciding to return to studies and participating in adult programs (Part 3). Part 1 of Portfolio Two main sources of data were used to investigate the reasons for the 1989 policy decision to establish a system of adult re-entry colleges and schools within the Education Department of South Australia. The first was the official Hansard record of debates in the South Australian Parliament during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The second was a series of interviews with the Minister of Education involved and key officials in the Departments of Education and TAFE. The debates were focussed on the ideal educational location for adult re-entry students. Arguments based on the perspective of social justice and the special needs of adult students led to the establishment of a formal network of sites and programs to cater for the needs of adults within the secondary school sector. Despite the closure of one site in 1996 and funding readjustments in 1998, by 2005 adult re-entry colleges and schools had a well established role in South Australian public education system. Part 2 of Portfolio The investigation into the development of adult re-entry programs on one site was based on documents available in the Research School chosen &#8211; annual statistics, reports, curriculum, administration and journals. In addition, key members of staff involved in the adult program were interviewed. There was evidence of the way the adult program had changed over the period 1990 - 2005 in response to changing demography in the surrounding area and to changing needs and interests of those returning to study, as well as satisfying Departmental requirements. In recent years there has been a trend for more students to study part &#8211; time and to seek vocational rather than pre &#8211; university education. The provision of appropriate courses, resources and support was regarded by staff as important in the ongoing success of the adult re-entry program. Part 3 of Portfolio The investigation of adult students&#8217; motivations and experiences in returning to study was based on the memoirs and personal statements of 40 adult re-entry students from the Research School. Their comments provided a unique understanding of the diverse personal worlds of adult re-entry students, their expectations, goals and aspirations, their difficulties and problems and their learning experiences. The formation of adult campuses in the secondary sector in South Australia was influenced by both pragmatic factors and by principles of social justice which sought to promote educational opportunities and offer those who had left school without recognised qualifications a second chance. Adult re-entry sites have continued to provide for the needs of adult learners in the communities they serve. They have made an important contribution both to the individual&#8217;s right to life &#8211; long learning and to society&#8217;s need for skilled workers and well educated professionals. During the twenty first century adult sites in South Australia within the Department of Education and Children&#8217;s Services have faced two challenges. The learning interests of adult students have changed, with more looking to the acquisition of technical and vocational skills. Furthermore, in order to remain viable, adult sites have had to maintain a high profile in relation to innovative policy development, student numbers, funding and resource allocation. Their successes have been due in large measure to their recognition that adult re-entry students were not big kids, but required specific educational structure and programs catering for their diverse learning needs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">re-entry education; adult learning; adult education; principles; social justice in education; memoir method</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking existing databases to monitor and improve diabetes care</field><field name="creator">Joshy, Grace</field><field name="description">Background Lack of population based data is a critical problem in diabetes surveillance in New Zealand. This thesis looks at the feasibility, strengths and weaknesses of linking existing databases to create a regional diabetes register in the Waikato. Methods Completeness and validity of key databases and agreement between common data items have been studied using the following audits and studies linking multiple data sources: &#8226; A pilot study in a rural town (Taumarunui), linking multiple data sources including the secondary care based Waikato Regional Diabetes Service (WRDS) database and the Get Checked data from primary care. &#8226; A general practice based study in Hamilton, linking primary care data (diagnosis codes, prescriptions, laboratory tests, Get Checked) with the WRDS database. &#8226; Another general practice based study in Rotorua, a town with high Maori population, linking primary care data with deprivation scores. &#8226; Audits using WRDS data and Waikato DHB hospital systems to assess data agreement. &#8226; Retention of patients in the Get Checked programme was examined using Waikato Primary Health&#8217;s data. &#8226; Three retrospective studies linking the WRDS data with Waikato DHB hospital systems and national mortality data, which looked at hospital admissions, progression of renal disease and mortality. The studies used several methods of data validation including comparison of datasets, manual search of patient records, direct contact with patients and comparison of data from external sources. Linked datasets were used to identify disparities in prevalence of diabetes, access to diabetes care, diabetes complications and mortality. Results iii &#8226; The coverage of the WRDS database was high (86%-91%), but newly diagnosed patients and older patients not needing retinal screening are underrepresented. Case identification using primary care systems was high, but the coverage of the &#8220;Get Checked&#8221; programme (62%-80%) varied depending on practice IT systems, data handling procedures and patient characteristics. &#8226; The Rotorua study shows that diabetes prevalence rises with increasing deprivation among Europeans, but not among Maori. &#8226; Maori and Asian patients were less likely to access retinal screening in Hamilton. Patients aged&lt;40 years, those of Maori or Asian origin, and those with Type 1 diabetes were less likely to be retained in the Get Checked programme with regular checks. Almost all patients had barriers to diabetes care in Taumarunui. Psychological barriers to diabetes care rank highly for all subgroups of ethnicity, age, gender, duration of diabetes and insulin treatment. &#8226; Outcomes analyses showed that compared with Europeans with diabetes, Maori diabetes patients had a significantly higher risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal admission and renal death (46-fold, seven-fold and fourfold increases, respectively). Maori patients progressed at a significantly faster rate from first hospital admission for chronic renal disease to ESRD. Maori were more likely than Europeans to have diabetes reported on mortality coding. They were also were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease, cancer and renal disease [Hazard-ratios 2.31(1.6-3.3), 1.83(1.1-3), and 11.74(4.8-29) respectively]. Discussion The advantages and the difficulties of linking primary care and secondary care databases to identifying diagnosed diabetes patients, the potential barriers to implementation of a diabetes register and the critical factors for a successful system are discussed. This research has demonstrated the potential of linking databases to monitor diabetes care and outcomes, but implementation would need substantial policy changes and financial backing.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the acidic protein fraction of bovine whey and its effect on bone cells : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Chemistry at Massey University, New Zealand EMBARGOED till 1 December 2015</field><field name="creator">Mullan, Bernadette Jane</field><field name="description">Milk is provided to new borns as their first food source and it contains essential nutrients, vitamins and other beneficial components, such as enzymes and antibodies that are required for rapid growth and development of the new born and for sustained growth over time. Milk contains two main types of proteins; casein proteins and whey proteins. Although casein proteins account for up to 80% of the proteins found in bovine milk, it is the whey protein that has become of high interest because of its bioactive content. Whey, a very watery mixture of lactose, proteins, minerals and trace amounts of fat, is formed from milk when the milk is coagulated and/or the casein proteins are removed from the milk. Bovine whey protein, including both the acidic and basic fractions (low and high isoelectric point, respectively), has previously been studied in vitro (cell based) and in vivo (using rats) for its impact on bone to determine if it can help improve bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of developing bone diseases, such as osteoporosis. Bone is constantly undergoing a remodelling process of being dissolved and reformed and the two main cell types responsible for this bone remodelling process are mature osteoclasts, which dissolve (resorb) bone, and osteoblasts, which reform the bone. Prior work has shown that acidic protein fractions derived from different sources of whey protein concentrate (WPC) have both in vivo and in vitro activity on bone, particularly anti-resorptive properties. However, the component(s) which confer activity have not yet been identified. In this thesis, work was undertaken to better understand the analytical composition of three types of WPC (cheese, mineral acid and lactic acid) and their associated acidic protein fractions and relate this to bone activity in the hope of identifying where the activity lies. Bone activity was assessed using in vitro screening with osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) and osteoclast cells (RAW 264.7). Comparison of the cell-based bone activity of the parent WPCs and corresponding acidic fractions indicated that the acidic fractions derived from both mineral acid and lactic WPC were superior in their ability to inhibit osteoclast development. Although compositional data was complex and definitive correlations with both bone bioactivities could not be made, it appeared that elements common to both the acidic fractions were a higher proportion of GLYCAM-1 and bone sialoprotein-1 (osteopontin). Further studies to more closely investigate the bone bioactivity of the acidic fractions are warranted.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bovine whey protein concentrate</field><field name="subject">Acidic protein fractions</field><field name="subject">Bone bioactivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry::250302 Biological and medical chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and physiological responses of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) to the presence of humans and dogs :|ba thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beausoleil, Ngaio Jessica</field><field name="description">Appendices removed due to copyright restrictions  Appendix 1: Beausoleil, N J, Stafford, KJ, Mellor, DJ. 2005.

In particular, the research explored how social work supervision was constructed, the influence of the Aotearoa New Zealand context upon its construction, and where and how social work supervision can most effectively be improved. In order to provide a background for informed analysis and discussion of the research findings, key themes within the international and Aoteaoroa New Zealand supervision literature were discussed. The thesis was a mixed methods study that was informed by a constructionist conceptual framework with regard to the framing and exploration of the research questions. The methodological approach used was derived from pragmatism and involved a combination of survey research with qualitative individual interviews, with the survey being used to recruit and purposefully select participants for the individual interviews. The key findings from the study were: a) social work supervision was predominantly constructed from a professional standpoint, with the social, organisational and interpersonal context influencing how supervision was produced in any setting at anytime; b) the Aotearoa New Zealand context influenced supervision through the discourses of biculturalism and indigenous development, with multiculturalism being a secondary influence; and c) that improvements were needed in the professional and organisational systems that support supervision as well as in the practice and provision of it. The implications and recommendations arising from these findings focus on social work supervision theory and practice, cultural competence and the further development of professional supervision. From these implications it is suggested that the future research and development agenda for social work supervision both internationally and within Aotearoa New Zealand concerns theory-building, responding to the dynamics of culture and difference within supervision and the professionalisation of supervision. The recommendations related to the professionalisation of supervision concern: formal education and training; the role of supervision within organisations and contribution to organisational development; and the need for a stronger evidence-base regarding supervision&#8217;s contribution to client practice and social worker well-being and development.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social work supervision</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picturing home : home as represented in vernacular image making : written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington</field><field name="creator">Oldfield, Christina</field><field name="description">This project grew out of an interest in notions of &#8216;home&#8217;, what &#8216;home&#8217; is and its relationship to the &#8216;house&#8217; as a physical place of dwelling.

A valid and reliable measure of children&#8217;s preferred coping styles in dental situations may assist dental staff in providing efficacious anxiety-reducing interventions to diverse groups of children. The current study sought to validate a scale of children&#8217;s preference for monitoring or blunting in dental situations (the Monitoring Blunting Dental Scale or MBDS). The psychometric characteristics of the scale were assessed in a group of 240 eleven to thirteen year old New Zealand children. Internal consistency reliability was adequate for both the monitoring ( = .743) and blunting ( = .762) subscales. Convergent validity was indicated by strong correlations (&gt; .6) between the MBDS monitoring and blunting subscales and those of an adapted version of the Child Behavioural Style Scale (CBSS-M). Discriminant validity with respect to dental anxiety was strong for the monitoring subscale, r = .079, p = .221, but not the blunting subscale, r = .478, p &lt;.001. Confirmatory factor analysis of the MBDS indicated adequate fit for a two factor monitoring-blunting model (RMSEA = .079), but unacceptable fit for a one factor model (RMSEA = .095). A similar finding was observed when confirmatory factor analysis of the CBSS-M was conducted. These confirmatory factor analyses suggested that the monitoring and blunting theoretical constructs cannot be justifiably regarded as representing poles of a single underlying dimension, but are better regarded as distinct, related constructs. A content analysis of children&#8217;s comments about the coping strategies they might adopt in several dental scenarios indicated that these strategies were largely classifiable within monitoring-blunting theory, with blunting-type strategies much more commonly mentioned. Given further validity evidence, the MBDS could be a useful measure when attempting to tailor anxiety-reducing interventions in dental settings to children with diverse coping preferences.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental anxiety</field><field name="subject">Anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380101 Sensory processes perception and performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Valuing our place : a critical exploration of frameworks for assessing the significance of New Zealand's historic heritage : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donaghey, Sara</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction; Donaghey, S.

Twenty-five of 30 assessed virulence factor gene (VFG) markers were detected at least once in 31 UPEC isolated from 20 UK cats and 89 UPEC isolated from dogs (56), cats (22) and people (11) living in New Zealand (NZ). The PFGE banding patterns of UPEC isolates from different individuals were markedly dissimilar unless isolates had been collected at the same hospital within one month of each other. In contrast, &#8805;2 UPEC strains isolated from each of 3 UK cats diagnosed with multiple UTIs were indistinguishable by PFGE. Antibiograms inaccurtely predicted UPEC clonality and, of clinical importance, underestimated the number of relapsing or persistent infections in these cats. A comparison of VFG profiles and PFGE banding patterns of UPEC isolated from NZ and UK cats demonstrated a geographically uneven distribution of pathotypic and phylogenetic traits and indicated that, among other factors, the source of UPEC must be considered when comparing UPEC from different host species. When comparing UPEC isolates from NZ dogs, cats and people, strains with similar VFG profiles were found among the different host species. Other strains, with VFG profiles that differed according to the host species of origin were also detected. The latter finding, which is in contrast to the results of previous studies, may be of interest to researchers aiming to predict the potential zoonotic risk posed by particular UPEC strains sourced from dogs and cats. Forty bacteriophages (phages for short) were isolated from sewage waters and propagated on UPEC strains. The ability of these phages to cause bacterial lysis was tested on 31 canine UPEC, 22 feline UPEC and 7 faecal E. coli. In contrast to faecal E. coli, UPEC strains were highly susceptible to phages. Ten phages with a particularly broad host range each lysed &#8805;27/53 (&#8805;51%) UPEC strains. Used in combination, these 10 phages were predicted to be able to lyse 49/53 (92%) of the UPEC strains in the collection. Morphological and genotypic studies on 5 of these 10 phages demonstrated that 4 of them belonged to the lytic T4-like genus, while one phage showed similarity to the temperate phage P2. Overall, results of this project indicate that the majority of canine and feline UPEC - with very diverse PFGE banding patterns and VFG profiles - are susceptible to lysis by naturally occurring phages. Hence, phages show promise as therapeutic agents for treatment of canine and feline UTI and, perhaps, for other infections caused by UPEC.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phages</field><field name="subject">Phylogeny</field><field name="subject">UPEC strains</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300510 Virology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ageing and vision impairment : activity, independence and life satisfaction : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Rehabilitation at Massey University, Palmerston North, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Good, Gretchen Ann</field><field name="description">Vision impairment profoundly affects older people, yet we do not know specifically which areas of daily living are most affected by vision impairment. Nor do we know how daily levels of activity and independence differ for this population compared to others their age. Understanding these differences can enhance goal-setting practices and improve rehabilitation services for older individuals with impaired vision. This study examined activity, independence and life satisfaction of older adults living in the Manawatu region of the North Island of New Zealand, using an adapted model of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The adapted model introduced subjective dimensions of functioning including satisfaction with activity, independence and life. This study was conducted with registered members of the Royal New Zealand Foundation of the Blind and with a random selection of registered voters in the region. Results indicated that both age and vision impairment had significant main effects on activity and independence. An interaction of age and vision had effect on the number of recently relinquished activities participants reported, social comparisons of activity and independence, and on satisfaction with independence and with life. An examination of age cohorts assisted in an improved understanding of daily functioning for this population. Unique findings were that social comparison of activity and satisfaction with social support contributed more to overall life satisfaction than did activity and independence levels. Unexpectedly, the oldest age cohort of those with impaired vision reported a higher level of overall life satisfaction than did their sighted peers in the oldest age cohort or younger cohorts with impaired vision. Results of this study will enable a better understanding of daily life for older people, and the differences which can be attributed to vision impairment. Older people and those that provide rehabilitation services to them can use this information to set more realistic and appropriate goals for rehabilitation. The results of this study will also allow those involved in personnel preparation programmes to develop curricula to improve new practitioners' understanding of typical daily life of older people with and without impaired vision.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Impaired vision in older people</field><field name="subject">Blindness, social aspects</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321212 Care for disabled</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The search for sustainable competitive advantage : a stakeholder management perspective : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wu, Minyu</field><field name="description">Competitive advantage and stakeholder management are two important research streams that have attracted much attention during the past two decades. Although competitive advantage is the core issue of strategic management in which stakeholder management is rooted, the two topics have developed seemingly independently in the literature. The main purpose of this thesis is to explore how stakeholder management influences competitive advantage. The research is guided by a theoretical framework that employs a stakeholder perspective, linking three perspectives of competitive advantage&#8212;the resource-based view, the relational view, and the activity-position view. The general research approach chosen is a qualitative, multiple-case study. Ten cases were selected, from leading firms of several industries in Taiwan, and in-depth interviews were conducted. Results showed that a firm&#8217;s competitive advantage comes from its resource capacity (superior resources, unique capabilities, and solid relationships) and a mix of activities that respond to the competitive context. Competitive advantage, too, can be analysed in terms of two components: resource advantage and positional advantage. Stakeholder management can have significant influences on resource advantages as stakeholders play important roles in the process of value creation. They are the providers who supply valued resources to the firm and, as such, can act as catalysts or hindrances that either facilitate or impede the generation of valued resources. Successful stakeholder management strengthens a firm&#8217;s resource profile and thus enhances its resource advantages. Stakeholder management also has considerable influences on positional advantages, as stakeholders are relevant to activities and drivers that determine cost and differentiation. Moreover, stakeholders are key players in the competitive context, who help to shape the competitiveness of the firm. The study reported that stakeholder management helps to sustain competitive advantage through advancing a firm&#8217;s resource capacity&#8212;resource commitment, developing capabilities, and building relationships. Stakeholder management also generates several isolating mechanisms that preserve competitive advantage, including time compression diseconomies, causal ambiguity, social complexity, and transaction costs. However, in the face of ever-changing situations, managers need to adopt different strategies for managing stakeholder relations. To achieve sustained competitive advantage in a dynamic context, firms not only have to strengthen the capacity of resource advantage to fit the competitive strategy, but also need to use innovative and entrepreneurial approaches for managing their stakeholder relations.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic management</field><field name="subject">Taiwan</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Holistic professional military development : growing strategic artists : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simons, Murray</field><field name="description">Professional military education is a well&#8208;established system in most modern militaries. Like all things though, incremental and ad hoc improvements to legacy approaches typically lead to reduced quality. It is therefore, essential to periodically review the entire system for holistic effectiveness. For military education, this need is particularly important when the global security environment is experiencing such rapid change. Added to this is the emerging understanding of the &#8216;new sciences&#8217; that provides a unique opportunity to improve cognitive agility when confronting complex adaptive systems. There is also an urgent need to acknowledge and enhance the intangible dimension of professional military education beyond mere content&#8208;centric subject expertise. From the literature on hidden learning and constructivism, there are a number of opportunities available for modernizing the legacy paradigm of professional military education. This study investigated the role of holistic learning (formal, non&#8208;formal, informal, selfdirected, and incidental learning) in the professional development of 29 mid&#8208;career military officers. It involved detailed study of their participation on the seven&#8208;month staff course at the New Zealand Defence College from May to December 2008. Mixed methodology data collection included observations, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, and document analysis. Analytic procedures ranged from statistical comparisons through to qualitative theme constructs. The study found a number of dimensions (sources and influences) contributing to holistic learning. It also identified a number of opportunities to improve the learning experience. The findings identify a number of important factors in developing strategic artists. Of these, the greatest need is for a strategic plan to extend the current content&#8208;centric syllabus into a full curriculum with intangible traits clearly linked to formal and informal learning activities. Specific components required in this strategic plan include an academic philosophy and a cross&#8208;referencing matrix. The study also recommends reviewing time allocated to cross&#8208;discipline learning of the profession and cognitive agility focused on deep learning. There is also a need to re&#8208;examine the directing staff requirements, management of learner stress, and shaping practical&#8208;value motivation strategies through cultural artefacts. Collectively, the findings recommend shifting from the traditional vessel&#8208;filling paradigm of formal courses to a sociological approach of growing strategic leaders.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Military education</field><field name="subject">Holistic learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::339900 Other Education::339999 Other education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential of ecotourism to contribute to local sustainable development : a case study in Kiet Ngong village in Xe Pian National Protected Area, Lao PDR : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Phanthavong, Alavanh</field><field name="description">The ecotourism industry is experiencing increasing popularity as the demand grows for tourism that is environmentally sensitive, informative, and beneficial for local communities. For over a decade, Lao PDR, an underdeveloped country, has been promoting its 20 National Protected Areas as ecotourism destinations. These ecotourism projects are positioned as tools for protecting natural resources and reducing poverty, and are generating hope for the creation of local sustainable development. At this point in time, however, the Lao government lacks effective strategies for ensuring their long term success. This thesis was designed to address this concern by analysing the potential for one of these projects, Xe Pian ecotourism, to contribute to local sustainable development. The current outcomes of the Xe Pian ecotourism project were analysed and input was sought from all stakeholders concerning ideas for desirable strategies. Kiet Ngong village, located inside the Xe Pian NPA, Lao PDR, was selected for case study. Data was gathered by employing mostly quantitative methods consisting of semi-structured interviews, informal and formal interviews, private walks and observation, and questionnaire surveys. The findings illustrated that ecotourism in Kiet Ngong has impacted local livelihoods and other environmental, economic, social, and cultural factors in both positive and negative ways. However, the positive effects of Xe Pian ecotourism were found to be more significant than the negative effects. Importantly, Kiet Ngong residents expressed optimism about the future of ecotourism and have claimed that any negative consequences cannot discourage their desire for continuing ecotourism development. This research also revealed that the stakeholders involved in the project are able to offer a variety of strategies for resolving problems that have arisen along the way. Results from this study identified three main points that need to be addressed in order to maintain Xe Pian ecotourism, namely the promotion of economic and political empowerment of the local population, the development of external and internal regulations, and the adoption of a community-based ecotourism approach. Further recommendations are offered for the policy planners of both the government and the project&#8216;s administrative bodies, as well as for the residents of Kiet Ngong. These are followed by additional suggestions for further study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecotourism impacts</field><field name="subject">Ecotourism development</field><field name="subject">Community-based ecotourism</field><field name="subject">Laos</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping what matters in New Zealand museums : stakeholder perspectives on museum performance and accountability : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management and Museum Studies, Massey University Albany, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Legget, Jane Anne</field><field name="description">Accountability for museum performance was investigated in the context of New Zealand's public museums. Governing bodies account for museum performance through published annual reports, while performance assessment assists museum managers to achieve museums' objectives. Museum professionals also have expectations of museums. This research questioned whether museums were reporting on the aspects of their performance that mattered to a wider range of stakeholders. The research is both descriptive and exploratory. A nationwide survey of museum directors gathered data about performance assessment at publicly-funded museums where one or more paid staff made management decisions. The Survey's descriptive findings, covering experiences and views of museum assessment practice, set the wider context for an exploratory Case Study of a large museum, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. Various groups of stakeholders identified aspects of the case museum's performance that matter to them and the ways in which they might assess them. Maori perspectives were contributed by several participants, a recognition of the importance of taonga Maori collections in New Zealand museums. Diverse museum stakeholders co-created statements as potential performance assessment criteria. A concept mapping process, involving these statements, revealed distinct conceptual elements of the construct, an 'effectively performing museum', reflecting the respondent groups' differing realities, yet much common ground. Three analytical approaches, functional, structural and cultural, compared and contrasted the concepts and their relative importance. The research identified dimensions of museum performance that could contribute to an integrated framework for museum performance assessment meaningful to a wider range of stakeholders. A conceptual model for museum accountability was developed. Findings suggest that museum performance indicators in New Zealand should extend beyond a focus on visitor numbers and satisfaction to include collection health, staffing quality, Maori concerns and community relationships. Assessment of these factors would enable museums to better account for their performance as community assets.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museum management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Credibility and validation through syntheses of customary and contemporary knowledge : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nixon, Marie Ann Zillah</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Nixon, M.

The plasma accelerators are required to be capable of reproducible results of 0.2mg of hydrogen plasma at velocities in excess of 200km/s and be possible of operating at 10Hz. No previously developed pulse plasma accelerator is capable of these results. The purpose of this thesis was to develop a plasma accelerator for application to the proposed fusion scheme. The previously unexplored possibility of using a piezoelectric valve in these devices was investigated. The piezoelectric valve that was developed is capable of generating reproducible, short, well defined hydrogen pulses with longitudinal temperatures below 2K. Presently the valve can deliver a maximum output of 0.022mg of hydrogen gas. A unique coaxial plasma accelerator, the Lica was developed that has three main features that set it apart: 1) it uses a piezoelectric valve to deliver short well defined hydrogen pulses into the accelerator, 2) the gas is linearly injected into the device and 3) it uses a novel preionization method. Currently the Lica is unable to offer the performance required for the proposed fusion scheme, the bulk of the plasma generated in this device appears to be travelling the region of 40-50km/s at a temperature of 3000K to 5000K. There are a few anomalies in the operation of this device: 1) it appears to accelerate a series of plasma sheaths in the regions of 40km/s, 50km/s and 60-80km/s, 2) the final plasma velocity appears to be independent of the acceleration distance and in some instances high velocity plasma in the region of 200km/s was observed. A numerical finite element model (FEM) electromagnetic model called MATAC was developed to try and simulate the operation of the Lica, because it was shown that simple analytical models are inadequate. The preliminary modelling efforts predicted the final velocity of the bulk of the plasma to be 82.6km/s. A spin off from the development of the numerical model was the extension of the upwinding scheme of [157] to quadratic and cubic FEM elements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasma acceleration</field><field name="subject">Finite element model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

L.</field><field name="description">Air-suspension particle coating is a process by which thin coatings are applied to powder particles. The coatings can be formulated to act as permeable barriers to increase powder shelf-life or to impart controlled release character. The ultimate objective of a coating operation is to produce individual particles, each with a well-controlled, even coating. This project was focused on the air-suspension coating of fine powders of ~100 &#181;m in diameter for the dairy industry. Despite the widespread use of the technology in the pharmaceutical industry, its use in the food industry has been limited. Little is known about the fundamental mechanisms, and so published work to date is product and equipment specific and is statistical in the way the experimental design and analysis has been approached. This 'black box' approach is time consuming and costly. Better methods based on an understanding of the physical and chemical mechanisms are needed to deal with the numerous products and constantly changing formulations typical of the dairy industry. This thesis proposes a new approach to air-suspension particle coating research. The basis of this 'micro-level process approach', is to deconvolute the complex coating process into smaller manageable parts based on classical physical phenomena for which descriptions already exist. The thesis identifies and develops an understanding of the key micro-level processes controlling coated product quality and process performance. Four were selected for further study: drying, droplet impact and spreading, and stickiness which encompasses the two key micro-level processes of droplet impact and adherence and inter-particle agglomeration. They were studied separately to deconvolute the variable effects and interactions. Kinetic data were collected for the drying droplets containing maltodextrins, whey protein isolate and gum arabic. A mathematical model, based on 'ideal shrinkage' was developed to predict the drying kinetics of single droplets with particular interest in the development of the surface glass transition temperature. The model accurately predicted the kinetics until significant morphological changes occurred in the droplet. To better predict the kinetics late in the drying process, the droplet radius was set to be constant at a time based on the surface proximity to the surface glass transition temperature (critical X concept). This was done to arrest droplet shrinkage in line with experimental observations and to more accurately depict the drying of high molecular weight, amorphous glass forming polymers. After this point, a new flexible calculation scheme was used to better predict the variation in internal droplet structure as either a dense, 'collapsed shell' structure or a 'dense skin-porous crumb' structure. Further study should focus on the surface and internal droplet structure (porosity and mechanical integrity) development during drying, particularly the conditions leading to the arresting of the droplet radius and the subsequent rate of skin thickness progression. The critical X concept was used to make industrial-scale predictions of the optimum drying conditions that ensure maximum droplet impact and adherence efficiency and minimum inter-particle agglomeration in a W&#252;rster-style coating operation. This enabled the prediction of two key design parameters, the nozzle distance from the powder impact point and the W&#252;rster insert height. The span in design parameters showed that there is significant opportunity for design optimisation based on the critical X concept. A probe tack test was used to map the level of stickiness of droplets of different coating materials as they dried. As skin formation progressed, the stickiness passed through a maximum, in most cases to arrive at a point at which the droplet was no longer sticky at all (non-adhesive state). The maximum point of stickiness represents the ideal state to ensure successful droplet-substrate impact and adherence. The minimum point of stickiness represents the ideal state to prevent unwanted inter-particle agglomeration. The time interval between the onset of stickiness and the non-adhesive state was particularly dependent on the addition of plasticisers, but also on the formulation and the drying air conditions. Future work should look to establish a possible relationship between the surface glass transition temperature and the probe tack test stickiness measurements. The impact and spreading of droplets containing maltodextrin DE5 on to solid anhydrous milkfat was studied using a high speed video camera. It was found that the final spread diameter was able to be fixed close to the maximum spread diameter by using surfactants, thus avoiding significant recoil. Because existing literature focuses on predicting the maximum spread diameter, this work defines a need for adequate prediction methods for the final spread diameter, as this is the significant parameter in coating applications. Formulation and operating guidelines were established to independently optimise each micro-level process. These were used in a series of population based coating experiments in a pilot-scale W&#252;rster coater. This study highlighted the limited flexibility of the standard 'off-the-shelf' W&#252;rster coating apparatus for the coating of fine sized dairy powders. Because of this, the validation of the guidelines were inconclusive and optimisation could not be carried out. Further validation work is required on a custom-built apparatus for dairy powders. This work has advanced the fundamental knowledge of the coating process and is independent of material, equipment and scale. This knowledge, based on physical and chemical mechanisms, can be used to develop coating formulations and identify optimum process conditions for successful coating in less time and at less expense than is current practice. The next step is to put the guidelines into practice and craft the engineering of a continuous coating apparatus for dairy powder applications.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dairy powder coating</field><field name="subject">Spray drying</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Providing therapy in the context of third party determined time limits: A mixed methods study of psychologists' experiences of working in pre-set timeframes</field><field name="creator">Wright, Tracey Emily</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time-limited therapy</field><field name="subject">managed care</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing the teaching of drama : school-based, needs-driven professional learning</field><field name="creator">Perry, Rachel</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how the teaching of drama can be enhanced through needs-driven, school-based professional learning. It was motivated by a personal &#8216;living contradiction&#8217;, involving the frustration that can result when beliefs and actions do not correspond. My learning journey continued through literature searches and preliminary work with teachers that resulted in an effective process of professional learning with five teachers. The research design draws on elements of action research, situated, and action learning theories, to develop a process of &#8216;facilitated action research&#8217;. Informed, but not limited by existing models of action research, this collaborative process was responsive to teacher preferences in addressing the three research aims. Evolving over two phases with eleven teachers, the bulk of the study followed the stories of five teachers and their professional learning. Data collection tools included the use of semi-structured interviews, conversations, a questionnaire, survey and reflective journals. The findings demonstrated that professional learning, responsive to context and self-identified needs, positively enhanced the teaching of drama. Teacher confidence and awareness of drama gradually increased, as did teacher ability to self-direct learning. Areas of skill development, integration and time management were initially identified as a focus for professional learning, with classroom and behaviour management added as school-based issues arose. Establishing a &#8216;common understanding of drama&#8217; was acknowledged as critical for effective collaborative learning to take place. Personal factors including confidence, experience and belief, and the contextual factors of parental expectation, outcomes, time, space and past professional learning were found to facilitate or constrain drama use. The research found that professional learning, characterised by a respect for past experiences, assisted in the creation of a &#8216;safe space&#8217; for learning. Tailoring professional learning to needs and the school context was also found to motivate teachers and was effective in enhancing the teaching of drama. My role as &#8216;facilitator&#8217; became embedded in the collaborative process, adding to a personal understanding of role and school-based learning. This study is significant for teachers, professional learning facilitators and those working in drama education. It contributes to the minimal research emphasising professional learning for drama, and strengthens existing arguments for needs-driven, school-based teacher development.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drama.</field><field name="subject">Education, Primary.</field><field name="subject">Action learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">2-Iodoxybenzoic Acid: Acidity Investigations and The Total Synthesis of 5,14-bis-epi-Spirovibsanin A</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Gallen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ibx, acidity, pka, oxidation, spirovibsanin a, diterpene, total synthesis, natural product, spirolactone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dialogue game in defeasible logic</field><field name="creator">Subhasis Thakur</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomimetic Orientated Total Synthesis of Neovibsane Natural Products and Comparison of Synthetic Neovibsanes on Neurite Outgrowth Promotion in PC12 Cells</field><field name="creator">Annette Chen</field><field name="description">Neovibsanin A and B are natural products which induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. They belong in the neovibsane class under the rare vibsane natural product family, whose structures are characterized by polycyclic, polyoxygenated cores. Based on a proposed biosynthesis, the synthetic strategy towards neovibsanin A and B involved synthesizing a key enone intermediate. Initial investigation using this intermediate lead to the total synthesis of 2-O-methylneovibsanin H. Crucial to this concise synthesis was an acid-catalyzed, one-pot, four-step cascade reaction. Modifying the reaction condition leads to a different five-step cascade pathway, resulting in the total synthesis of 4,5-bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B. The synthetic trials and tribulations encountered on the road to these final compounds are explored. It is envisaged that other related neovibsane natural products may arise based on this synthetic sequence. 4,5-Bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B, as well as several other structural analogues collected during the synthesis, were biologically assayed using NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. All compounds induced a significant proportion of neurons to extend neurite processes compared to control cultures. The structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the tricyclic core, as well as the 3,3-dimethylacroyl enol ester side chain, may be responsible for promoting a biological response.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neovibsanin a</field><field name="subject">neovibsanin b</field><field name="subject">2-O-methylneovibsanin h</field><field name="subject">biological activity</field><field name="subject">neurite outgrowth</field><field name="subject">natural product</field><field name="subject">total synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cavin proteins as regulators of caveola formation and function</field><field name="creator">Michele Bastiani</field><field name="description">Caveolae are small plasma membrane invaginations present in many different cell types, which have been linked to diverse cellular functions, including cell signalling, membrane rearrangements and lipid regulation. The caveolae markers, members of the caveolin family of proteins, are essential for caveola formation and function. Recently, however, a protein named PTRF (Polymerase I and Transcript Release Factor) or cavin, originally identified as a nuclear factor that regulates transcription in vitro, was shown to be associated with caveolae in adipocytes. In the first chapter of this thesis, I have used the zebrafish Danio rerio to investigate the relation of PTRF/cavin to caveolae as well as caveola function in vivo. During zebrafish development, PTRF/cavin was highly expressed in the notochord in 18 h, 24 h and 35 h post-fertilization embryos, as detected by in situ hybrydization. Analysis of later development stages showed that PTRF/cavin is also present in the otic vesicle, brachial arches, and periderm. Disruption of PTRF/cavin expression, via morpholino-mediated inhibition, caused severely defective development of the notochord as well as heart edema, in a dose-dependent manner. PTRF/cavin knockdown embryos had curved notochords and were shorter than the controls. Examination of the notochord by electron microscopy showed that the number of caveolae was greatly reduced in PTRF/cavin-morpholino-injected embryos. Similar effects were observed when caveolin-1, the major protein of caveolae in non-muscle cells, was down-regulated. Altogether, these results indicated a role for PTRF/cavin during formation and/or stabilization of caveolae as well as an essential role for caveolae during zebrafish embryo development. Combined with results obtained in mammalian cells, these findings identify PTRF/cavin as the first component of a caveolar coat, required for caveola formation and function (Hill et al., 2008). We subsequently identified a family of PTRF/cavin-related proteins, the cavins, that all associate with caveolae. Using biochemistry, light microscopy, and FRET-based approaches we characterised PTRF/cavin and the new members of this family of proteins SDR/cavin-2, SRBC/cavin-3 and MURC/cavin-4. We have shown that the four members of the cavin family form a multi-protein complex that associates with caveolae. This complex can constitutively assemble in the cytosol and then associate with caveolin at the plasma membrane caveolae; interestingly, caveolin is essential for the plasma membrane translocation of the cavin complex, and in caveolin-1 knockout cells the four cavin proteins are restricted to the cytosol. PTRF/cavin-1, but not other cavins, can induce caveola formation in a heterologous system and is required for the recruitment of the cavin complex to caveolae. The four cavin proteins present distinct patterns of tissue expression, which suggests that caveolae may perform tissue-specific functions regulated by the composition of the cavin complex. MURC/cavin-4 is expressed predominantly in muscle and its distribution is perturbed in human muscle disease associated with caveolin-3 dysfunction, identifying MURC/cavin-4 as a novel muscle disease candidate caveolar protein. To functionally investigate the relation of cavins and caveolae, we explored a caveolar function in mechanosensation. Through the use of hypo-osmotic media, we induced membrane-stretch and showed that the increased membrane tension leads to dissociation of the caveolin-cavin module and caveola disassembly as observed by immunofluorescence and FLIM/FRET techniques. Once released from caveolae, caveolin was seen internalized in late endosomes and lysosomes. Cavin-1, on the other hand, was found to be diffused in the cytosol and from there it was translocated to the nuclear compartment. The nuclear translocation was observed in several different cell types, which suggests a universal role for nuclear cavin-1, and was independent of caveolin expression. Analysis of live cells using real-time FLIM/FRET showed that cells quickly respond to variations in membrane tension by dissociation/re-association of caveolin and cavin-1. Altogether, in the course of this project, I was able to show that cavin-1 is an essential regulator of caveola biogenesis in cultured cells and in vivo. Cavin-1 and the other members of the PTRF/Cavin family form a multiprotein complex that is recruited to caveolae by caveolin and coats plasma membrane caveolae. The association between cavin-1 and caveolin is crucial for caveolae assembly and this interaction has a role in the cellular sensation of plasma membrane tension. Under high membrane tensions, caveolin and cavin-1 dissociate with the consequent flattening of caveolae. Under these circumstances, caveolin is internalized into enlarged endosomes and lysosomes while cavin-1 is translocated to the nucleus, identifying for the first time a caveola- to nucleus signalling pathway. The exact role of nuclear cavin-1 under plasma membrane stretch is now amenable to analysis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">caveolae</field><field name="subject">PTRF</field><field name="subject">cavins</field><field name="subject">coat complex</field><field name="subject">nuclear translocation</field><field name="subject">mechanosensation</field><field name="subject">zebrafish (Danio rerio)</field><field name="subject">muscle disease</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing of Virus-Like Particles</field><field name="creator">Daniel Lipin</field><field name="description">A virus-like particle (VLP) is a biological nanoparticle. It consists of the protective protein shell of a virus that is devoid of the nucleic acid required for viral replication. VLPs have two key uses: they can act as vaccines by inducing an immune response similar to their native virions, or they can facilitate gene therapy and drug delivery by encapsulating non-viral molecules and efficiently transporting them into cells. Manufacture of VLPs involves cell-based expression of virus-shell protein, with particle assembly and purification following one of two paradigms: (i) in vivo VLP assembly, followed by purification of full particles from cell lysate; (ii) partially assembled protein is recovered from cell lysate and assembled into VLPs in vitro. The flexibility and efficiency of both of these VLP manufacturing paradigms can be improved by first gaining a fundamental understanding of what is happening at key process steps. These improvements will lower the cost of VLP manufacture and enhance the viability of VLP products in the biopharmaceutical marketplace. The research reported here yielded positive outcomes for two key steps of the VLP manufacturing process, using murine polyomavirus VLPs for all experimentation. Firstly, enhanced understanding concerning the capture of virus shell protein in pentamer form (capsomeres) from cell lysate using glutathione-S-transferase (GST) affinity chromatography was obtained. It was discovered that prokaryotic expression of GST-tagged capsomeres yielded soluble aggregates having variable size distribution. Methods were developed to physically and chemically characterise these soluble aggregates, and the mechanism by which they adsorb to the chromatography resin was described using an established mathematical model. Secondly, particle characterisation of whole VLPs isolated from cell lysate was undertaken. Methods utilizing three orthogonal and quantitative techniques were developed to suggest that encapsulation of non-viral molecules (nucleic acids or proteins) during in vivo assembly causes distinct changes to the size distribution of isolated VLPs: transmission electron microscopy (TEM), asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation with multiple-angle light scattering (AFFFF-MALS) and electrospray differential mobility analysis (ES-DMA). The understanding gained from the research presented in this work enables the enhanced capture of partially assembled virus shell protein from cell lysate, as well as a method to efficiently and cost-effectively analyse VLP solutions for the presence of desirable or undesirable encapsulated material.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virus-like particle</field><field name="subject">capsomere</field><field name="subject">polyomavirus</field><field name="subject">glutathione-s-transferase</field><field name="subject">affinity chromatography</field><field name="subject">soluble aggregate</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation</field><field name="subject">transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">electrospray differential mobility analysis</field><field name="subject">nuclear localisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Dof transcription factor family in Triticum aestivum</field><field name="creator">Lindsay Shaw</field><field name="description">Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) play an indispensable role in cell biology as they are responsible for regulating gene activity. TFs act by binding to specific DNA sequences in a gene promoter resulting in either activation or repression of transcription of the target gene. TFs interact with target genes through a DNA binding domain which is often highly conserved and can be used to classify TFs into families. Dof (DNA binding with one finger) TFs are classified by the presence of a highly conserved bi-functional Dof domain. Characterisation of various Dof proteins has identified essential regulatory roles in plant-specific processes. This includes roles in carbon metabolism in maize, seed development and germination in Arabidopsis and cereal crops and circadian responses in Arabidopsis and rice. Despite the important role of Dof proteins in plant growth and development, this family has been studied to a limited extent in wheat with only two Dof proteins reported to date. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to identify and initiate characterisation of the Dof TF family in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and investigate the potential role of members of this family in wheat productivity-associated physiological processes. Thirty-one Dof genes were identified after extensive searching of available Triticum aestivum ESTs and contig assembly. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these 31 genes into four clades. Extensive gene expression profiling of the TaDof family was undertaken and revealed that the majority of TaDof members were constitutively expressed in major vegetative organs with a few displaying a grain-predominant expression pattern. The TaDof family appears to be enriched with light-responsive or drought down-regulated members, suggesting that the role of this family is predominantly in growth-related processes. To further investigate their role in growth-related physiological processes, two Dof genes, TaDof4 and TaDof5, were selected for more detailed characterisation. TaDof5 was identified to be similar to the Cycling Dof Factors from Arabidopsis and the recently identified rice Dof daily fluctuations genes which are involved in the photoperiodic regulation of flowering time. TaDof5 gene expression was diurnally regulated, had strong expression in the stem and head and a peak in expression level at anthesis. Using publicly available Affymetrix data, correlation analysis suggested co-expression of TaDof5 with a number of circadian-regulated genes associated with flowering. Extensive analysis of the DNA-binding specificity of TaDof5 revealed a preferred binding motif of 5&#8217;GAAAAAGTGC. The binding of TaDof5 to DNA requires two (A/T)AAAG(T/C) core motifs in adjacent positions. The binding sequence of TaDof5 was identified in the promoter of one of the TaDof5 co-expressed genes in wheat and subsequent analysis showed that TaDof5 was capable of binding to this promoter region with high affinity. These data suggest that TaDof5 may be involved in photoperiod responses associated with flowering time. TaDof4 was among a large number of previously identified growth-related genes expressed at significantly higher levels in wheat cultivars and progeny lines with high transpiration efficiency (TE) (the amount of biomass produced per unit of water transpired). Field trials were undertaken with the parents and progeny from a cross between Quarrion (high TE) and Genaro 81 (low TE) and demonstrated that the high TE progeny lines had improved early vegetative growth. TaDof4 was therefore characterised further for a role related to biomass production and/or contribution to the TE trait. Expression profiling showed that TaDof4 was consistently expressed at higher levels in the lines with high TE, constitutively expressed in major vegetative organs, drought down-regulated and sucrose up-regulated. Over-expression of TaDof4 identified one line with significantly improved biomass. DNA binding specificity analysis demonstrated that TaDof4 binds to the AAAG(T/C) core target motif essential for Dof DNA binding. These results suggest that TaDof4 is potentially associated with growth-related processes in wheat. In conclusion this study has made the following achievements: (1) identified 31 TaDof family members in Triticum aestivum, (2) used phylogenetic analysis and expression profiling to infer potential functional roles for wheat TaDof family members, (3) further characterised TaDof5 to reveal a potential role in photoperiod responses associated with flowering and elucidated its DNA-binding specificity, (4) further characterised TaDof4 to suggest a potential role in growth-related processes. These results provide fundamental molecular information that increases our understanding of the diverse biological roles of the TaDof family, particularly in growth-related physiological processes in wheat.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dof</field><field name="subject">Triticum aestivum</field><field name="subject">transcription factor</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">transgenic wheat</field><field name="subject">phylogenetic analysis</field><field name="subject">biomass</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Epidemiology of Sporadic Campylobacter Infection in Australia</field><field name="creator">Russell Stafford</field><field name="description">Campylobacter is currently the most common cause of acute bacterial diarrhoea in Australia among all the notified enteric pathogens with more than 15,000 cases each year. The incidence of notified campylobacteriosis has steadily increased during the past 15 years from 67.0/100,000 population in 1991 to 121.4/100,000 in 2005, though the factors contributing to this increase had not been studied. Adjusting for under-reporting there are, at this point in time, an estimated 225,000 infections occurring each year in Australia, most of which are sporadic in nature. Much of our knowledge in Australia about risk factors for sporadic disease has been based on overseas literature. Prior to the studies undertaken in this thesis, the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection had not been thoroughly studied in Australia, nor had there been any national studies examining risk factors for locally-acquired infection. The broad aim of this thesis was to examine in depth the descriptive epidemiology of Campylobacter infection in Australia, explore the reasons for the sustained increase in incidence of infection and to identify the major risk factors for locally acquired infection using a multi-centre case-control study design. The descriptive study of the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis in Australia was based on Australian notifiable disease surveillance data collected over a 15-year period between 1991 and 2005. This study described the key epidemiological characteristics of this disease in Australia and identified some significant differences in incidence trends across states and territories and among different age groups which had not been previously reported. The study identified gaps in our knowledge of this disease in Australia and made recommendations for future research including the investigation of factors associated with the decline in incidence of infection among children aged &#61603; 4 years and further studies to identify age and sex-specific risk factors for infection. The issue of seasonality, transmission routes and infection was addressed and areas for further research were specified including longitudinal studies at a regional level that incorporate a comparison of human, animal and environmental genotypes. This study also provided strong compelling evidence to support the hypothesis that the increase in notification rates in Australia during this period represented a real increase in the incidence of infection and that the main driving force behind this rise has been the ongoing increase in chicken consumption among the Australian public. The multi-centre case-control study, involving 1,714 participants &#61619; 5 years of age, identified the major foodborne and non-foodborne risk factors for Campylobacter infection among the general population in Australia. This study confirmed that chicken meat is a major source of sporadic infection in this country and is responsible for almost one-third of all cases that occur in the Australian community each year. Other independent risk factors for sporadic infection in Australia included consumption of offal and ownership of domestic dogs or chickens aged &#61500; 6 months. The Nagelkerke R&#178; value of 16% for the final multivariable model indicated a considerable proportion of our case-patients had unexplained risk factors. The combined population attributable risk (PAR) estimate for the independent foodborne risk factors in this study was 31%, which is considerably less than the 75% to 80% of cases in the general population which are thought to be caused through foodborne transmission. Possible explanations for these results include the likelihood that a proportion of foodborne transmission in Australia occurs through food vehicles other than chicken due to cross-contamination from raw products, and the likelihood that much of the population attributable risk that is unaccountered for, may in fact be due to inherent limitations of study design resulting in systematic errors (information bias) and possibly reduced estimates of effect. The burden of illness among the general population in Australia attributable to different independent risk factors was estimated using a novel method developed specifically for this study. Briefly, community incidence data was coupled with PAR data from the case-control study and simulation techniques were used to: (i) estimate the number of infections attributable to specific risk factors, and (ii) derive credible intervals for these estimates by modeling the uncertainty in each variable component. This model of using case-control data in conjunction with pre-existing surveillance data provides researchers with a simple but robust tool for conducting source attribution studies on enteric pathogens. In conclusion, the studies undertaken in this thesis have made important contributions to our understanding of the epidemiology of sporadic Campylobacter infection in Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">campylobacter, case-control, population attributable risk, risk factor, source attribution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape matrix development intensity and its impact on mammals</field><field name="creator">Megan Brady</field><field name="description">Landscape modification resulting in habitat loss, fragmentation and intensification of land use is a serious threat to the earth&#8217;s biological diversity and the primary cause of the current extinction crisis. Recent research suggests the human-modified area of the landscape (that is not &#8216;traditional&#8217; habitat for native species but potentially once was), or the &#8216;matrix&#8217; (as it is hereafter called) has a major influence on wildlife persistence in modified landscapes. However, the matrix is a poorly studied and inadequately understood element of a modified landscape. There are at least two reasons for this. Firstly, the predominance of island biogeography and metapopulation theories in ecological thinking ensured that the matrix has historically been ignored in ecological research. Secondly, it is difficult to analyse matrix effects without confounding effects of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation and other aspects of landscape modification. As landscapes are modified attributes of the matrix co-vary with attributes of patches and landscapes, entangling their relative impacts on wildlife. Thus to investigate the independent influence of the matrix on mammals I selected 19 study landscapes by rigorous criteria to control for all potentially confounding patch and landscape attributes such as remnant forest patch size, shape, vegetation type, condition and position in the landscape, presence of any large (potential &#8216;source&#8217;) native forest patches within the landscape unit, as well as matrix land use composition and history. A study landscape was defined as the area within a 500 m radius of a remnant forest patch edge. Landscapes were selected along a gradient of rural-suburban residential development spanning the broadest achievable range of what I call &#8216;matrix development intensity&#8217;. This gradient was quantified by a novel weighted road-length metric that considered multiple road attributes to give significance to the ecological impact of different roads. Mammals and their habitat were sampled in three landscape elements within each landscape: remnant patch core, remnant patch edge and matrix to allow a landscape level inference. Mammals were sampled by a combination of Elliott traps, wire cage traps, hair funnels, scats and direct sightings. Thirty environmental variables were measured including habitat structure and disturbance and a full floristic survey was conducted. The matrix intensity gradient was characterised by increased anthropogenic disturbance such as increased housing density, closer proximity of sample sites to houses and higher human disturbance across the landscape mosaic, including in the core of remnant patches. However, matrix intensity was not the greatest source of overall variation in structural and floristic habitat attributes. Therefore the confounding of matrix effects with effects of remnant forest patch habitat attributes were successfully ruled out. Management actions of individual landholders can shape habitat attributes essential to mammals across the landscape mosaic. Mammal response to matrix intensity was species specific. Several native species declined in abundance, others were more resilient to moderate levels of matrix intensity, one species increased in abundance, and at least one species appeared unaffected by matrix intensity. Native species richness peaked at moderate levels, while exotic species richness and feral predators increased with matrix intensity and were negatively correlated with native species. Species response to matrix intensity appeared related to their use of edge or matrix habitat. However, an ability to use the matrix per se may not translate into an ability to persist in a landscape where development substantially reduces the habitat or movement value of the matrix. Seven a priori models of various remnant patch habitat, landscape and matrix influences on terrestrial mammal species richness were tested. Matrix attributes were the most important determinants of species richness. Matrix development intensity had a strong negative effect while matrix vegetation structural complexity had a strong positive effect on mammal species richness. Distance to the nearest remnant forest habitat was relatively unimportant. I hypothesised that thresholds of matrix intensity would exist where native species decline in abundance and exotic and native synanthropic species increase to dominate the mammal community. Thresholds were found for abundance of all native terrestrial species combined, macropod abundance and exotic rodent abundance. However, threshold models were only better than linear or cubic models for exotic rodent abundance. Matrix development intensity has a pervasive impact across the whole landscape mosaic that results in a complex range of environmental changes that individually and collectively impact the mammal community. Drawing on all results, I present a conceptual model of the overall impact of matrix development intensity on mammal community integrity. I conclude that a structurally complex matrix within a human-modified landscape can provide supplementary habitat resources and increase the probability of successful species movement across the landscape. Research needs to incorporate empirical data of specific matrix effects into models and theory of species distribution and abundance in human-modified landscapes. This can help guide application of management actions and landscape planning principles across different landscapes. Planning authorities and land managers need to explicitly acknowledge the importance of the matrix and the numerous factors that could be manipulated, such as retention or restoration of a structural vegetation layer that can assist mammal movement across the matrix, for greater landscape-wide conservation outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Matrix</field><field name="subject">landscape mosaic</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">edge</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">urbanisation</field><field name="subject">urban-rural gradient</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Monte Carlo Methods with Applications in Finance</field><field name="creator">Joshua Chi Chun Chan</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to develop novel Monte Carlo techniques with emphasis on various applications in finance and economics, particularly in the fields of risk management and asset returns modeling. New stochastic algorithms are developed for rare-event probability estimation, combinatorial optimization, parameter estimation and model selection. The contributions of this thesis are fourfold. Firstly, we study an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, the Winner Determination Problem (WDP) in combinatorial auctions, where buyers can bid on bundles of items rather than bidding on them sequentially. We present two randomized algorithms, namely, the cross-entropy (CE) method and the ADAptive Mulitilevel splitting (ADAM) algorithm, to solve two versions of the WDP. Although an efficient deterministic algorithm has been developed for one version of the WDP, it is not applicable for the other version considered. In addition, the proposed algorithms are straightforward and easy to program, and do not require specialized software. Secondly, two major applications of conditional Monte Carlo for estimating rare-event probabilities are presented: a complex bridge network reliability model and several generalizations of the widely popular normal copula model used in managing portfolio credit risk. We show how certain efficient conditional Monte Carlo estimators developed for simple settings can be extended to handle complex models involving hundreds or thousands of random variables. In particular, by utilizing an asymptotic description on how the rare event occurs, we derive algorithms that are not only easy to implement, but also compare favorably to existing estimators. Thirdly, we make a contribution at the methodological front by proposing an improvement of the standard CE method for estimation. The improved method is relevant, as recent research has shown that in some high-dimensional settings the likelihood ratio degeneracy problem becomes severe and the importance sampling estimator obtained from the CE algorithm becomes unreliable. In contrast, the performance of the improved variant does not deteriorate as the dimension of the problem increases. Its utility is demonstrated via a high-dimensional estimation problem in risk management, namely, a recently proposed t-copula model for credit risk. We show that even in this high-dimensional model that involves hundreds of random variables, the proposed method performs remarkably well, and compares favorably to existing importance sampling estimators. Furthermore, the improved CE algorithm is then applied to estimating the marginal likelihood, a quantity that is fundamental in Bayesian model comparison and Bayesian model averaging. We present two empirical examples to demonstrate the proposed approach. The first example involves women's labor market participation and we compare three different binary response models in order to find the one best fits the data. The second example utilizes two vector autoregressive (VAR) models to analyze the interdependence and structural stability of four U.S. macroeconomic time series: GDP growth, unemployment rate, interest rate, and inflation. Lastly, we contribute to the growing literature of asset returns modeling by proposing several novel models that explicitly take into account various recent findings in the empirical finance literature. Specifically, two classes of stylized facts are particularly important. The first set is concerned with the marginal distributions of asset returns. One prominent feature of asset returns is that the tails of their distributions are heavier than those of the normal---large returns (in absolute value) occur much more frequently than one might expect from a normally distributed random variable. Another robust empirical feature of asset returns is skewness, where the tails of the distributions are not symmetric---losses are observed more frequently than large gains. The second set of stylized facts is concerned with the dependence structure among asset returns. Recent empirical studies have cast doubts on the adequacy of the linear dependence structure implied by the multivariate normal specification. For example, data from various asset markets, including equities, currencies and commodities markets, indicate the presence of extreme co-movement in asset returns, and this observation is again incompatible with the usual assumption that asset returns are jointly normally distributed. In light of the aforementioned empirical findings, we consider various novel models that generalize the usual normal specification. We develop efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to estimate the proposed models. Moreover, since the number of plausible models is large, we perform a formal Bayesian model comparison to determine the model that best fits the data. In this way, we can directly compare the two approaches of modeling asset returns: copula models and the joint modeling of returns.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">cross entropy method</field><field name="subject">importance sampling</field><field name="subject">conditional Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">Markov chain Monte Carlo</field><field name="subject">rare event simulation</field><field name="subject">Copulas</field><field name="subject">marginal likelihood</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ytterbium-Doped Microsphere Lasers</field><field name="creator">Michael Dalley</field><field name="description">This thesis covers the construction and characterisation of microlasers based on whispering gallery modes in ytterbium-doped microsphere resonators.

Access to whispering gallery modes was accomplished using a prism coupled to the evanescent field of the internal cavity modes. Microspheres with Q-factors of up to 10^7 were made using this technique. CW multimode lasing was observed at 1050 nm, with a pump threshold required for lasing estimated to be of the order of 100 &#956;W for a 900 nm pump. Both TE and TM modes were identified in the laser emission and the ability to selectively excite each mode family (TE or TM) is shown to be directly controlled by the pump. Pulsed lasing was also observed at 975 nm and 1050 nm.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microsphere</field><field name="subject">whispering gallery mode</field><field name="subject">silica</field><field name="subject">ytterbium</field><field name="subject">microlaser</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breaking the Circle of Blame Achieving best practice ecological performance on medium to large scale mixed use precinct developments.</field><field name="creator">Richard Moore</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">12 Built Environment and Design</field><field name="subject">Client/Developer Development Champion Project Manager Process Management, Sustainable Development and Sustainability Quality of Life Framework</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental determinants of sibling similarities and differences in problem behaviour</field><field name="creator">Denise Clague</field><field name="description">This thesis examined the correlates of delinquency and substance use by focusing on the psychosocial environmental influences that lead to sibling similarities and differences in these areas. It was shaped by data from studies strongly suggesting that environmental influences played the most important role in development and adjustment, but that these influences were not shared by siblings in the same family. The evidence for the importance of nonshared environment has led to the conclusion that family variables, such as parenting style and family events, which are shared between siblings, are less important. Adopting this conclusion is highly relevant to the study of the environmental influences that place an adolescent at-risk for problem behaviours, because family variables are important in most sociological treatments of criminal and delinquent behaviour. Therefore, a key issue of this thesis was to investigate the extent of sibling similarity for delinquency and substance use, as well as the significance of a range of variables of theoretical interest in the study of adolescent problem behaviour. A second issue of interest was to determine whether there were associations between differences in sibling experiences and differences in their delinquency and substance use. These issues were examined in 361 primarily opposite-sex adolescent sibling pairs from Wave 1 of the &#8220;Sibling Study&#8221;, a longitudinal study designed to identify those factors that contribute to adolescent engagement in illegal behaviours and those that inhibit such engagement. The design of this study provided several advantages over previous investigations of within-family differences. First, the sample used in the study consisted of siblings at the extremes of the dimensions of problem behaviour rather than based solely on a sample of students, making it possible to investigate the relative influence of shared and nonshared environment at the extremes. Second, a broad set of factors across the domains of school, family, peer, and individual were assessed rather than solely focussing on parental treatment, which is where much research is concentrated. Third, the relationship between shared family context effects and differential experience was considered. Finally, the associations between the correlates of differences for delinquency and substance use were investigated, whereas the relatively small body of previous research on sibling differences has largely ignored substance use. The results indicated substantial within-family differences in experiences of the environment and problem behaviour. Although all siblings differed, sibling pairs where one sibling was identified as an offender or at-risk for offending were significantly more different from one another than siblings identified as normative. Sibling constellation variables were less important in accounting for differential experiences than were the shared family context characteristics. Almost 60% of the variance in sibling delinquency difference scores and 38% of the variance in sibling substance use difference scores could be accounted for by differences in sibling experiences. In general, extra-familial experiences, such as peer influence, school involvement, and stressful events, and individual characteristics, such as self-control, definitions, and attitudes to authority were more important sources of systematic nonshared environment than parental treatment and sibling interaction items. In addition, different patterns were found for low and high risk families, and for delinquency and substance use. These results support the importance of nonshared environmental factors although future research is needed to confirm that these sibling differential experiences are the most important for explaining problem behaviour. The empirical, theoretical, and practical implications of this thesis for the development of problem behaviour were discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delinquency</field><field name="subject">substance use</field><field name="subject">siblings</field><field name="subject">nonshared environment</field><field name="subject">crime theories</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:210159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HEALING IN JUSTICE: An International Study of Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Custodial Experiences of Prison Rehabilitation Programs and the Impact on their Journey from Prison to Community</field><field name="creator">Noritta Morseu-Diop</field><field name="description">Abstract The implementation and delivery of prison rehabilitation programs is crucial to the successful restoration and reintegration of incarcerated people. However, the high recidivism rate nationwide is a clear indication that the current prison programs are not working. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that the core content of most prison-based programs are designed through Western lenses and facilitated predominantly by non-Indigenous program providers. This has greatly impacted on the progression of those Indigenous peoples who come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speak other languages and who have very limited numeracy and literacy levels, hence hindering their rehabilitation and restoration processes. Another factor of concern is the current retributive model of &#8216;correcting&#8217; or prison-for-punishment approach as opposed to a more therapeutic model of &#8216;restoring&#8217; or healing-in-justice approach. The aim of this study is to explore viable ways of achieving rehabilitation and restoration in an effort to address the disproportionate representation of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and M&#257;ori individuals and families in the Queensland and New Zealand criminal justice systems. The study provides the opportunity for Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and M&#257;ori peoples who have been in custody to put forward their voices about the effectiveness or benefits of prison-based programs, and culturally-specific programs offered in Queensland and New Zealand prisons. It also opens up the debate about the importance of utilising culture-as-rehabilitation when dealing with Indigenous people in custody; hence, the voices of Indigenous program providers from Queensland and New Zealand have been instrumental in bringing this issue to the forefront. This research utilised qualitative Indigenous research methodologies and guided by an Indigenous epistemological framework. Whilst a set of informal interview questions guided the process; the use of mir atager or Indigenous yarning modalities was a core aspect of communication during the data collection. With the consent of all participants, the interviews were tape recorded verbatim and analysed thematically with the use of a culturally appropriate colour coding method. In conducting comparative cross-cultural research between Queensland and New Zealand, I was guided by the skills and expertise of an Indigenous research advisor, a cultural supervisor and language interpreters and advisers. Twenty-one Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and M&#257;ori participants shared their stories. The findings arising from the yarnings have identified the cultural inappropriateness of mainstream prison programs and the lack of culturally-specific programs, particularly in the prisons in Queensland. The voices of Indigenous program providers in Queensland also highlighted the lack of Corrective Services recognition for, and accreditation of their programs. A key issue arising from the data is the lack of culturally relevant and gender-specific programs that addresses the special needs of Indigenous women in Queensland and New Zealand prisons. Also arising from the people&#8217;s voices is the need for more pre-release and post-release support to assist in their journey from prison to community. In consideration of the endemic representation of Indigenous peoples in custody as noted above, the research strongly advocates for the funding and establishment of Indigenous-specific prison support services in the community and in the correctional centres to cater for the culturally-specific needs of Indigenous peoples in their journey from prison to community. This research documented the complex and multi-layered issues facing Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islanders and M&#257;ori peoples in the criminal justice system and calls for a more healing-in-justice approach utilising culture-as-rehabilitation methods to correcting the behaviours of Indigenous people who come before the criminal justice system. Last, but not least, the research respects and acknowledges the pain and suffering of those who have been victims of crime, and thereby it is envisaged that the findings of this research will assist in the creation of safer and whole communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Criminal Justice</field><field name="subject">Healing</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Epistemology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:210170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antimicrobial peptides isolated from ovine blood neutrophils : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biotechnology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Rachel C</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions: Anderson, R.C., Wilkinson, B. &amp; Yu, P.L.

Like all things though, incremental and ad hoc improvements to legacy approaches typically lead to reduced quality. It is therefore, essential to periodically review the entire system for holistic effectiveness. For military education, this need is particularly important when the global security environment is experiencing such rapid change. Added to this is the emerging understanding of the &#8216;new sciences&#8217; that provides a unique opportunity to improve cognitive agility when confronting complex adaptive systems. There is also an urgent need to acknowledge and enhance the intangible dimension of professional military education beyond mere content&#8208;centric subject expertise. From the literature on hidden learning and constructivism, there are a number of opportunities available for modernizing the legacy paradigm of professional military education. This study investigated the role of holistic learning (formal, non&#8208;formal, informal, selfdirected, and incidental learning) in the professional development of 29 mid&#8208;career military officers. It involved detailed study of their participation on the seven&#8208;month staff course at the New Zealand Defence College from May to December 2008. Mixed methodology data collection included observations, interviews, questionnaires, focus groups, and document analysis. Analytic procedures ranged from statistical comparisons through to qualitative theme constructs. The study found a number of dimensions (sources and influences) contributing to holistic learning. It also identified a number of opportunities to improve the learning experience. The findings identify a number of important factors in developing strategic artists. Of these, the greatest need is for a strategic plan to extend the current content&#8208;centric syllabus into a full curriculum with intangible traits clearly linked to formal and informal learning activities. Specific components required in this strategic plan include an academic philosophy and a cross&#8208;referencing matrix. The study also recommends reviewing time allocated to cross&#8208;discipline learning of the profession and cognitive agility focused on deep learning. There is also a need to re&#8208;examine the directing staff requirements, management of learner stress, and shaping practical&#8208;value motivation strategies through cultural artefacts. Collectively, the findings recommend shifting from the traditional vessel&#8208;filling paradigm of formal courses to a sociological approach of growing strategic leaders.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Military education</field><field name="subject">Holistic learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::339900 Other Education::339999 Other education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Credibility and validation through syntheses of customary and contemporary knowledge : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies, Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nixon, Marie Ann Zillah</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Nixon, M.

Participatory action research (PAR) was carried out in two communities in the Chi River Basin to answer the inquiries. The research discusses the contexts of the Northeast Region and the two communities in the Chi River Basin. The people in this area are of the Thai-Laos ethnic group and hold particular beliefs in an amalgam of Buddhism and animism which creates cultural rituals that are different from other regions. The society is based on kinship ties. The economic situation has transformed from an agrarian society to a commercial agriculture society. Through the research process the new term of 'grounded civil society' was created. It means 'the sphere of an autonomous group of local people who actively participate in collective action to deal with their struggles and promote their common interests by mobilizing cultural and social capitals in consort with other people to productively solve their problems. Grounded civil society may include traditional forms of mutual assistance, and formal or informal social associations. It seeks to have a significant influence on public policy at any level'. The research found that grounded civil society was activated by both outside and inside factors. The outside factors included the negative effect of government development projects and the intervention of the participatory action research, which stimulated local people to engage in civil society. The inside factors activating civil society were the poor economic conditions of the villagers and the social capital existing in the communities. The social capital was built up around kinship ties and cultural capital, which generated the social values and norms of the local people. The research concluded with an analysis of the causal links between social capital and civil society claiming that social capital facilitated the creation of civil society. Further research possibilities are suggested.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community participation</field><field name="subject">Social capital</field><field name="subject">Customs and rituals, Thailand</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370108 Rural Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting fourth form girls' participation and achievement in design and technology subjects in selected secondary schools of Zimbwabwe : a case study exploration : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chimwayange, Christopher Crispen</field><field name="description">Paging jumps from viii to xi.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Girls' secondary education</field><field name="subject">Design and technology education</field><field name="subject">Sex discrimination in education</field><field name="subject">Education, Zimbabwe</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breaking another silence : the long-term impacts of child sexual abuse on committed lesbian couples : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hanna, Sue</field><field name="description">This qualitative research enquiry sought to develop an understanding from forty-four women, comprising twenty-two couples in committed lesbian partnerships, of how they managed the long-term impacts of child sexual abuse, both on themselves and on their relationships. This is an area that is under- theorised in the literature. A number of key findings emerged from the analysis. The sexual abuse that women had experienced had impacted their adult lives in various ways. Of these the personal aspect featured most highly, with feelings of self-blame, shame and low self esteem commonly reported. Those women who reported physically invasive sexual abuse also reported a wider variety of effects, and in proportionately greater numbers, than women whose abusive experience had not encompassed that particular dimension. Just as the survivors were impacted in a variety of ways by their abuse, so too were their partners, although the effects upon the partner varied over time and in intensity depending on the length of the relationship and the degree of resolution experienced by the survivor. Despite challenges the over all view of couple relationships was positive, and couples were able to articulate coping strategies they felt would be useful to others in similar circumstances. Partners were able to identify with many of the relationship issues outlined by heterosexual male partners of female survivors, although lesbian partners had more a positive view of counselling. The emotional support and commitment of a caring partner was clearly valued although in these partnerships both women wanted their relationship to be based on more than the reparative needs of one member. Finally, being lesbian was no barrier to seeking counselling assistance. A large proportion of the participants had used counselling as a way of working through their experiences of child sexual abuse and had found this to be valuable. These findings have implications for social work practice with child and adult female survivors. They emphasise the long term impacts of sexual abuse, the important contributions made by partners and counsellors in supporting women sexually abused as children and the levels of inter-sibling sexual abuse perpetrated by brothers. The research findings also contain information from the women themselves on what facilitated their ability to cope with the effects of child sexual abuse from the varying perspectives of survivor, partner and couple. This will be essential information for counsellors and social workers wishing to employ strengths and evidence-based approaches in their work with this client group and others, particularly heterosexual women and heterosexual couples.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult child sexual abuse victims</field><field name="subject">Coping</field><field name="subject">Counselling and support</field><field name="subject">Lesbian relationships</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370204 Counselling , welfare and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To stop or not to stop? - Investigating the differential effects of two self-control stategies on self-regulatory resource depletion</field><field name="creator">Li, Alex Sai Hoi</field><field name="description">PhD</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marketing</field><field name="subject">consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">self-regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depictions of Thailand in Australian and Thai writings:Reflections of the Self and Other</field><field name="creator">Pissa-ard, Isaraporn</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Modern Australian literature</field><field name="subject">Modern Thai literature</field><field name="subject">Literature and society</field><field name="subject">Australian and Thai literature</field><field name="subject">Australian and Thai society</field><field name="subject">Thai literature</field><field name="subject">Australian and Thai literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using scenario planning to identify potential impacts of socio-demographic change on aspects of domestic tourism demand in Queensland in 2021</field><field name="creator">Glover, Petra Sabine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism -- Supply and demand -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of whiteness in Australia: Discourses of immigration and national identity from the White Australia Policy to multiculturalism</field><field name="creator">Ganley, Nathan Tobias</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Australia policy -- History</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concept of an archipelagic state and its implementation in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Puspitawati, Dhiana</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Pathways for Elite Coaching: A Study of Australian Softball Coaches</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Horton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the attributes and experiences that are perceived priorities for recruitment to become a high performance coach in the sport of Softball in Australia. The study was undertaken in the form of 10 cases of nationally identified coaches and administrators (men and women). Each participant was interviewed using semi-structured questions. The interpretive study gave an intensive description and analysis of coach experiences, attributes and qualifications that are perceived as highly desirable for coach selection by Softball Australia for high performance coaches. The basis for collection and analysis of information was via individual cognitive perspectives and perceptions (through interviews) and individual behaviours (through observation) with the intention to interpret and consider the presence of common themes. Findings may serve to identify, support and direct potential high performance coaches and contribute to the effectiveness of formal coaching education programs. The study focused on the sport of softball which has had a mixed profile over time, from one of almost obscurity to that of an Olympic sport. Australia has had an extremely impressive record internationally. It is currently ranked as the world&#8217;s best softball nation based on international performances by the Australian under 19 Men, Open Men, under 19 Women and Open Women&#8217;s Teams (SA 2008). Australia was the only country ranked in the top three in all age groups competing in World Championships. The importance of this study to softball coaches was to encapsulate the reality of how selectors make determination on performance coaching selections, and was this in line with what performance coaches perceive as the priorities. This may have two direct effects on the performance coach. Firstly, it may allow the coach to develop a career path that may best suit their qualities and attributes. Secondly, it may allow the coach to undertake further learning and development in the areas that the selectors perceive the coach does not meet the required standard of merit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elite sports coaching, career pathways, Australian softball</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calcium influx regulators in mammary gland development and breast cancer: Roles of ORAI and STIM isoforms</field><field name="creator">Damara McAndrew</field><field name="description">Calcium is the major mineral component of milk and is essential for neonatal development. To enrich the milk, calcium must pass from the maternal bloodstream, through mammary epithelial cells, into the alveolar lumen. While calcium extrusion from the epithelial cells is well characterized, no calcium channel or transporter has been identified as the major conduit for calcium to enter the mammary epithelial cell from the bloodstream. A major aim of this thesis was to identify a calcium channel or channels responsible for calcium influx into mammary epithelial cells during lactation. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate in vivo expression of calcium channels in the murine mammary gland at the four main stages of mammary gland development. The store-operated calcium channel Orai1 was upregulated during lactation relative to its expression in the nulliparous gland. The classic ORAI1 regulator Stim1 was not similarly overexpressed during lactation, however, its isoform Stim2 was modestly upregulated. HC11 murine mammary cells were used as a model to further investigate the role of STIM2 on calcium handling during lactation. siRNA knockdown of Stim2 reduced both basal and agonist-induced peak cytosolic calcium levels, indicative of its role in calcium regulation. In addition to investigating the role of calcium channels in normal mammary development, their role in breast cancer was examined. Real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to identify calcium channels upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines, relative to non-tumorigenic mammary cell lines. TRPV1, TRPV6, and ORAI1 were upregulated in the breast cancer cell lines. Pharmacological modulation of ORAI1 resulted in modest changes in proliferation, but as there was no specific ORAI1 inhibitor, this effect could not be conclusively attributed to ORAI1 inhibition. siRNA was used to specifically target ORAI1 in three human breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and T-47D. siRNA knockdown of ORAI1 was specific and potent, and reduced cell viability and altered calcium handing in all three cell lines. The alterations caused by ORAI1 knock down were not related to the expression of the genes CDK2 and FOS, as these did not change upon ORAI1 knockdown. Data mining was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information&#8217;s (NCBI&#8217;s) expressed sequence tag (EST) database, dbEST, and the Oncomine database. ORAI1 was elevated in estrogen receptor negative breast cancers and in the basal breast cancer molecular subtype, a subtype that has a poor prognosis. Other data suggested that breast cancer cells with high STIM1 and low STIM2 expression also correlated with the basal breast cancer subtype. These data indicate that ORAI and STIM proteins have a role in the physiological process of lactation as well as in the regulation of tumorigenic pathways in the breast, and particular gene expression profiles may be predictors of disease prognosis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calcium</field><field name="subject">breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Lactation</field><field name="subject">mammary gland</field><field name="subject">ORAI1</field><field name="subject">STIM2</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maintaining Global Consistency in Advanced Database Systems</field><field name="creator">John Gilmore</field><field name="description">The thesis examines issues of consistency maintenance in advanced database systems; primarily, multidatabase systems. A multidatabase system consists of a number of pre-existing local database systems. A local database system is unaware of its participation in the multidatabase system and, likewise, the multidatabase system has no knowledge of local transaction executions. Enforcing global constraints in such an environment is clearly a challenging task. A methodology for constraint enforcement is presented which utilises existing technology for the replication of data in an attempt to enforce global consistency. While it is shown to have limited applicability, it is nonetheless an interesting study and serves to qualify the limits of such a solution. An alternative method for global consistency maintenance, which relies on the existence of triggers at each of the participant local databases, is then discussed. This method is shown to be particularly suitable when the issue of local database autonomy is of concern. It is, however, only suited to systems where each of the local databases provides a capability for triggering external actions based on the occurrence of particular database events. As a result of this methodology, the requirement for identification of enforcement actions which access sites where the instigating transaction originated becomes apparent. Such enforcement actions can cause deadlock in certain circumstances when they are executed at the same site which initially triggered the global constraint. This issue is dealt with in a novel way by proposing a methodology for statically checking relations at each participant site with a view to determining their susceptibility to this form of deadlock. The method, a graphical representation of the constraint enforcement process in a distributed system, is also shown to have other desirable properties. Arising from the requirements of other work within the thesis, an algorithm for detecting all cycles in a given directed graph is presented. It is shown that, while the well-known adaptation of the Depth First Search algorithm to cycle detection in directed graphs can detect the existence of cycles, it cannot in all circumstances identify all cycles. An algorithm which performs this task is presented together with an analysis of its complexity and correctness. In a more general sense, the issue of deferred constraint enforcement is discussed. Several scenarios where deferred enforcement of constraints is required are presented, together with a method for detecting the presence of cyclic dependencies within a given database schema.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multidatabase</field><field name="subject">constraint management</field><field name="subject">global constraint</field><field name="subject">database management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional Development through CoPs: A Case Study of EFL Teachers in China</field><field name="creator">Ping Wang</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were to investigate tertiary English language teachers&#8217; needs, experiences, and expectations for PD in oral English discussion strategies, to develop a transformative model of professional development using a CoP framework, and to consider how teachers transformed their learning through completing this PD program. To achieve these aims, a case study was designed that used both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to collect data from multiple sources. Data were collected from: (1) a questionnaire of 30 EFL teachers in the English department of a Chinese university; and (2) interviews with four teachers who volunteered to participate in the CoP; and (3) audio transcriptions of ten professional development meetings, blogs and follow-up electronic interviews six months later. These data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The key findings from the analysis of the teacher PD questionnaires and preliminary interview responses showed that although the English teachers in the research site lacked PD experience, they had positive perceptions and expectations for PD activities. However, it was found that PD activities that the respondents had previous attended had been mainly trainer-centred and not relevant to their actual classroom teaching. The teachers reported a need for more opportunities to work with their peers in groups, and for professional development more closely aligned with their needs that considered their other professional commitments and workloads. Based on these findings, a PD program using a Communities of Practice framework was designed to assist teachers to develop new strategies for teaching English oral language skills. Analysis of the transcripts from the PD meetings, post-PD interviews, and electronic interviews revealed that the process of PD implementation was more complex than the initial framework had suggested. First, the outcomes after the implementation of the model varied more than anticipated. The teachers negotiated meanings to enable them to introduce new practices, persisted with their old practice, and adapted, rather than directly adopting, activities. Second, the teachers&#8217; change in practice was smaller than anticipated. Third, the teacher change related to thinking as well as practice. The PD model using a CoP framework was then refined and extended based on these findings. The study also reported an individual case study of one participant&#8217;s (Yang&#8217;s) learning in the PD program. It was found that Yang went through a significant evolution in her learning. She came to the program as an &#8220;outsider&#8221; and a listener who was willing to learn new practice from the other teachers. She experienced various cycles during which she implemented what she learned in the meetings and achieved transformation, which included both adaptation and adoption of new strategies in her teaching. The findings revealed that the process of teacher transformative learning in a CoP was complex, cyclical and requires further facilitation and extended participation in face-to-face group activities. Implications were drawn from these findings about directions for future research including: further research in the Chinese context for deeper understanding of teacher transformative learning in PD, and further research on implementing the model in other contexts to explore teachers transformative PD and to investigate the possibility of extending this model to a larger context. This study is an example of how a professional development model using a Community of Practice framework could be implemented for EFL teacher transformative learning in one Chinese university. The study proposed a model, then refined and extended this model which might be applied to other research contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Teacher professional development, Communities of Practice, China, EFL teacher</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational study of proteins with paramagnetic NMR: Automatic assignments of spectral resonances, determination of protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes, and structure determination of proteins</field><field name="creator">Christophe Schmitz</field><field name="description">Understanding biological phenomena at atomic resolution is one of the keys to modern drug design. In particular, knowledge of 3D structures of proteins and their interactions with other macromolecules are necessary for designing chemical compounds that modify biological processes. Conventional methods for protein structure determinations comprise X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These techniques can also determine the binding mode of chemical compounds. Either technique can be slow and costly, making it highly relevant to explore alternative strategies. Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy is emerging as such an alternative technique. In order to measure the paramagnetic effects, two NMR spectra are compared that have been measured with and without a bound paramagnetic metal ion. In particular, pseudocontact shifts (PCS) of nuclear spins are easily measured as the difference (in ppm) of the chemical shifts between the two spectra. PCSs provide long range and orientation dependent restraints, allowing positioning of the spin with respect to the magnetic susceptibility tensor anisotropy (&#916;&#967;-tensor) of the metal ion. In this thesis, I used the PCS effect to computationally extract information from NMR spectra. I developed (i) a tool (called Possum) to automatically assign diamagnetic and paramagnetic spectra of the methyl groups of amino acid side chains, given structural information of the protein studied and prior knowledge of the &#916;&#967;-tensor; (ii) I designed a comprehensive software package (called Numbat) to extract &#916;&#967;-tensor parameters from assigned PCS values and the available 3D structure; and (iii) I incorporated PCS-based restraints into the protein structure prediction software CS-ROSETTA and demonstrated that this combination (PCS-ROSETTA) presents a significant improvement for de novo structure determination. The three projects serve different purposes at different stages of protein NMR studies. They could be combined in the following manner: Starting from assigned backbone PCSs, PCS-Rosetta could be used to determine the 3D structure of the protein. Possum can then be used to automatically assign the NMR resonances of the methyl groups using PCSs. Finally, Numbat can be used to fit improved &#916;&#967;-tensors to all the PCS data, analyze the quality of the &#916;&#967;-tensors and identify possible wrong assignments. Iterative repetition of this protocol would give a 3D structural model of the protein with a minimum of data. Alternatively, the &#916;&#967;-tensor parameters and PCSs could be used as input for a traditional software package such as Xplor-NIH to compute a 3D structure of the protein.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">paramagnetic NMR</field><field name="subject">pseudocontact shift</field><field name="subject">Lanthanide</field><field name="subject">magnetic susceptibility tensor</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">Structure Determination</field><field name="subject">resonance assignment</field><field name="subject">Protein Folding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrical Properties, Tunability and Applications of Superconducting Metal-Mixed Polymers</field><field name="creator">Andrew Stephenson</field><field name="description">We investigate the newly discovered, superconducting metal-mixed polymers made by embedding a surface layer of metal (a tin-antimony alloy) into a plastic substrate (polyetheretherketone - PEEK). Focusing initially on pre-implanted systems, we show that while the substrate morphology does affect the distribution of metal deposited on the surface, the morphology has no affect on the film's electrical properties. We find that the metal content can be characterised via the film's optical absorption, which along with the conductivity, scales with thickness. By conducting low temperature resistivity measurements we observe that the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, remains at that of bulk Sn but the transition broadens with decreasing film thickness. Studying N-implanted metal-mixed polymers, we find that the implant temperature can influence the electrical properties of these systems, as higher implant temperatures result in greater disorder, which in turn causes higher residual resistances and broader superconducting transitions. We observe peaks in the magnetoresistance of superconducting/insulating systems, which we attribute to the competition between superconductivity and weak localisation in a granular network. We determine that the substrate morphology does not influence the electrical properties of implanted systems. We investigate the role sputtering plays by implanting heavier ions (Sn) and show that this technique can be used to overcome the issue of inhomogeneity inherent with using thinner initial films. We study the effect the fabrication parameters of implant dose, beam energy and film thickness have on Sn-implanted metal-mixed polymers and find that with only minor changes in the fabrication conditions, it is possible to tune the conductivities of these materials between a zero-resistance superconducting state, through a metal-insulator transition, to a severely insulating state ($R_s &gt; 10^{10}~\Omega/\Box$). We find that the electrical properties can be further controlled by annealing the samples, and that it is possible to induce optical changes at temperatures approaching the glass transition temperature of PEEK. We demonstrate that metal-mixed polymers are suitable for use in resistance-based temperature sensors by comparing their performance directly against commercially available products and find that the metal-mixed polymers perform at least as well as the commercial models and, indeed, pass the highest industry standards.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superconductivity</field><field name="subject">ion-implantation</field><field name="subject">conducting polymers</field><field name="subject">soft electronics</field><field name="subject">metal-mixing</field><field name="subject">thermometers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMPROVED COMPUTATIONAL AND EMPIRICAL MODELS OF HYDROCYCLONES</field><field name="creator">Narasimha Mangadoddy</field><field name="description">The principal objectives of the work described in this thesis were: 1. To develop an improved multiphase CFD model for classifying cyclones and further improve understanding of the separation mechanism based on fluid flow and turbulence inside the cyclone. 2. To develop an improved Empirical model of classifying cyclones, covering a wide range of design and operating conditions. The multi-phase CFD model developed in this work is based on the approach reported by Brennan et al (2002) and Brennan (2003) using Fluent, and involves individual models for the air-core, turbulence, and particle classification. Two-phase VOF and mixture models for an air/water system were used to predict the air-core and the pressure and flow fields on 3D fitted fine grids. The turbulence was resolved using both DRSM (QPS) and LES turbulence models. The predicted mean and turbulent flow field from the LES and DRSM turbulence models were compared with the LDA measurements of Hsieh (1988). The LES model predicts the experimental data more accurately than the DRSM model. The standard mixture model (Manninnen et al, 1996) and the modified mixture model for a water/air/solids system were used to predict cyclone performance. The standard mixture model was able to predict classification efficiency reasonably at low solids concentrations, but under-predicts the recovery of coarse size fractions to underflow. To improve the predictions at moderate to high feed solids, the author modified the slip velocity with additional Bagnold dispersive forces, Saffman lift forces, and a hindered settling correction for particle drag in the mixture model superimposed on an LES turbulence model. Several cyclone geometries were used for validating the multiphase CFD model. The modified mixture model improves prediction of the separation of coarse size particles, and the predicted closely matches the experimental in various cyclones. The particle classification mechanism has been further elucidated using the simulated particle concentration distributions. At high solids concentrations, the modified CFD model predicts the efficiency curve reasonably well, especially the cut-size of the cyclone, but prediction of fine particle recovery to overflow is poor compared to the experimental data. It appears that the fines are significantly affected by turbulent dispersion and the flow resistance due to the high viscosity of the slurry at the apex is not sufficiently accounted for in the modified Mixture model. The improved multi-phase CFD model was validated against two sets of experimental data available in the literature: particle concentrations measured by gamma ray tomography data in a dense medium cyclone (Subramanian, 2002), and particle size distribution inside a hydrocyclone (Renner, 1976). Large eddy simulation (LES) with the modified Mixture model, including medium with a feed size distribution appears to be promising in predicting medium segregation inside a dense medium cyclone. The CFD predicted sample size distributions at different positions are reasonably comparable with Renner&#8217;s (1976) experimental data near the wall and in the bottom cone, but differ considerably near the forced vortex region, and also near the tip of the vortex finder wall. The CFD model shows no air-core formation at the low operating pressure used by Renner, which suggests his experiments involved an unusual/unstable forced vortex based cyclone separation. The effect of turbulence on fluid and solid particle motion was also studied in this thesis. The resolved turbulent fluctuations from LES of the hydrocyclone at steady flow were analysed using ensemble averaging. The ratio of the effective turbulent acceleration of each particle size to the centrifugal acceleration was calculated for various cyclones, which showed that turbulent mixing becomes less important with larger particles. The trends in this ratio correlate with the equilibrium positions of the particles from the multiphase LES. The analysis indicates that the short-circuiting might be aggravated by turbulent mixing across the locus of zero vertical velocity (LZVV) against the classification force, and along the vortex finder wall into the inner upflow region of the cyclone. An experimental study of the &#8220;fish-hook&#8221; effect was pursued in various industrial scale cyclones to evaluate the effect of various cyclone parameters. The observed diameter at which fine particle recovery starts to increase is mainly affected by feed solids content and spigot diameter, but less influenced by feed pressure. The observed particle recovery to the underflow at the fishhook dip size, the bypass, is always higher than the underflow water split. Any cyclone variable that affects the underflow water split, will also affect the bypass value. CFD studies showing high particle Reynolds numbers for coarse particles were used to provide a qualitative mechanism for fines reporting to the underflow in the wakes behind the larger particles (Tang et all. 1992). The Frachon and Cilliers (1999) model was used to fit and evaluate the fishhook parameters. The variations of these fishhook parameters were quantified for changes in cyclone design and operating conditions. The development of an improved empirical hydrocyclone model was attempted by collecting extensive historical data covering a wide range of cyclones. Additional experiments on 10 and 20 inch Krebs cyclones were performed to fill the gaps in the database, especially at low to moderate feed solids concentration and with different cone sections. Tangential velocity, turbulent diffusion, slurry viscosity and particle hindered settling correlations were identified from CFD as the key inputs to the particle classification mechanism for the empirical model. A new cyclone model structure based on a dimensionless approach has been developed. The model for , , Q gives a very good fit to the data, while the model for separation sharpness gave reasonable correlations with the cyclone design and operating conditions. 208 additional data sets were used to validate the new hydrocyclone model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">04 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Hydrocyclones, Classification, Computational Fluid dynamics, Turbulence, Mixture model,</field><field name="subject">Fish-hook, dispersion, Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HEALING IN JUSTICE: An International Study of Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Custodial Experiences of Prison Rehabilitation Programs and the Impact on their Journey from Prison to Community</field><field name="creator">Noritta Morseu-Diop</field><field name="description">Abstract The implementation and delivery of prison rehabilitation programs is crucial to the successful restoration and reintegration of incarcerated people. However, the high recidivism rate nationwide is a clear indication that the current prison programs are not working. Furthermore, it is common knowledge that the core content of most prison-based programs are designed through Western lenses and facilitated predominantly by non-Indigenous program providers. This has greatly impacted on the progression of those Indigenous peoples who come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speak other languages and who have very limited numeracy and literacy levels, hence hindering their rehabilitation and restoration processes. Another factor of concern is the current retributive model of &#8216;correcting&#8217; or prison-for-punishment approach as opposed to a more therapeutic model of &#8216;restoring&#8217; or healing-in-justice approach. The aim of this study is to explore viable ways of achieving rehabilitation and restoration in an effort to address the disproportionate representation of Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and M&#257;ori individuals and families in the Queensland and New Zealand criminal justice systems. The study provides the opportunity for Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and M&#257;ori peoples who have been in custody to put forward their voices about the effectiveness or benefits of prison-based programs, and culturally-specific programs offered in Queensland and New Zealand prisons. It also opens up the debate about the importance of utilising culture-as-rehabilitation when dealing with Indigenous people in custody; hence, the voices of Indigenous program providers from Queensland and New Zealand have been instrumental in bringing this issue to the forefront. This research utilised qualitative Indigenous research methodologies and guided by an Indigenous epistemological framework. Whilst a set of informal interview questions guided the process; the use of mir atager or Indigenous yarning modalities was a core aspect of communication during the data collection. With the consent of all participants, the interviews were tape recorded verbatim and analysed thematically with the use of a culturally appropriate colour coding method. In conducting comparative cross-cultural research between Queensland and New Zealand, I was guided by the skills and expertise of an Indigenous research advisor, a cultural supervisor and language interpreters and advisers. Twenty-one Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and M&#257;ori participants shared their stories. The findings arising from the yarnings have identified the cultural inappropriateness of mainstream prison programs and the lack of culturally-specific programs, particularly in the prisons in Queensland. The voices of Indigenous program providers in Queensland also highlighted the lack of Corrective Services recognition for, and accreditation of their programs. A key issue arising from the data is the lack of culturally relevant and gender-specific programs that addresses the special needs of Indigenous women in Queensland and New Zealand prisons. Also arising from the people&#8217;s voices is the need for more pre-release and post-release support to assist in their journey from prison to community. In consideration of the endemic representation of Indigenous peoples in custody as noted above, the research strongly advocates for the funding and establishment of Indigenous-specific prison support services in the community and in the correctional centres to cater for the culturally-specific needs of Indigenous peoples in their journey from prison to community. This research documented the complex and multi-layered issues facing Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islanders and M&#257;ori peoples in the criminal justice system and calls for a more healing-in-justice approach utilising culture-as-rehabilitation methods to correcting the behaviours of Indigenous people who come before the criminal justice system. Last, but not least, the research respects and acknowledges the pain and suffering of those who have been victims of crime, and thereby it is envisaged that the findings of this research will assist in the creation of safer and whole communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous</field><field name="subject">Criminal Justice</field><field name="subject">Healing</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Epistemology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:210170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I walked with a Zombie : readings of Robbe-Grillet and Joyce informing a practice in contemporary sculpture and installation /</field><field name="creator">Best, Andrew</field><field name="description">Commentary on the visual arts in the past decades has noted a shift towards a 'return to narrative', particularly in relation to painting, photography and video, but also media where narrative concerns have perhaps been marginalised, namely contemporary installation and sculpture.

name="title">Whakapapa and the state: some case studies in the impact of central government on traditionally organised M&#257;ori groups</field><field name="creator">Carter, Lynette Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis examines modern iwi governance systems and their effect on whakapapa as an organisational framework in M&#257;ori societies. The main question addressed was; can whakapapa survive as an organisational process, or will it be stifled, as M&#257;ori societies struggle to establish a strong identity in contemporary New Zealand. As an organisational framework for M&#257;ori societies, whakapapa works through a series of principles that function through relationships between people, and between people and other elements that make up the world. Contemporary M&#257;ori groups continue to claim that they are whakapapa-based societies. This thesis examines that claim by investigating to what extent of "being M&#257;ori" today is about adherence to those principles and to whakapapa-based processes and relationships, and how much is it about being shaped by non-M&#257;ori constructs that have been formed by state-intervention and legislated changes to M&#257;ori social organisation. If being Maori today has as much or more to do with the latter, what place does whakapapa have in contemporary M&#257;ori society, and to what level and to what extent can the principles of whakapapa be upheld as the basis for contemporary M&#257;ori societies. A series of stories and case studies were used to answer the questions posed in the thesis. The case studies demonstrated the ways in which whakapapa worked in everyday situations, and how the people who take part in whakapapa-based relationships understood them to work. They also demonstrated how state intervention through legislation has challenged the way M&#257;ori groups structure themselves when new circumstances have required compromise and change. The institutionalised evolution of M&#257;ori societies is examined in more detail using one example of a modern tribal structure, Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu. The Ng&#257;i Tahu example typifies the implications for M&#257;ori if they choose to move from a whakapapa-based organisational model of governance to a centralised legalbureaucratic model of governance. The adoption of the new centralised governance structures, such as Te R&#363;nanga o Ng&#257;i Tahu, will mean that M&#257;ori hap&#363; and iwi societies are in danger of disappearing to be replaced by a generic group,shaped by legislation and integrated into the wider nation-state of New Zealand. Whakapapa can only remain at the core of M&#257;ori societies, if M&#257;ori allow it to, but when M&#257;ori adopt centralised "generic" system of governance, hap&#363; and iwi societies, become censored versions of their former selves.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface-immobilized hairpin DNA sensors for direct and specific detection of target DNA</field><field name="creator">Kja&#776;llman, Tanja</field><field name="description">Gene-sensors show great promise as tools for various applications, such as clinical diagnosis, reliable forensic analysis, environmental monitoring, and biological research. There is a great demand for DNA sensors that are able to detect single-base mismatches, which are the most common genetic defects that need to be discriminated for medical diagnostic purposes. The development of label free, direct, and fast sensors can be essential in meeting that requirement. Current gene-sensing technology relies heavily on fluorescent labeling of samples but this approach suffers from the disadvantage of time-consuming, expensive and multi-stepped procedures, especially during the sample preparation stage. Although the use of fluorescent labels has overcome the hazards involved with radioactive markers, development of alternative approaches to the traditional assays is still vital to advance the area of DNA sensors. The aim of this research was to develop a one-step sensor, offering direct and specific detection of a target DNA. Nanostructured materials, such as quantum dots (QDs) and self-assembled monolayers, together with hairpin structured DNA probes were applied and investigated for optical as well as electrochemical sensors. The properties of inorganic quantum dots (or nanoparticles), such as narrow and intensive emission spectra, resistance to photobleaching and a wide range of possible surface functionalities, give QDs a great potential as labels in biological sensing applications. Self-assembled monolayers provide well established and versatile platforms for biosensors and hairpin probes, which are able to discriminate single-base mismatches in the target sequences, are ideal components for DNA sensors. Generally, the electrochemical sensors demonstrated a superior response compared to the optical sensors. The best prepared sensor showed sensitivity down to 4.7 fM of target and was capable of detecting single-base mismatches, fulfilling the requirements for a high-quality DNA sensor.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Academic target setting : Formative use of achievement data</field><field name="creator">Smith, Samantha Lynn</field><field name="description">Improving student achievement is an ongoing challenge for schools with a great deal of data collected to ascertain improvement trends. In this thesis, possibilities for using this achievement data to improve outcomes for students, through establishing academic achievement targets was explored. Longitudinal achievement data were collected about students, over time and analysed for patterns and trends. This information was then used to formulate individual academic achievement targets for students in Year 9 and Year 11. All the academic targets for the students incorporated an element of challenge and were intended to lift individual student performance but were not designed to be predictive. The targets (specifying standards, credits and levels of achievement) were then shared with students as part of an academic counselling programme. The study also explored classroom teachers&#8217; experiences of the target setting process in the subject areas of English and mathematics. The results indicated statistically significant higher achievement outcomes for students with academic targets compared to those without such targets. The students involved in the intervention were 1.9 times more likely to gain the Level 1 National Certificate of Educational Achievement, than those students not in the intervention, when controlling for prior achievement, ethnicity and gender variables. In addition, being part of the intervention allowed those students who entered the school with a significantly lower intake score (as measured by the Middle Years Information System (MidYIS)) to be more successful in gaining the Level 1 Certificate, than students in previous years. The quality of achievement in Year 11 was also improved as measured by a grade point score in the subjects of English and mathematics. The study demonstrated the benefits of the systematic use of longitudinal achievement data as a basis for establishing achievement targets for students. The teachers reported that discussing the targets with students helped improve relationships between themselves and the students. However, the provision of targets did not change teaching practices and in some cases created an element of tension when teachers&#8217; expectations of students conflicted with the targets established through the models explained in the early parts of the study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5863</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lay magistracy in New Zealand: judicial asset or colonial anachronism?</field><field name="creator">Harkness, Philip Vaughan</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the concept of lay magistracy &#8211; what it is, how it developed, and why it is considered to be important. It also explores whether or not the service should be dissolved, retained and expanded, or revised. Lay magistracy performance was evaluated and New Zealand roles were compared with other jurisdictions to determine whether or not the New Zealand system could be labelled as &#8216;effective&#8217;.1 Overseas reviews of lay magistracy were used to critique the New Zealand context. A review of the literature indicated that while lay magistracy was languishing in New Zealand it was progressing in overseas jurisdictions. In order to determine whether or not lay magistracy represents an effective judicial instrument that should be retained, reformed or jettisoned, a mixed-mode methodological approach was used. This involved working with a group of selected JP officials, and a focus group, to identify core issues that could be seen as potential threats to a viable and effective lay magistracy. This preliminary research affirmed the need for a nationwide qualitative and quantitative survey of the JP population. The results of this survey (&#931;N = 630 responses from 993 sampled) revealed a healthy and viable lay magistracy anxious to continue serving the community but frustrated by apparent government disinterest in extending their judicial activities. Most respondents saw themselves as active in JP duties, felt they now received better training, and thought membership of JP associations should be compulsory. A majority were opposed to the political appointment process and favoured the introduction of non-partisan selection procedures. Further comparative research involved a critical examination of aspects of New Zealand&#8217;s lay magistracy by comparing and contrasting them with those of other countries. Arguments for and against the principle and practical use of lay magistracy were then advanced. It is concluded that a relative absence of New Zealand studies is problematic but a mixed method approach provides a suitable approach for future studies. This research is the first major survey of the JP population in New Zealand. It provides demographic descriptors of the JP body and information about their views and opinions. Such data have not previously been available and now need to be extended. Rather than being anachronistic, this thesis affirms that lay magistracy is effective and should be retained and reformed as a major component of the New Zealand judicial system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5932</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional supervision practice under new public management : a study of the perspectives of probation officers and service managers in the community probation service : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Social Policy and Social Work, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">O'Donoghue, Kieran Barry</field><field name="description">This thesis examines professional supervision practice under new public management from the perspectives of probation officers and service managers in the Community Probation Service. In particular, the research explores the participants&#8217; philosophy of professional supervision, their recent supervision experiences, and their aspirations and expectations with regard to professional supervision. In order to provide a background for an informed analysis and discussion of the research findings, the thesis discusses the key themes in the social service supervision and new public management literature. It also examines the Community Probation Service&#8217;s context and the history of new public management and professional supervision in this organisation. The thesis is a qualitative study that is informed by social work practice theory and utilises the phenomenological and hermeneutic approaches. The research findings show that amongst the participants there was: (a) an unclear philosophy of supervision; (b) minimal recent experience of supervision and little ownership or support for the agency supervision project; (c) a belief that the context increased their need for supervision, but at the same time reduced their ability to receive or participate in it; (d) an expectation that professional supervision would assist them to work more effectively with clients and staff; (e) an expectation of good committed supervisors who would support and help them develop; and (f) an expectation that the agency would support professional supervision through resourcing, guidelines, accredited supervisors and the establishment of a learning culture. The major implications of these findings are that: (1) there is a need for staff to be socialised into professional social service supervision; (2) that the professional supervision programme within the Community Probation Service, as currently implemented, is unlikely to be successful; and (3) that professional social service supervision needs to be focused upon persons and their environments, rather than upon the agency.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Probation officers</field><field name="subject">Professional supervision</field><field name="subject">Social service supervision</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390400 Law Enforcement::390405 Correctional theory and services; penology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The usage of traditional Maori narratives as cognitive models and educational tools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Benavides, Sebastian Pelayo</field><field name="description">The present research consists of an interdisciplinary approach which combines mainly sub-disciplines from the anthropological and psychological perspectives as theoretical background. Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology. Being a research stemmed from an anthropological concern &#8211;how do people from different sociocultural backgrounds construct and transmit knowledge- it considered as a fundamental element an empirical or &#8220;fieldwork&#8221; approach to the matter. Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study. A period of complementary participant observation was also carried out, focusing on the pedagogical practises and styles of the participant teachers. Through this, the research aims to contextualise the bibliographical and theoretical findings, considering the contemporary applications, limitations and understandings encountered through concrete experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">construction and transmission of knowledge</field><field name="subject">Maori folklore</field><field name="subject">Maori stories</field><field name="subject">cognitive models</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the construction of social work supervision in Aotearoa New Zealand : a study of the perspectives of social work practitioners and supervisors : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">O'Donoghue, Kieran Barry</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the construction of social work supervision from the perspectives of social work practitioners and supervisors. In particular, the research explored how social work supervision was constructed, the influence of the Aotearoa New Zealand context upon its construction, and where and how social work supervision can most effectively be improved. In order to provide a background for informed analysis and discussion of the research findings, key themes within the international and Aoteaoroa New Zealand supervision literature were discussed. The thesis was a mixed methods study that was informed by a constructionist conceptual framework with regard to the framing and exploration of the research questions. The methodological approach used was derived from pragmatism and involved a combination of survey research with qualitative individual interviews, with the survey being used to recruit and purposefully select participants for the individual interviews. The key findings from the study were: a) social work supervision was predominantly constructed from a professional standpoint, with the social, organisational and interpersonal context influencing how supervision was produced in any setting at anytime; b) the Aotearoa New Zealand context influenced supervision through the discourses of biculturalism and indigenous development, with multiculturalism being a secondary influence; and c) that improvements were needed in the professional and organisational systems that support supervision as well as in the practice and provision of it. The implications and recommendations arising from these findings focus on social work supervision theory and practice, cultural competence and the further development of professional supervision. From these implications it is suggested that the future research and development agenda for social work supervision both internationally and within Aotearoa New Zealand concerns theory-building, responding to the dynamics of culture and difference within supervision and the professionalisation of supervision. The recommendations related to the professionalisation of supervision concern: formal education and training; the role of supervision within organisations and contribution to organisational development; and the need for a stronger evidence-base regarding supervision&#8217;s contribution to client practice and social worker well-being and development.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social work supervision</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced nursing practice and the nurse practitioner : New Zealand nursing's professional project in the late 20th century : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, Susan Haas</field><field name="description">Page 251 is missing from original but content appears complete.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing history</field><field name="subject">Nursing professionalism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differentially regulated proteins in breast cancer chemotherapy : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry</field><field name="creator">Koehn, Henning</field><field name="description">Intrinsic or acquired drug resistance of tumours is a major problem for successful therapy of breast cancer patients. The efficacy of doxorubicin, one of the most important and commonly used drugs in chemotherapy, can be severely compromised by a variety of unspecific mechanisms rendering tumours drug resistant. Little is known however, about the specific events taking place in response to doxorubicin treatment, which may repair doxorubicin-induced damage, leading to drug resistance. Doxorubicin is a topoisomerase II poison, which interferes with topoisomerase II enzymes during DNA replication, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks. Topoisomerase II enzymes mediate the passage of DNA strands by introducing transient DNA breaks, and are essential for changes in DNA topology during replication. The DNA lesions induced by the combination of topoisomerase II and doxorubicin can be repaired by either non homologous end-joining or homologous recombination repair, as both pathways are specifically responsible for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit in non homologous end-joining and Rad51 in homologous recombination repair are essential for each of these pathways. If it was possible to specifically target these proteins or other antagonistic mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cell death, which may be activated in response to doxorubicin treatment, chemosensitivity of tumours could be restored and chemotherapy made more effective. Hence it was the purpose of this study to investigate proteome-wide changes in protein expression in response to drug treatment, as well as specifically analysing alterations in the protein levels of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit and Rad51. Global changes in protein regulation of breast and breast cancer cells were investigated using mass spectrometric and electrophoretic analysis techniques. These experiments however, could not reproducibly identify any genuine drug-induced changes in protein levels, as only proteins of relatively high abundance could be analysed. Immunoblotting results however, showed that Rad51 was differentially regulated in a cell line- and drug dosage-dependent manner, while levels of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, increased levels of topoisomerase II alpha protein were also detected. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that both Rad51 and the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit could be independently overexpressed in breast tumours and therefore may represent potential targets for selectively enhancing chemosensitivity of breast cancers.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug resistance</field><field name="subject">Protein expression</field><field name="subject">Doxorubicin</field><field name="subject">Topoisomerase II</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinetics of spear growth and asparagus productivity : control by environmental and internal factors : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ku, Yang Gyu</field><field name="description">Studies on asparagus growth in relation to yield were undertaken in environmentally controlled growth cabinets and in greenhouses. Bud production during the annual growth cycle was also investigated in the field. Growth cabinet experiments showed that increasing the temperature had a significant effect on bud break and relative spear growth rate (RSGR), but although prior chilling had a significant effect on the length of time to bud break at 10&#176;C and 15&#176;C, the effect on RSGR was not so clear. The cytokinin-active compound, N-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-N'-phenylurea (CPPU), and the naturally occurring cytokinin, zeatin riboside (ZR) significantly stimulated spear elongation. However, spear leaf scale removal reduced spear elongation in the absence and presence of CPPU. CPPU only stimulated spear growth when spear leaf scales were present, indicating that other plant hormones may interact with cytokinins in promoting elongation. The importance of spear growth rate to yield was discussed. In greenhouse experiments, CPPU applied as a foliar spray at 10 or 20 mg L-1 was effective in producing longer and thicker cladodes that might be associated with increased photosynthetic rate. However, photosynthetic rate was unaffected by 10 mg L-1 CPPU treatment. Repeated CPPU applications to foliage reduced net assimilation rate (NAR) compared to untreated controls as determined by growth analysis studies. In asparagus plants, it was difficult to collect xylem sap and further experiments were undertaken with Capsicum annuum. The root exudate of CPPU-treated plants significantly decreased hypocotyl length in the lettuce gibberellin bioassay, suggesting that CPPU blocks gibberellin biosynthesis in roots. However, the application of GA3 to shoots did not reverse growth suppression caused by CPPU-treated roots. Bud production, both in growth cabinets and in open field plantings, started to occur during the spear harvest period in contrast to previously accepted views. During harvest three to four additional buds per cluster were produced in cabinet-grown plants and an average of 51 buds per m2 in field plantings. These results confirm that new bud initiation and development starts to occur during spear harvest, as well as during fern growth and establishment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asparagus growth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300302 Plant growth and development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking increased returns to industry-level change : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Business and Administration in Strategy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Obren, Mark</field><field name="description">While the change literature is currently dominated by the punctuated equilibrium paradigm, anomalies have appeared to the paradigm in the form of high velocity change and hypercompetition. D'Aveni (1999) reconciles these anomalies with the punctuated equilibrium paradigm by suggesting that the frequency of change experienced affects the change experienced. This research considered whether the presence of increasing returns in an industry is correlated with the frequency of change experienced by the industry and the types of change that appear, thus providing an explanation for the differing forms of change. A second observation in the literature is that an industry experiences a period of instability after a discontinuity. This research considered whether the temporal proximity or type of a preceding discontinuity influenced the likelihood or type of later discontinuities. A longitudinal study identified discontinuities in nine industries throughout the industries' histories. The industries were categorised as: increasing returns, derived from external network effects (Airlines, Data Communications, Electricity and Shipping Lines), complementarity (Information Storage) or information content (Software), respectively; or as constant returns (Aircraft Manufacturing, Telecommunications Manufacturing and Shipbuilding). A comparison of discontinuities has been made between pairs of industries with a common end-user of the industry outputs, where one industry exhibits increasing returns and the companion industry has constant returns, using Binomial Distribution, Fisher's Exact Test and Generalised Linear Modelling techniques. Further Generalised Linear Models tested the interactions of discontinuities. Industries with increasing returns were found to have greater frequency of change. The types of change experienced were found to affect subsequent change, with both types of discontinuities being correlated with increased proportions of competency-enhancing change for ten years, while competency-destroying and competency-enhancing discontinuities were associated with increased frequency of change for twenty and ten years, respectively. The evidence associating increasing returns with competency type was unreliable. Consequently, increasing returns industries may experience a greater variation of frequency of change, with industries entering and leaving periods of enhanced frequencies of change. Thus, industries with increasing returns are more likely to experience change consistent with hypercompetition and high velocity conditions, compared with the punctuated equilibrium style change experienced by constant returns industries.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Discontinuities</field><field name="subject">Organisational change</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Type 2 diabetes : understanding the self-regulatory experience : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North</field><field name="creator">Paddison, Charlotte Anna Mary</field><field name="description">This research investigates type 2 diabetes using a psychological approach grounded in self-regulatory theory. Diabetes mellitus is usually described as a long-term illness with serious physical consequences, and biomedical perspectives predominate in published diabetes research. Findings from the present study add to accumulating knowledge about diabetes by addressing an identifiable gap in the literature, namely, an understanding of the psychological processes involved in managing type 2 diabetes. The common sense model (CSM) of illness self-regulation was used as the conceptual framework for this study. The research sample (N = 1145) was identified from a medical database. A mailed questionnaire survey was used to obtain psychological and self-report data, and this was subsequently merged with clinical data from a review of the medical database. A response rate of 55% provided a total of 629 completed questionnaires. The age, gender, and cultural composition of the sample were a close match with those reported for the New Zealand type 2 diabetes population. Research findings contribute to self-regulatory theory by testing key relationships specified in the CSM. The identification of a relationship cluster connecting emotional illness responses with cyclical symptoms, serious consequences, strong illness identity, and low coherence, highlights an emotional pathway in diabetes self-regulation. Observed relationships support the interaction between cognition and affect proposed in the CSM. Results show significant relationships between treatment perceptions and diabetes self-management, and draw attention to the importance of family relationships in explaining diet and exercise patterns. Perceived consequences of diabetes play a pertinent role in explaining variance in quality of life, and diabetes-related distress. The CSM postulates coping responses mediate between representations and illness outcomes; current findings, showing that medication use mediates the relationship between treatment representations and HbA1c, support the predicted mediating relationship. It is concluded the common sense model provides a useful theoretical framework for research investigating self-care and wellbeing among people with type 2 diabetes. Potential implications for psychological theory and clinical practice are discussed, and three areas - examining the roles of appraisal, emotion, and culture in illness management - are identified as priority targets for further research and conceptual development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes mellitus</field><field name="subject">Diabetes self-management</field><field name="subject">Coping with diabetes</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing and predicting selection response in Tribolium : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Sheep Husbandry Department, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Rumball, William</field><field name="description">No abstract.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Selective breeding</field><field name="subject">Tribolium castaneum</field><field name="subject">Red flour beetle</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheological characterisation of age thickening in milk concentrates : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Engineering at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Trinh, Binh</field><field name="description">Pages A58-A66 are missing from original but content appears complete.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Milk powder</field><field name="subject">Rheological measurement</field><field name="subject">Age thickening viscosity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290102 Food engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The congruency hypothesis : a closer look at its components : interpersonal and achievement-oriented personality and life events : a dissertation presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Watson, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">This research involved an examination of Beck's congruency hypothesis (1983). There were three studies, each examining an assumption that underpins the congruency hypothesis. There were two groups of participants: 61 remitted depressives and 61 university student controls, who were followed for a 1-year period. The first study stemmed from Blatt's theory that interpersonal and achievement-oriented personality styles are independent and enduring, arising from different early childhood experiences. It investigated individuals' perceptions of the parenting style they had experienced in the first 16 years of their life and how these related to their current personality style. Overall, an achievement-oriented personality style (self-criticism) was predicted by maternal protectiveness in the university student sample and by a lack of maternal warmth in the clinical sample. No relationship between perceptions of early parenting and an interpersonal personality (dependency) was found. The second study comprised two parts. The first examined the stability of personality over the 1-year examination period. This was seen as an important test. For personality to be a vulnerability factor or diathesis in terms of the congruency hypothesis, it must be stable over time. The second part of this study investigated whether any significant changes in personality over time were predicted by recent negative life events that had been experienced. The results showed that all of the personality constructs investigated (sociotropy, autonomy (solitude, independence), dependency, self-criticism) were stable over the 6-month period. However, during the 12-month period, there was a significant decrease in mean scores on sociotropy for the university students group and a significant decrease in mean scores on sociotropy and dependency for the remitted depressives group. For the remitted depressives group, change in dependency was predicted by stress resulting from negative life events as rated by an independent research team (objective stress) but not by participants' own ratings of the stressfulness of these events (subjective stress). In research testing the congruency hypothesis, life events are routinely classified as being either sociotropic or autonomous. The third study investigated the validity of this practice. The results of this study demonstrated only partial support for the a priori procedure for classifying events in this way. Across samples (university students and remitted depressives) and measures (self-reported and interview measures of life events), participants did not consistently rate events as sociotropic or autonomous in line with their own personality styles. Throughout the research, many of the methodological shortfalls that were identified as being present in prior research on the congruency hypothesis were addressed. Notably, comparisons were made between the different samples (student versus clinical) and measures (self-report versus interview) used. The results of the current research differed depending on the choice of sample and the type of measures used. For example, in some instances, significant results were found only when the stressfulness of an event was rated by the research team (objective stress) rather than by the participants themselves (subjective stress). However, it is subjective stress that is most commonly used in previous research on the congruency hypothesis. This choice could well contribute to the many non-significant results found in this area of study. These and other methodological issues are taken into account, examined, discussed, and recommendations for future research are made.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Life events</field><field name="subject">Personality styles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depictions of Thailand in Australian and Thai writings:Reflections of the Self and Other</field><field name="creator">Pissa-ard, Isaraporn</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Modern Australian literature</field><field name="subject">Modern Thai literature</field><field name="subject">Literature and society</field><field name="subject">Australian and Thai literature</field><field name="subject">Australian and Thai society</field><field name="subject">Thai literature</field><field name="subject">Australian and Thai literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social capital and social entrepreneurship : Analysing links and implications for sustainability in third sector organisations in West Bengal</field><field name="creator">Basu, Saswati</field><field name="description">The theory of social capital attracts considerable attention across diversified fields due to its positive impact on society. A major portion of social capital literature is devoted to defining the concept and identifying the sources and factors that contribute to social capital development. Putnam (1993), the major proponent of this theory, defined social capital as the trust, norms and networks that facilitate coordinated action and improve the efficiency of society. He considered voluntary organisations to be a significant source of social capital as they encourage the trust-based relationships required for collective action. Many authors argued that social capital development is context specific. Krishna (2002) found that in a poor socio-economic context, social entrepreneurs acting as mediators can activate social capital and bring development. Social entrepreneurs act as catalysts to social change (Alvord et al. 2004), but limited studies have focused on their role in voluntary organisations in developing social capital. The present research analyses the activities of social entrepreneurs who assist in building and strengthening social capital among villagers as a part of the development process, and the implications of these activities for organisational sustainability. The activities of two types of social entrepreneurs, outsiders (SEETOs) and insiders (non- SEETOs) have been analysed. The research used a qualitative design and case study approach to investigate multiple levels of analysis within the single study. The case study organisations are five rural voluntary organisations from the state of West Bengal, India &#8212; three with SEETOs and two with non-SEETOs. Primary data have been collected during 2007 and 2008 through face-to-face interviews, published materials, photographs and participant observations. The findings of this research indicate that the development of social capital is dependent on the &#8216;enabling&#8217; leadership style of social entrepreneurs. The &#8216;enabling&#8217; leaders played an important role in transforming an organisation into a learning organisation and developed the villagers&#8217; organisational ability or social agency (an element of social capital) as a group to solve their own problems. The learning organisation ensures organisational sustainability. The study also observed the &#8216;benevolent dictator&#8217; leadership style. The &#8216;benevolent dictator&#8217; failed to create a learning organisation, and so the villagers had no organizational ability or social agency, which then placed organisational sustainability at risk. However, both types of leader played positive and effective roles in improving the lives of poor villagers. The research confirmed the social entrepreneur&#8217;s role in social capital development in voluntary organisations within a poor socio-economic context.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural care in nursing : a critical analysis</field><field name="creator">Seaton, Lesley, P</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of human globalisation has led to the creation of a new social world, one which is characterised by its cultural diversity. Health services constitute one of the most fundamental of social organisations, so with this change, has come a need for nurses to provide relevant and appropriate care to the multiplicity of peoples who now live in contemporary social communities. Providing appropriate nursing care today is demanding new skills of nurses and to ensure that they can meet this demand, new knowledge and understanding is required. To do this well, constitutes one of the greatest contemporary challenges facing nursing. The aim of this study was to identify and analyse the theories and models of nursing that hold authority on and guide cross-cultural care giving in nursing. The thesis underlying this study was to respond to the question - when nurses have had access to cultural care theory and its related literature for some 30 years, why has this not, as yet, had a significant impact on nursing? The intent being to explore the genesis and development of the knowledge used to underpin cross-cultural care in nursing and by doing so assist nurses to better understand, in the fullest sense, the meanings that are being created and conveyed. To achieve this, a qualitative methodology was employed to make possible the description and interpretation of existing theory with a critical approach being taken towards that text. Understanding and unmasking the theory revealed both overt and covert beliefs and ideas intrinsic to the discourse, which have the potential to shape and configure nurses&#8217; attitudes, opinions and perspectives. This research has considered, explored and analysed contemporary theories of cross-cultural nursing to provide clarification and enhance the capacity of nurses to gain a fuller understanding of cross-cultural care. It offers new insights into the viewpoints being advanced and opens up fresh possibilities for the development of a deeper understanding of Western scholarship on culture in nursing. The findings also identify areas for continued inquiry, which if focused upon and developed into the future, could contribute to improvements in nursing and greater understanding of the complex domain of cross-cultural care.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transcultural nursing.</field><field name="subject">Cultural awareness.</field><field name="subject">Nurse and patient.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1130</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A criminalistic approach to biological evidence : trace DNA and volume crime offences</field><field name="creator">Raymond, Jennifer Joan</field><field name="description">Volume crimes such as burglary and street robbery present an enormous cost to the Australian community each year. These ubiquitous crimes traditionally have a low resolution rate, but the use of information gathered through DNA databases provides another avenue of investigation. The forensic response to these crimes could be increased with the use of trace DNA; however the lack of awareness of forensic science as a holistic discipline focusing on the study of traces, often leads to a lack of knowledge into the trace evidence characteristics of DNA. This problem is compounded by practical and interpretive difficulties. The main hypothesis tested through this study is that, with an increased understanding into the criminalistic properties of trace DNA, it may prove to be more useful and effective evidence in the investigation of volume crime than is currently the case. The project encompassed three parts. The first component was a detailed survey sent to every jurisdiction in Australia and New Zealand to benchmark methods and protocols, education and training of personnel, and opinions and uses of trace DNA. The second involved the analysis of the results of 250 trace DNA swabs collected from New South Wales crime scenes, in order to provide a comparison point to the experimental work. The final section comprised preliminary experimental work to investigate the abundance, transfer and persistence of trace DNA within the context of residential burglary and street robbery offences. The methods survey helped to identify methods to be used in the experimental component of the project, but also highlighted issues in the field including a lack of training and proficiency testing. The absence of data collation across the jurisdictions was also a point for concern, and prevented the identification of factors that may affect trace DNA success rates. The pervading outcome of the survey was the need for effective data management systems and strong communication lines to facilitate best practice. From the analysis of the casework data a success rate in the order of 15- 20% was identified for New South Wales trace DNA swabs, with an average of 1.7ng of DNA recovered. Subsets of the data were used to directly compare to the experimental results in terms of transfer and persistence.  The experimental work gave an insight into the behaviour of trace DNA in crime scene scenarios. The level of background DNA on surfaces encountered in forensic investigations was varied; for example residential doors were found to hold more background DNA than windows. Whilst the level of DNA on personal items such as bags and wallets was found to be relatively high, DNA from the offenders of simulated robberies could still be detected in usable quantities on these items. DNA was found to persist in sheltered locations for at least six weeks,but declined more rapidly in outdoor environments, with profiles not recovered after two weeks. This information may help to assist the interpretation and presentation of trace DNA evidence when the judicial question is one of activity, rather than source. The data also may be used in the education of crime scene examiners to assist them to target the most probative evidential samples. With further work in this field, trace DNA will be more easily applied to investigations. Trace DNA may be a useful tool in volume crime investigations, but individual jurisdictions should assess their capacity to manage the evidence to ensure results can be disseminated and actioned in a timely manner, otherwise the  investment  may prove to be fruitless. Effective and ongoing training programs and functional data management systems should be implemented to maximise both the investigative and intelligence value of trace DNA evidence. A holistic approach to the implementation of forensic evidence, encompassing the groundwork of theoretical analysis, review of capabilities and logistical and technical improvements, would greatly increase its value in policing and the criminal justice system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA data banks.</field><field name="subject">Forensic sciences.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bi-level decision making with fuzzy sets and particle swarm optimisation</field><field name="creator">Gao, Ya</field><field name="description">Bi-level programming techniques are developed for decentralized decision problems with decision makers located in a two-level decision making system; the upper decision maker is termed the leader while the lower is the follower. Both the leader and the follower try to optimise their own objective functions and the corresponding decisions do not control but do affect those of the other level. This research aims at solving bi-level decision problems with five extensions, i.e. multiple leaders/followers/objectives, fuzzy coefficients and goals. By using particle swarm optimisation and/or cut set and/or goal programming and/or Nash equilibrium concept, related mathematical models and corresponding algorithms are developed to solve fuzzy linear bi-level decision problems, fuzzy linear multi-objective bi-level decision problems, fuzzy linear multi-follower multi-objective bi-level decision problems, fuzzy linear goal bi-level decision problems, multi-leader one-follower bi-level decision problems, one-leader multi-follower bi-level decision problems, and multileader multi-follower bi-level decision problems. A fuzzy bi-level decision support system is then developed which implements all the algorithms to support bi-level decision making with different features. Finally, by using these bi-level models and algorithms, we explore possible applications in the fields of railway train set organisation, railway wagon flow management, strategic bidding in the electricity market, and supply chains to solve real world bi-level decision problems.

The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay: links to anthropogenic nutrients</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Ahern</field><field name="description">The increased proliferation of benthic marine cyanobacteria of the Lyngbya genus in many tropical and subtropical systems worldwide is a concern due to the detrimental impacts these blooms can have on ecosystems, local economies and public health. While increasing nutrient loads from anthropogenic sources/activities has been hypothesised as the main cause, evidence to support this is limited. This hypothesis was explored by investigating blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in a sub-tropical shallow coastal embayment (Moreton Bay) in southeast Queensland, Australia&#8212;where blooms have increased in frequency and severity. More specifically, the thesis aimed to investigate the role of nutrients in the physiology and growth dynamics of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay through examination of three main research questions. Examination of the spatial and temporal variations in the growth and nutritional status of L. majuscula in Moreton Bay (Research Question 1) was investigated by tracking natural summer blooms in northeastern Moreton Bay (Deception Bay) over two successive years. Detailed field observations, extensive biomass and tissue nutrient sampling (every 10&#8211;14 days) and a three-dimensional model were used to map the change in areal extent, biomass and tissue nutrients over the course of the blooms. The results demonstrated the innate ability of L. majuscula to rapidly spread and generate massive amounts of biomass, with the peak biomass calculated at 5057 tww in the 2005&#8211;2006 and 10 213 tww in the 2006&#8211;2007 seasons. A sequence of phases showing differing appearance, biomass growth and tissue nutrient changes were identified and documented. The role of nutrients (individually and collectively) in the enhancement of L. majuscula growth (Research Question 2) was investigated using a combination of comprehensive laboratory experiments (filament growth, 14C-bicarbonate uptake rate and biomass increase) and in-situ field experiments. Addition of nutrients to the water column were shown to promote prolific L. majuscula growth in the laboratory; this was confirmed in field experiments at two locations in Moreton Bay&#8212;showing nutrients can be a major causal factor in bloom formation. Additions of phosphorus (macronutrient) and iron (required for photosynthesis and nitrogen-fixation) caused the greatest stimulation of L. majuscula in both laboratory and field experiments. The form of iron was shown to be important &#8212;organically complexed iron (FeEDTA) was substantially more effective in promoting L. majuscula growth under laboratory conditions than inorganic iron (FeCl3). This is important as FeEDTA mirrors the naturally occurring iron organic complexes (which increase the solubility of iron) in waters from the region. The effect of nitrogen additions was more complex&#8212;likely due to the capacity of L. majuscula to fix atmospheric nitrogen reducing reliance on an inorganic nitrogen source. In the high light conditions experienced in this study, L. majuscula appeared to acquire nitrogen: (i) directly from the dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column&#8212;evidenced by a positive response to the nitrogen treatments; and, (ii) through enhanced nitrogen-fixation rates when iron and/or phosphorus were added in the absence of nitrogen&#8212;inferred from a substantial increase in the total nitrogen content of the L. majuscula biomass (nitrogen-fixation was not measured directly). The main sources of naturally occurring nutrients likely to promote L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay (Research Question 3) were investigated using laboratory experiments, soil and water analyses, and GIS-based modelling. The potential for groundwater/surfacewater from different vegetation, soils, geology and landuses within the study area catchments to stimulate L. majuscula response (14C-bicarbonate uptake rate) was tested in laboratory bioassays. Areas with acid sulfate soils (ASS), Melaleuca vegetation, pine plantations and Casuarina on ASS all had waters that enhanced L. majuscula growth. To investigate causal agents, bioassay response data and water analyses were subject to multiple regression and correlation analysis; this confirmed the importance of iron, phosphorus and nitrogen to L. majuscula growth and the roles of low pH and dissolved organic carbon, the latter two appearing to influence the chemical state and enhance the solubility of nutrients to L. majuscula. This information was incorporated into a GIS-based model to identify areas of hazard which were most likely to supply/export nutrients to Moreton Bay. These hazard maps, with further local verification, will be used as planning and decision support tools to assist government and landuse managers to limit the mobilisation and transport of key nutrients to potential bloom sites. The results from this thesis demonstrate that a precautionary approach to limit phosphorus, iron, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon to waterways is necessary; otherwise the magnitude of L. majuscula blooms is likely to increase in Moreton Bay as coastal development intensifies with the predicted population increase. The thesis findings provide strong support for the hypothesised link between nutrients and the increased proliferation of Lyngbya and other benthic cyanobacteria blooms and are likely to be applicable to other areas where environmental conditions are suitable for their growth.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blooms</field><field name="subject">cyanobacterium</field><field name="subject">groundwater</field><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">nutrients</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

There is also a lack of focus in the organisational development literature on the phenomena of continuous change. The literature remains dominated by examinations of radical, second order or discontinuous change, which often provides useful information on how firms deal with crises, but provides little by way of advice on how to avoid such crises in the first place.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wine industry</field><field name="subject">Organisational Planning and Management</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">organisational development</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/28286</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:28286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power reduction of mine ventilation fans /</field><field name="creator">Beswick, Michael</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEng)--University of South Australia, 1998</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fans (Machinery)</field><field name="subject">Mine ventilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/85270</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlates of auditory hallucinations in non-psychotic children /</field><field name="creator">Best, Nicole</field><field name="description">The phenomenon of auditory hallucinations in clinical populations of non-psychotic children is an intriguing and little understood area. To date, investigations in this area have reported on a range of correlates, including family histories of psychiatric illness, family dysfunction, and significant levels of stress in the children themselves. The current study reported on 10 non-psychotic children drawn from a number of community based child and family agencies that provide therapeutic out-patient services. Consistent with previous studies this study found strong associations with family dysfunction, specifically family break-up, as well as significant levels of anxiety and depression in the these children. In addition, half the children reported the presence of imaginary companions. Despite some confirmation of previous findings, many other features of this phenomenon remain unanswered including the different psychological functions that hallucinations and imaginary companions serve for emotionally troubled children. Two case studies describe the family histories and hallucinations in more detail.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/79723</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:44133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of railway network control logic using coloured petri nets</field><field name="creator">Janczura, Chris</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 1998</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petri nets</field><field name="subject">Railroads</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/84060</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational investigations into the structure and reactivity of small transition metal clusters.</field><field name="creator">Addicoat, Matthew</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a number of largely independent forays into developing an understanding of the unique chemistry of transition metal clusters. The first chapter of this thesis represents an initial foray into mapping the chemical reactivity of transition metal clusters - a monumental task that will doubtless continue for some time. The small slice undertaken in this work investigates the reactivity with CO of a series of the smallest possible metal clusters; 4d (Nb - Ag) homonuclear metal trimers. In Chapter 2, two known transition metal clusters were studied using CASSCF (MCSCF) and MRCI methods, only to find that DFT methods provided more accurate Ionisation Potentials (IPs). Thus Chapter 3 was devoted to optimising a density functional to predict IPs. As clusters get larger, the number of possible structures grows rapidly too large for human intuition to handle, thus Chapter 4 is devoted to the use of an automated stochastic algorithm, &#8220;Kick&#8221;, for structure elucidation. Chapter 5 improves on this algorithm, by permitting chemically sensible molecular fragments to be defined and used. Chapter 6 then comes full circle and uses the new Kick algorithm to investigate the reaction of CO with a series of mono-substituted niobium tetramers (i.e. Nb&#8323;X).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transition metal clusters; density functional theory; stochastic search algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic performance of reinforced concrete frames.</field><field name="creator">Kashyap, Jaya</field><field name="description">Many intra-tectonic plate regions are considered to have low to moderate seismic risk. However, devastating earthquakes can occur in these regions and result in high consequences in terms of casualties and damage. Non-ductile detailing practice employed in these structures make them prone to potential damage and failure during an earthquake. Furthermore, the use of infill walls is a divisive issue as on positive side dual wall-frame systems have beneficial effects related to strength, stiffness, and ductility. However, if not designed properly infill wall can also lead to undesirable structural failures of complete wall frame system. Although, there has been significant amount of international research in this area, it is worth noting that very little research exists for Australian frames. This thesis presents the experimental and analytical research conducted at The University of Adelaide to gain some insight into the behaviour of typically detailed Australian reinforced concrete frames subjected to ground motions. The main objectives of this research were (1) to investigate the behaviour of non-seismically designed reinforced concrete frames under a 500-YRP earthquake; (2) to determine the different magnitudes of earthquake (YRP) that are likely to cause excessive drifts in or collapse of gravity-load-designed reinforced concrete frames and (3) to investigate the effect of infill walls on the moment-resisting frames subjected to seismic loads. The experimental program consisted of earthquake simulation tests on a 1/5 scale model of a 3-storey reinforced concrete frame and four &#189;-scale reinforced concrete brick infilled frame specimens subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. The analytical study included static pushover and non-linear dynamic analyses of the 3-, 5- and 12-storey reinforced concrete frames. From the overall performance of gravity-load-designed bare reinforced concrete frames considered in this study, it was concluded that the non-seismically designed frames appear to be capable of resisting a &#8220;design magnitude earthquake&#8221; (i.e., 500- YRP) in low earthquake hazard regions. However, their behaviour under more severe earthquakes (e.g. a 2500-YRP earthquake) is questionable. Perhaps the earthquake design requirements should consider as an alternative the &#8216;collapse prevention&#8217; limit state for longer return period earthquakes, of the order of 2000&#8211;2500-YRP. The experimental research on reinforced concrete infilled frame indicated that the infill wall does not adversely effect the in plane ultimate strength, stiffness, and ductility of the bare reinforced concrete frame.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Concrete frame; Drift; Ductility; Earthquake; Static pushover analysis; Dynamic analysis; Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indoor wireless communication system performance enhancement via environmental modification</field><field name="creator">Lee, Derek C. K.</field><field name="description">High capacity wireless communication systems require efficient reuse of the available frequency spectrum. Frequency reuse in buildings can be enhanced by modifying the environment. However, the potential benefits of environmental modification need to be evaluated systematically to justify the related costs. This thesis reports the methods, the deployment strategies and the resulting system performance improvement of in-building environmental modification. In the investigation, coordinated deployment of a wireless communication system with multiple base stations is considered in several single-floor office environments. The base stations, each servicing a cell, are assumed to operate at the same set of frequencies thus adjacent interference results. Two modification methods, namely, metal reflectors and metal shields, are considered to enhance desired signals and mitigate adjacent interference, respectively. Significant impact of both methods on the propagation channel is experimentally observed. The potential benefits of deploying structural shielding to control interference are considered. The levels of adjacent interference are estimated for different shielding strategies by an experimentally-validated ray-model, and the outage probabilities are computed with an interference-limited DS-CDMA system model. Deployment of structural shielding is shown to be most effective in drywall-partitioned environments and when the operating frequency is in the vicinity of 5 GHz. The average outage probability is shown to be reduced by approximately 94% and 90% at 1.8 GHz and 5.24 GHz, respectively, for a drywall-partitioned office environment after shielding 14% of the internal wall length. In open plan offices, the effectiveness of structural shielding is observed to diminish as the partition height reduces. Alternatively, considerable interference control is shown to be achieved by highly-reflective reflectors installed on the ceiling above the base stations. In the presence of a significant centrally-located environmental obstacle, the cost effectiveness of structural shielding deployment is shown to increase as the obstacle acts as an effective interference attenuator. If frequency selective surfaces (FSSs) are used instead of metal shields, a good shielding performance is shown to be achievable as long as the FSS stopband attenuation is maintained at above 20 dB for incident angles smaller than 50 degrees.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Comparative Form, Function and Ecology of some New Zealand Brittle-Stars (Ophiuroidea)</field><field name="creator">Pentreath, Richard John</field><field name="description">In her classic review of the echinoderms, Hyman (1955), describes the ophiuroids as "the most successful echinoderm group living today".

Analyses are carried out to predict the surface response that results from earthquake motions being transmitted through the upper layers of the earth. The nature of the near surface geological layers affect to a marked degree the intensity of surface motion. The mathematical models presented are used in the evaluation of site response to earthquakes. The theoretical methods used depart from the traditional viscoelastic approach and use a nonlinear hysteretic soil model to describe the complex dynamic stress-strain relationships evident in soil response. The dynamic soil model is based on previous laboratory work carried out at this university. The theoretical solutions formulated are limited to one-dimensional situations. Three methods of analysis are presented for the propagation of seismic shear waves through nonlinear soil media and conclusions are drawn as to the best approach. The results of these analyses are generally significantly different from those obtained using a viscoelastic soil model. Seismic dilatational waves are also considered important and a method is presented to calculate the response of hysteretic soil media to these disturbances. The outcome from these dilatational and shear wave analyses is more accurate surface response spectra for use in aseismic structural design.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple perspectives on the education of mathematically gifted and talented students : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bicknell, Brenda Anne</field><field name="description">This study examines multiple perspectives on the education of a group of fifteen Year 6 and Year 8 students identified as mathematically gifted and talented. The students&#8217; mathematical experiences, both past and present are examined using evidence from school policy documents; student, teacher, and parent interviews; questionnaires; and classroom observations. The purpose of this case study was to seek understandings about awareness of the characteristics of mathematically gifted and talented students, the identification of and educational provisions for mathematically gifted and talented students, parental involvement, and school transfer. The group of fifteen students consisted of ten Year 6 students who transferred from primary school to a new school for Year 7, and five Year 8 students who moved to secondary schools for Year 9. These students had been identified by their school and teachers as gifted and talented in mathematics. This predominantly qualitative study is underpinned by an interpretive paradigm and influenced by a sociocultural philosophy of learning and teaching. The literature review presents the dilemmas, similarities, and differences that prevail in the field of gifted education. A more specific focus is given to the education of mathematically gifted students to highlight gaps in the field. This two-year study tracking a group of students provides a cohesive approach to understanding the educational provisions for students identified as mathematically gifted and talented in the New Zealand setting. The multiple case studies included interviews, questionnaires, documents, and observations. The research findings show that there is not a comprehensive understanding by schools and teachers about the characteristics of mathematically gifted students. Despite the documentation of a range of identification processes in school policies, a multiple method approach is not practised in many schools. Provision of appropriate programmes is variable and determined by factors such as school organization, identification, teacher knowledge and expertise, and resources. Parents play a key role in their children&#8217;s mathematics education as motivators, resource providers, monitors, mathematics content advisers, and mathematical learning advisers. Schools, teachers, parents, and peers all contribute to the success of a student&#8217;s transfer from one phase of schooling to another; they support a student&#8217;s social and emotional well being and influence curriculum continuity in mathematics. This study provides insights into the various determinants of the development of mathematical talent. For New Zealand schools and teachers, it provides evidence that understanding the characteristics of mathematical giftedness is important and that identification processes must reflect this understanding. Provisions must be well considered and evaluated; the role of parents should be understood and valued; and home-school communications strengthened. Together, all stakeholders share a critical role in the education of mathematically gifted and talented students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">mathematics study and teaching</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330108 Special education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The usage of traditional Maori narratives as cognitive models and educational tools : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Social Anthropology at Massey University, Albany Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Benavides, Sebastian Pelayo</field><field name="description">The present research consists of an interdisciplinary approach which combines mainly sub-disciplines from the anthropological and psychological perspectives as theoretical background. Regarding the latter, from the cognitive anthropology perspective the research highlights Bradd Shore&#8217;s (1996) view on cognitive models, together with the theories put forward by the sociocultural approach in psychology based on Vygotsky&#8217;s school of thought. The main objective of the study is to achieve a broad view on the use of traditional korero paki and korero o nehera (Maori folktales/legends and myths) as pedagogical tools and as cognitive models. The latter includes a bibliographical review which covers the analysis of narratives and their usage from different areas, such as Maori epistemology and education, cultural psychology and cognitive anthropology.

Therefore, the research analyses &#8211;based on semi-structured interviews- the perspectives and understanding of the usage of traditional Maori narratives as educational tools of scholars in the Maori studies/education field and of a sample of Maori teachers, most of them connected to a Kura Kaupapa Maori school, constituting a &#8220;study case&#8221; for this qualitative study.

The objective of this work was to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of dairy fouling in heat exchangers and identify methods to control this build-up. This was part of a larger project investigating the interaction between spore-forming thermophilic bacilli (thermophiles) contamination and fouling deposits on internal surfaces of equipment. Two systems were developed to monitor the onset and build-up of fouling on the internal surfaces of two research heat exchangers. The first used a commercial sensor to measure the local heat flux and the temperature on the hot side of a plate type heat exchanger. The heat transfer coefficient was calculated and normalised with its value at the start of the run to reflect the contribution of fouling deposits to the thermal resistance, thus giving a real-time estimate of the rate of fouling. The second system used an energy balance over a tubular type heat exchanger and measured inlet and outlet temperatures to estimate the overall heat transfer coefficient thus giving a global measurement of fouling over the tubular heat exchanger. In both systems the plot of normalised heat transfer coefficient over time often stayed constant over an induction period, which was followed by a falling period indicative of growth in the fouling layer thickness and/or mass. Each system was validated by comparing the final value of the normalised heat transfer coefficient with direct measurements of fouling made at the end of a run namely: fouling deposit height for the local measurement and fouling deposit mass for the global measurement. The normalised heat transfer coefficient reported by each system correlated well with the corresponding direct measurement of the fouling layer. An important factor identified in this study was the effect of air bubble nucleation on fouling deposits. It was shown that bubbles that formed on the heated surface greatly reduced the length of the induction period to a matter of seconds rather than hours, as found in previous studies of fouling in the absence of surface bubbles. The rate of fouling was also enhanced while the bubbles remained at the surface. The structure of bubble type fouling layers was linked to the behaviour of the bubbles at the heated surface. Visual observations of these bubbles showed evidence of growth, vibration and coalescence during their period of attachment to the heated surface. Deposits from bubble type fouling consisted of all solid components found in the original milk solution, except lactose, in approximately the same ratio. By contrast fouling deposits reported in the literature with systems operating under the traditional protein denaturation mechanism were reported to consist mainly of whey proteins. Bubble induced fouling can be limited in a number of ways, the most effective being to maintain a high operating pressure in the equipment to ensure nucleation does not occur. Experiments conducted in this study showed that a pressure of 130 kPa.g was sufficient to suppress all bubble nucleation at the heated surface at a temperature of 90&#176;C. Another method identified was the use of high linear fluid velocities to entrain any surface bubbles into the processing stream immediately upon nucleation. Linear velocities above 1.0 m/s were shown to achieve this goal in the miniature plate heat exchanger tested. However, this method is only partially successful because the local linear velocity varies with position in heat exchange equipment of complex geometries and can drop below the mainstream average velocity causing surface bubbles to form, especially in recirculation regions behind flow obstacles. A more reliable method, in situations where high operating pressures could not be used, involved conditioning the heated surface with a thin protein layer during the first few minutes of a run. Conditioning the surface resulted in bubble suppression even at high temperatures and low pressures, thus greatly extending the length of the induction period. Trials performed in this study showed that the addition of a proteolytic enzyme produced by psychrotrophic microbes greatly increased fouling. The enzyme destabilised the caseins which could attach directly to the heat exchange surface independently from the bubble fouling mechanism. Thus the quality of the milk is another important factor to consider. However, the addition of enzymes produced by thermophilic bacilli isolated from milk powder plants did not increase fouling. A theory describing the air bubble induced fouling mechanism is presented along with recommendations on how to reduce this fouling contamination in processing equipment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy processing equipment</field><field name="subject">heat exchanger</field><field name="subject">fouling deposits</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of two ultrafiltration membrane systems for whole milk feta cheese production : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chollangi, Anusha</field><field name="description">Cheese is one of the most well known food products in the world dating back to the 8th century B.C. There are more than 2000 varieties of cheese that are manufactured all over the world. Feta cheese is a soft white cheese with a salty and slightly acidic taste, which has originated from Greece. Most of the feta cheese manufactured in Greece is consumed locally, the migration of greeks to other parts of the world led to a demand for feta cheese outside of Greece. The spreading of the popularity of feta cheese to other ethnic groups in different parts of the world resulted in the high demand for feta cheese worldwide. The modern and most efficient method of feta cheese production involves a membrane filtration method, known as ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration process utilises pressure as a driving force to concentrate milk by removal of water and small dissolved molecules. Hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration membranes are the two types of membranes that are commonly used for cheese production. An extensive amount of research exists on the implementation of ultrafiltration to improve the efficiency of the cheese making process and the performance of the membranes. However, limited research has been conducted on the comparison of the hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane performance in the cheese making process. The objective of the research was to determine if the hollow fibre membranes used at Puhoi Valley Cheese can be replaced with spiral wound membranes without compromising the quality of cheese produced. In order to achieve the objective, feta cheese was produced using hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration pilot plants. The operating performances of the hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane units were compared. To ensure that the quality of cheese is maintained, the cheese manufactured on the pilot plant units was analysed in terms of composition, microbiology, texture and sensory properties. The cheese made using the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant was compared with the reference sample from Puhoi Valley Cheese as they use hollow fibre membranes to produce feta cheese. The cheese made from the spiral wound membrane unit was also compared to that made by the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant unit. The operating parameters such as the inlet and outlet pressure, pressure difference along the membrane, transmembrane pressure, flow rate, recycle rate (bleed off rate), temperature and the run time were recorded. The operating parameters of the hollow fibre and spiral wound runs were compared with the data from Puhoi Valley Cheese. The quality of cheese made on the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant units were evaluated in terms of composition, texture, microbiology and sensory properties. The composition was defined by the fat, protein, total solids and salt contents. The fat content was determined by utilising the modified Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff method, protein by the Kjeldahl method, total solids by using the air drying oven and salt percentage by the volhard method. The texture of the cheese was determined by the fracturability and hardness from the compression curve generated using the single bite compression test. The microbiological testing was performed according to New Zealand testing methods for E.Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and yeast and mould. The difference from the control method was utilised for sensory evaluation. The acid degree value method was used to determine the lipase activity in feta cheese. It was found from the composition, texture and sensory analysis that the cheese from the hollow fibre pilot plant was different from the cheese manufactured at Puhoi Valley Cheeses (PVC). The spiral wound cheeses were also found to be different to PVC cheese, however the spiral wound cheeses and the pilot plant hollow fibre cheese were the same. The differences between both the pilot plant cheeses and PVC cheese were in terms of the fat, salt, moisture contents and the lipase activity in the cheeses. The fat content in the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses are lower in comparison to the PVC cheese. This difference in fat content is considered to be due to the difference in the fat to protein ratio of the milk concentrated on the pilot plant and the PVC ultrafiltration system. The lower fat content resulted in firmer cheese than PVC due to more cross linking between the protein strands in cheese. The salt content in the cheeses made using the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plants was lower than Puhoi Valley Cheese. This is considered to be due to the low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume used for salting the cheese. The salt content of brine decreases during brining; hence a low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume causes a significant decrease in brine concentration. The decrease in brine concentration decreases the salt intake of the cheese. As salt diffuses in the moisture diffuses out, lower salt content results in higher moisture content in the cheese. As mentioned, the moisture content of the hollow fibre pilot plant cheese was higher than the PVC cheese. The moisture content is inversely proportional to the total solids, hence higher moisture in pilot plant cheeses implies lower total solids than the PVC cheese. The lipase activity results showed that the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses had higher lipase activity than the Puhoi valley cheese. The differences in lipase activity of the pilot plant cheeses and Puhoi Valley cheese were considered to be due to the incomplete inactivation of lipase present in milk during pasteurisation. The results from texture and sensory evaluation support the above mentioned differences. The microbiology results for all pilot plant cheeses were within the trigger limits set by Puhoi valley cheeses. The results from monitoring the operating parameters of both the pilot plant data show that the permeate flux decreases while the total solids in milk increase with time, which was also observed from the Puhoi Valley Cheese data. However, the rate of decrease of the permeate flux and the increase of the total solids in milk are dependent on the membrane area, feed volume, transmembrane pressure, pressure drop across the membrane and the flow characteristics. The rate of decrease in permeate flux and the rate of increase in the total solids of the hollow fibre runs and spiral wound runs are slightly different. The difference is due to the availability of larger membrane surface area and processing of larger feed volume of milk in the spiral wound runs. The transmembrane pressure and the pressure drop across the membrane were maintained as close as possible to Puhoi Valley Cheese. In conclusion, spiral wound membranes can be used to achieve the desired total solids concentration and successfully make the same feta cheese as the hollow fibre pilot plant. In order to make the same quality of feta cheese as Puhoi Valley Cheese using the spiral wound membrane pilot plant, the same composition of milk used for concentration at Puhoi Valley Cheese needs to be used on the spiral wound pilot plant unit. It is recommended that Puhoi Valley Cheeses should be replaced with spiral wound membranes if they are more economical in terms of cost than the hollow fibre membranes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrafiltration process</field><field name="subject">cheese production</field><field name="subject">Puhoi Valley Cheese</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of ethylene and auxin in responses of roots to phosphate supply in white clover (Trifolium repens L.) : a thesis presentation in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dinh, Phuong Thi Yen</field><field name="description">Phosphate (P) supply is one of the major determining factors to plant productivity, since the element affects the growth and the development of plants. In response to Pdeficiency treatment, plants display alterations in root system architecture caused by changes in primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) length and LR density. In this thesis, the root growth of the agronomically important legume, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was found to be slightly stimulated in terms of PR length, LR number and total LR length when plants were grown in a P-deficient media (0.01 mM orthophosphate; Pi) when compared with plants grown in a P-sufficient media (1.00 mM Pi) when using a hydroponic growth system. When plants are grown in a P-sufficient media, treatment with 100 nM exogenous 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and exogenous auxin (5 nM 1- naphthylacetic acid, NAA) resulted in significant increases in white clover PR length, LR number and LR length. However, when ethylene action or auxin transport were inhibited using 300 ppm 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and 100 nM 1-Nnaphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), respectively, root growth was significantly reduced which suggests roles for ethylene and auxin in mediating white clover root growth. To examine the effects of these hormones on plants grown in P-deficient media, 100 nM ACC treatment significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of growth on Pdeficient media only, while exposure of plants to P-deficiency alone was sufficient to significantly neutralise the inhibitory effects of 1-MCP on root growth. Hence, exposure to P-deficiency is proposed to increase either ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene sensitivity in white clover roots. In contrast, for plants grown in P-deficient media, treatment with 5 nM NAA significantly abolished the stimulation of white clover root growth observed with P-deficiency so it is proposed that exposure to Pdeficiency increases either auxin biosynthesis or auxin sensitivity, but the 5nM NAA concentration used was too high to stimulate root growth. Using DR5p::GUS transgenic white clover, auxin activity was found in the root tips and root primordia. Using these plants, it is suggested that P-deficient treatment and ACC treatment influenced white clover root growth through an increase in auxin sensitivity. Overall, ethylene and auxin are found to be essential in mediating white clover root growth in P-sufficiency, and also in mediating root responses to P-deficiency through changes in terms of the biosynthesis and the sensitivity of these two hormones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens L</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">auxin</field><field name="subject">phosphate</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the construction of social work supervision in Aotearoa New Zealand : a study of the perspectives of social work practitioners and supervisors : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">O'Donoghue, Kieran Barry</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the construction of social work supervision from the perspectives of social work practitioners and supervisors. In particular, the research explored how social work supervision was constructed, the influence of the Aotearoa New Zealand context upon its construction, and where and how social work supervision can most effectively be improved. In order to provide a background for informed analysis and discussion of the research findings, key themes within the international and Aoteaoroa New Zealand supervision literature were discussed. The thesis was a mixed methods study that was informed by a constructionist conceptual framework with regard to the framing and exploration of the research questions. The methodological approach used was derived from pragmatism and involved a combination of survey research with qualitative individual interviews, with the survey being used to recruit and purposefully select participants for the individual interviews. The key findings from the study were: a) social work supervision was predominantly constructed from a professional standpoint, with the social, organisational and interpersonal context influencing how supervision was produced in any setting at anytime; b) the Aotearoa New Zealand context influenced supervision through the discourses of biculturalism and indigenous development, with multiculturalism being a secondary influence; and c) that improvements were needed in the professional and organisational systems that support supervision as well as in the practice and provision of it. The implications and recommendations arising from these findings focus on social work supervision theory and practice, cultural competence and the further development of professional supervision. From these implications it is suggested that the future research and development agenda for social work supervision both internationally and within Aotearoa New Zealand concerns theory-building, responding to the dynamics of culture and difference within supervision and the professionalisation of supervision. The recommendations related to the professionalisation of supervision concern: formal education and training; the role of supervision within organisations and contribution to organisational development; and the need for a stronger evidence-base regarding supervision&#8217;s contribution to client practice and social worker well-being and development.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social work supervision</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functionalised polythiophenes : synthesis, characterisation and applications : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ballantyne, Amy Marisa</field><field name="description">Conducting polymers display properties such as high conductivity, light weight and redox activity giving them great potential for use in many applications. Polythiophenes have proved to be particularly useful because they are readily functionalised and have good chemical stability. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents on the synthesis and properties of polythiophenes. Initial work entailed the synthesis of a series of styryl-substituted terthiophenes. Polymerisation of these materials using both chemical and electrochemical methods was found to produce predominantly short chain oligomers (n &lt; 4) and insoluble material that could not be further processed. An analogous series of styryl-substituted terthienylenevinylene materials were electrochemically oxidised for comparison to the terthiophene series. These materials were also found to produce predominantly dimer and short oligomers, but with the expected higher conjugation length than the corresponding terthiophene oligomers. To enhance polymerisation and increase the solubility of the resulting materials, the polymerisation of styryl-terthiophenes with alkyl and alkoxy functionalities was investigated. The properties of the resulting polymeric materials were determined using electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy and microscopy. The alkoxy substituted polymer was found to have a longer average polymer length than the corresponding alkyl derivative (~n = 11 compared to ~n = 6), but was less soluble (78% compared to 100%). It was found, however, that by increasing the alkoxy chain length from 6 carbons to 10 carbons, the solubility of the polymer could be increased to 97% without affecting the average polymer length. The alkoxy-substituted polymers were observed to be very stable in the oxidised, conducting state compared to the alkyl-substituted polymer, which appeared to be more stable in the neutral, non-conducting state. It was found that these soluble materials could be separated into fractions of different length polymers by using sequential soxhlet extractions in different solvents. Preliminary investigations were made into the suitability of these soluble oligomeric and polymeric materials for use in photovoltaic, actuator and organic battery applications and promising results were achieved for actuator and battery functions. In addition, the solubility of these materials allowed nano- and micro-structured fibre and fibril surfaces to be prepared for use in high surface area electrodes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conducting polymers</field><field name="subject">Terthiophene</field><field name="subject">Oligomers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

A literature review indicated there was a vast amount of information on the mechanisms of the Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) process and its application to domestic wastewaters, but little successful research on its application to dairy processing wastewater. The biodegradability of the wastewater organic fractions was assessed due to their impact on the EBPR process. Continuous anaerobic fermentation tests were used to determine the concentration of volatile fatty acids that could be generated, as these are required for successful EBPR. A fermenter hydraulic retention time of 12 hours and a temperature of 35 &#176;C generated the highest concentration of volatile fatty acids, with an acidification rate of 65% (based on 0.45&#181;m filtered COD). To permit improved dissolved oxygen control and increased flexibility, a multi-zone reactor was designed. A fermentation stage was also incorporated prior to the activated sludge reactor. This reactor was operated with anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones at an SRT of 10 days and stable biological phosphorus removal was achieved. A maximum of 41.5 mg P/L was removed and phosphorus release and PHA storage occurred in both the anaerobic and anoxic zones. The soluble COD consumed in the unaerated zones (anaerobic + anoxic) totalled 484 mg COD/L on the day of the zone study (day 158). The aerobic sludge phosphorus concentration averaged 7.0% mg P/mg VSS after system optimisation. The anaerobic volume was doubled in order to increase the anaerobic consumption of volatile fatty acids. This change increased the amount of soluble COD consumption in the unaerated zones to 632 mg P/L after 40 days but did not result in a significant increase in biological phosphorus removal. In the next series of trials, the concentration of nitrogen in the wastewater was decreased and the anoxic zone removed. This change did not improve the amount of biological phosphorus removal, which was 35 mg P/L at an SRT of 10 days. The effect of different sludge retention times was then investigated. Increasing the SRT to 15 days resulted in little change in phosphorus removal (34.5 mg P/L). Decreasing the SRT to 5 days resulted in the loss of EBPR. The medium term effect on the EBPR process by removing the fermentation stage was also assessed using an AO configuration at an SRT of 10 days. The amount of phosphorus removed decreased slightly after 34 days to 34 mg P/L, but the soluble COD consumed in the anaerobic zone increased to 624 mg P/L. It was concluded that a stable EBPR process could be established when treating a dairy processing wastewater with a continuous activated sludge reactor. The biological stability was sensitive to changes in the solids retention time and the removal of the fermentation stage.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dairy waste</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge reactor</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291102 Bio-remediation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes in the interaction of Epichlo&#235; festucae with perennial ryegrass : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Michelle Kay</field><field name="description">Hydrolytic enzymes degrade macromolecules into smaller components. These enzymes are important in fungal nutrition and have been implicated in the pathogenicity and virulence of pathogenic fungi towards their hosts. However, it is unknown if hydrolytic enzymes play important roles in mutualistic symbioses. In this study, the function of two different classes of hydrolytic enzymes was examined in the mutualistic symbiosis between the fungal endophyte Epichlo&#235; festucae and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Nui). Nine members of a gene family encoding subtilisin-like proteases were identified in E. festucae. The prt2, prt3 and prt5 genes encode putative extracellular proteins belonging to the proteinase K subfamily 1, and prt1 and prt6 encode putative extracellular proteins belonging proteinase K subfamily 2. The prt7 and prt8 genes encoded pyrolysin-like enzymes from subfamilies 1 and 2. The prt4 gene encodes a putative vacuolar protease, while the kex2 gene encodes a putative proprotein convertase. Expression analysis showed that the prt1, prt3, prt5, prt4 and kex2 genes, but not the prt2 gene, were expressed in culture. The prt1 and prt3 genes appeared to be up-regulated in planta compared to culture. The function of prt1 and prt2 in the symbiotum between E. festucae and perennial ryegrass was characterised by expressing these genes under the control of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA or the E. festucae F11 ltmM promoters. No major differences in hyphal or plant morphology were observed between symbioses containing wild type E. festucae or endophyte strains containing the prt1 or prt2 transgenes. The gcnl gene, which encodes a &#946;-1,6-glucanase, was identified immediately downstream of the prt2 gene. The function of the gcnl gene was characterised by gene replacement and testing the phenotype during growth in culture and in planta. E. festucae &#8710;gcnl strains grew normally on glucose-containing media. On media containing the &#946;-1,6-glucan pustulan, &#8710;gcnl strains did not form aerial hyphae or hydrolyse pustulan, which the wild type strain did. This phenotype was partially complemented by growth of the &#8710;gcnl mutant in close proximity to wild type strains, and fully complemented by insertion of the gcnl gene. This suggests that the gcnl gene encodes the major &#946;-1,6-glucanase activity of E. festucae.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endophytic fungi</field><field name="subject">Lolium perenne</field><field name="subject">Mutualistic symbiosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting milk protein concentration and composition of dairy cattle in the sub-tropical regions of northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">David Graham BARBER</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of a Newly Identified Human Rhinovirus: HRV-QPM</field><field name="creator">Mr Peter Mcerlean</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Rhinovirus,&#160;respiratory&#160;illness,&#160;picornavirus,&#160;in&#160;silico&#160;analysis.&#160;</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Men and manliness on the frontier: Queensland and British Columbia in the mid-nineteenth century</field><field name="creator">Hogg, Robert Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frontier and pioneer life -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Frontier and pioneer life -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Equality of opportunity for all?: An assessment of the effectiveness of the Anti-discrimination Act 1991 (Qld) as a tool for the delivery of equality of opportunity in education to people with impairments</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1301 Education Systems</field><field name="subject">330104 Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">Queensland.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specification-based testing of interactive systems</field><field name="creator">Dr Ian Maccoll</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="subject">formal specications, software testing, interactive systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology and Population Ecology of Manta Birostris in Southern Mozambique</field><field name="creator">Andrea Denise Marshall</field><field name="description">Despite being the world&#8217;s largest batoid fish, manta rays have been the focus of very little research in the last century. Almost nothing is currently known about their ecology or distribution throughout the world&#8217;s oceans. Manta rays are considered to be near-threatened to vulnerable by the World Conservation Union&#8217;s Redlist of endangered species, yet many populations still face threats from target fishing for their fin cartilage, branchial filaments and meat. The taxonomic history of the genus Manta has been questionable and convoluted,with Manta having one of the most extensive generic and species synonymies of any living genus of cartilaginous fish. Currently this genus is considered to be monotypicwith a single recognized species, Manta birostris. Behavioural and morphological data collected during this study showed that there are two distinct, sympatric species of manta ray in Mozambique. This discovery has led to an examination of manta ray distribution worldwide, with the two species hypothesis receiving further support from study sites in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This thesis examined large populations of both putative species in Mozambique. Development and application of a photographic-identification methodology allowed identification of individuals based on their unique ventral surface markings (spots). The ability to recognise individuals enabled many aspects of both populations to be examined. A total of 449 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant A and 101 individual rays were identified of Manta birostris variant B. Both populations exhibited a highly significant female bias in observed sex ratios of 1:3.5 and 1:7.4 respectively. The photographic identification approach was used in studies of population size and structure and to examine the reproductive ecology of these two distinct populations. Population estimates incorporating four years of re-sighting data on Manta birostris variant A and five years of data on Manta birostris variant B were conducted using the program MARK resulting in super population estimates of 890 and 600 individuals respectively. The region encompassing the study site was identified as a mating ground for Manta birostris variant A based on observations of mating events and fresh pectoral fin tip scars on female rays produced when the male rays bite onto the fins during copulation. The distribution of scars was highly biased, with 99% on the left pectoral fin, indicative of a strong lateralised behavioural trait in this species. No other elasmobranch has been reported to display behavioural lateralisation. The study region also acts as a birthing ground, with individuals giving birth in the summer after a gestation period of approximately one year. Reproductive periodicity in M. birostris variant A was most commonly biennial, but a few individuals were seen to be pregnant in consecutive years, confirming an annual ovulatory cycle. The production of a single pup appears to be the normal situation, although observations in the wild as well as during opportunistic dissections of individuals killed in fisheries revealed that two pups are conceived on occasion. Morphometric analysis of late-term foetus (M. birostris variant A) was contrasted with measurements taken from adult rays. These are the only detailed measurements on M. birostris variant A from the western Indian Ocean. Predatory scarring and bite injuries on individuals of both variant A and B were consistent with attacks from sharks of various sizes. The frequency and effect of these predatory injuries on the two populations were examined over a three-year period. Acoustic tags were attached to fourteen rays and their presence/absence at sites around the major inshore reefs was explored to evaluate how the rays utilised their environment on a temporal scale. Cleaning activity of both putative species of manta rays by small fishes occurred on these reefs and was considered to be the main reason why the rays were present at these sites. Parasite removal and wound healing were implicated as the benefits received. Host cleaner fish species partition the manta ray body to avoid interspecific competition while the two putative species appear to partition cleaning habitats, with very little overlap apparent. This research on manta rays is the first of its kind in African waters. Many aspects of the study have contributed to the limited baseline data currently available for this genus. The study additionally provided sufficient empirical evidence to warrant the separation of these two putative species of Manta and a full revision of the genus with the systematic examination of specimens throughout Manta&#8217;s range. The results of this study may be useful in this endeavour as diagnostic characteristics have been isolated that may help to differentiate members of this genus. The results of this research study are directly applicable to management strategies for both putative species of manta rays off the East Coast of Africa as well as populations worldwide and have highlighted the potential need for different conservation strategies</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elasmobranch, Manta ray, Population biology, Taxonomy, Morphology, Reproduction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:160974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bioactivity Grafting of Cyclic Peptides: Structure Activity Studies of Grafted Cyclotides and SFTI-1</field><field name="creator">Sunithi Gunasekera</field><field name="description">Peptides are considered as drugs of the future because of their advantageous features of high specificity and low toxicity. However, the complete therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized because of the in vivo instability displayed by most potential peptides. In this thesis, two naturally derived cyclic peptides, cyclotides and sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1), were utilized to impart stability to linear bioactive epitopes and enhance their therapeutic potential in a biological environment. Cyclotides are plant derived mini-proteins with compact folded structures and exceptional stability. Their stability derives from a head-to-tail cyclised backbone coupled with a cystine knot arrangement of three-conserved disulfide bonds. Sunflower typsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) is a stable cyclic peptide containing a single disulfide bond. Taking advantage of these stable cyclic peptide frameworks, novel drug leads to inhibit/stimulate angiogenesis were developed by using the approach of &#8216;epitope grafting&#8217; in which linear epitopes were grafted onto the cyclic peptide frameworks. Angiogenesis is a physiological condition that is unregulated in the progression of many diseases, including cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Thus the drug leads designed in the current project have potential therapeutic applications to combat cancers and cardiovascular diseases. To fully exploit cyclotides as drug scaffolds, it is imperative to understand their folding. Two main subfamilies, referred to as the M&#246;bius and bracelet cyclotides have been identified and interestingly, they require dramatically different in vitro folding conditions to achieve formation of the conserved cyclic cystine knot motif. To determine the underlying structural elements that influence cyclotide folding, the in vitro folding of a suite of hybrid cyclotides based on combination of the M&#246;bius cyclotide kalata B1 and the bracelet cyclotide cycloviolacin O1 was examined in this thesis. The pathways of folding of the two cyclotide subfamilies were found to be different and primarily dictated by specific residues harboured within inter-cysteine loops 2 and 6. Two changes in these loops, an amino acid substitution in loop 2 and an amino acid addition in loop 6 enabled the folding of cycloviolacin O1 under conditions where folding does not occur in vitro for the native peptide. Thus, the study identified key residues that are not in close proximity in the primary sequence or three-dimensional structure which assist folding in cyclotides. A key intermediate species in the folding pathway was isolated and characterised, and found to contain a native-like hairpin structure that appears to be a nucleation locus early in the folding process. The intermediate does not have native disulfide connectivities, but disulfide shuffling processes ultimately lead to a rearrangement to the native form. Overall these mechanistic findings on the folding of cyclotides are potentially valuable for protein engineering applications that utilize cystine-rich peptides as scaffolds in the design of new drug leads. The current study has also enabled the extention of the grafting studies to the bracelet cyclotide subfamily, which was intractable to grafting prior to this work. Cyclotides are gene encoded macrocyclic proteins and another way to exploit their potential as drug scaffolds, would be to develop combinatorial cyclotide libraries. The most efficient way to generate engineered cyclotides would be via recombinant expression, which currently remains unsuccessful, partly due to lack of understanding of the mechanism of cyclotide backbone cyclization. Understanding how the cyclotide precursor folds may provide clues to how cyliclization occurs. A conserved region known as the N-terminal repeat (NTR) region in the cyclotide precursor has been speculated to play an important role in precursor folding. In this thesis, the function of the NTR in the folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro was examined via the design of a series of constructs for the precursor protein for the prototypic kalata B1 cyclotide, with incremental additions of the NTR region. Analysis of the constructs by NMR spectroscopy for evidence of secondary structure revealed that the NTR does not assist folding of the cyclotide precursor in vitro. Using diffusion NMR, the unstructured nature of the constructs was localized to the NTR region. In a complementary study, structural analysis of the full length cyclotide precursor was carried out by expressing the precursor gene for kalata B1 in a bacterial expression system. The full-length precursor was found to be unstructured in solution despite approximately half of the precursor comprising the mature domain and NTR, both of which are structured in isolation. The unstructured nature of the cyclotide precursor suggested that a different environment, or indeed interaction of the NTR with a particular enzyme involved in processing, is necessary for it to adopt a well-defined conformation and allow processing to produce the mature circular protein. The information that NTR alone may not assist folding of the cyclotide precursors has provided new impetus to examine the role of other potential folding auxiliaries such as protein disulfide isomerase in cyclotide folding and has indirectly advanced the production of cyclotides via transgenic means. In summary, this thesis has provided a fundamental insight into the folding of cyclotides, both when expressed as part of a precursor protein and in isolation via solid phase chemical synthesis, and has exploited the potential of cyclic peptide scaffolds in drug design applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cyclotides</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">Grafting</field><field name="subject">Peptides</field><field name="subject">Drug design</field><field name="subject">Folding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:165426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrition and Diet in Roman Britain</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Crane</field><field name="description">The thesis has considered what foods were available to the populations of the Late Iron Age and Roman Britain and the levels of nutrition possible. Evidence for (or the absence of) nutritional deficiency diseases was used to reach conclusions about the standard of health, and knowledge of modern nutritional food models enabled the author to assess the state of health of ancient individuals from a study of the foods to which they had access. To provide a benchmark for what can be ascertained about the Roman&#8217;s choices in food production, selection, cooking, consumption and storage, an examination was made of the sites of Pompeii and Herculaneum, where archaeological investigations have revealed aspects of daily life, trade, living and cooking arrangements, food utensils and human remains. A study of the literary sources determined the attitude of the Romans towards food; it was clear that Romans in the ancient world knew how to source their food, and were aware that, if not properly handled, some food could be detrimental to their health. Sites in Britain from the pre-Roman Iron Age were then considered in regards to food production, selection, cooking and storage, in order to be able to assess the situation after the Roman invasion. For the Roman period, different types of sites were considered: small and larger civilian centres and cemeteries, and military bases. To discover if there were regional differences in diet or nutrition, sites were selected from the North, Midlands, East Anglia, the South and South East and the South West. Also discussed was the role that external influences, features and facilities and occupation of each site had on developing the level of health of their inhabitants. It was found that the native and introduced populations throughout Britain during the Romano-British era did have access to a nutritionally sound food supply, and thus it was possible for them to maintain a healthy diet. Despite the introduction of new foods with the advent of the Romans, there was no discernable difference in the state of health and nutrition from the Iron Age to the Roman, with the exception of dental health, where there was a distinct deterioration as the result of sugar-rich foods being added to the diet. Those cases where the nutritional levels of the people fell below what might be considered conducive to good health were probably due to other factors: it was the physical features or facilities of a settlement (or lack of them) and the occupations and economic status of individuals that actually dictated standards of health.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Roman Britain, Diet, Nutrition, Food, Human Remains, Iron Age, Ancient Sources, Pompeii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:170369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRAIN MAPPING OF ACUPUNCTURE EFFECTS USING FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</field><field name="creator">Mark Strudwick</field><field name="description">There remains a high degree of scepticism about acupuncture since its theoretical basis has no clear reference in Western medical and scientific terms, making any associations between neurophysiology and specific acupuncture concepts difficult to determine. Using neuroimaging and engineering approaches to understand its physiological basis may engender greater acceptance of and improvement in the clinical application of acupuncture. Research into the efficacy of acupuncture has raised a number of difficult methodological issues, particularly in relation to the selection of appropriate controls. Separating specific effects from non-specific effects is complex because acupuncture is a physical, invasive, manual procedure involving time and ritual. Sham acupuncture results show only the difference between sham and real acupuncture not the real affect of acupuncture, and other controls may produce distinct subjective and objective effects. Point injection (the injection of a small amount of a substance at an acupoint), a recent innovation of traditional acupuncture, aims to enhance and prolong the stimulation effect in a standardised, reproducible manner. By providing precise, measurable acupoint stimulation applied incrementally in a specifically designed paradigm, an acupoint could act as its own control. This firstly requires injection to be validated against traditional needling. Aims 1. To develop an instrument for reproducible saline delivery at an acupoint. 2. To cross-validate saline acupoint injection (PI) with traditional needle acupuncture (TA). 3. To demonstrate central nervous system (CNS) effects of acupuncture both in health and chronic pain. Hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that stimulation of specific acupoints with linearly incremental saline injection produces differential effects within the CNS observable with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allowing investigation of acupuncture in health and chronic pain. Novelty As neuroimaging has not yet clearly defined the brain structures that may be modulated by acupuncture, this project is exploratory in nature. It is expected that acupuncture effects can be robustly imaged with fMRI in healthy subjects and those suffering chronic pain. The demonstrated effects will result from the acupuncture process of progressive point stimulation by tissue distension rather than needle insertion or biological noise. It is proposed to examine the putative modulation of pain by acupuncture within the extensively mapped neuromatrix of cortical and subcortical regions, including the somatic, insula, and limbic cortices, and thalamus. Detailed information regarding differences in brain response between acupuncture in normal and diseased states will expand understanding of acupuncture as a clinical tool. The dilemma of sham stimulation or arbitrary controls will be addressed by confirming PI as a valid, reproducible stimulation method. Methods and Results A series of empirical experiments was designed and conducted to determine the effects of stimulation of different acupoints. 1. Chapters 1 and 3 outline the current understanding of acupuncture in the Western milieu and a review of the neuroimaging literature respectively. 2. In Chapter 2, the report of PI tested against TA in healthy volunteers to determine equivalence of physiological effect demonstrates no statistically significant differences between the methodologies. 3. Chapter 4 reports the design and validation of a task specific microprocessor controlled syringe driver. 4. Four differing acupoints were tested during an fMRI experiment described in Chapter 5; different activation areas were demonstrated across the acupoints providing early support for the hypothesis that different acupoints may have different effects. A subset of brain areas recognised within the pain neuromatrix was delineated, congruent spatially and directionally with those reported in pharmacological analgesia studies. 5. As outlined in Chapter 6, heart rate variability can be measured rapidly in a stressful environment to provide meaningful data on the response of the autonomic nervous system to acupuncture stimulation. 6. The hypothesis of different acupoints having different effects was tested in subjects suffering chronic pain by contrasting an accepted and a neutral acupoint, the results being reported in Chapter 7. Conclusion Despite a long history of clinical usage, appropriate scientific studies have not yet addressed the basic effectiveness and efficacy of acupuncture. This thesis presents a series of empirical studies designed to address a number of the questions arising in the literature and provides converging evidence of the manner in which different acupoints modulate the CNS, specifically within the pain neuromatrix.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acupuncture</field><field name="subject">complementary medicine</field><field name="subject">functional magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Neuroimaging</field><field name="subject">central nervous system</field><field name="subject">Peripheral Neuropathy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Modelling of High-Temperature Gas Effects with Application to Hypersonic Flows</field><field name="creator">Rowan Gollan</field><field name="description">During atmospheric entry, a spacecraft's aeroshell uses a thermal protection system (TPS) to withstand severe thermal loads. Heating to the vehicle surface arises as convective, catalytic and radiative heat flux due to the high temperature of the shockwave compressed gases surrounding the aeroshell. The problem for the TPS designer is that the heat load estimates are based on phenomenological models which have questionable validity and, thus, large uncertainty. As an example, recent analyses of heat loads for a proposed aerocapture vehicle designed for Titan differ by up to an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from the complexity of the blunt body flow field and the associated physical effects: thermochemical nonequilibrium; ablation and vehicle surface catalycity; and radiating flow. The motivation for this thesis is to develop computational tools that give accurate estimates of vehicle heat transfer as an input for design calculations. With that goal in mind, this thesis work has focussed on one aspect of this problem and that is the modelling of thermochemical nonequilibrium. The longer term goal is to produce tools which can be used to compute the high-temperature, radiating flow fields about aeroshell configurations; the modelling work presented here on thermochemical nonequilibrium effects is a foundation for tackling the radiating flow problem. The modelling work was implemented in an existing flow solver which solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with a finite volume method. As part of this work, the flow solver was verified by two methods: the Method of Manufactured Solutions to verify the spatial accuracy for purely supersonic flow; and the Method of Exact Solutions --- the flow problem being an oblique detonation wave --- to verify the spatial accuracy for flows with embedded shocks. Validation of the flow solver, without any of the complexity of thermochemical nonequilibrium, was performed by comparing numerical simulation results to experiments which measured shock detachment on spheres fired into noble gases. A model for chemical nonequilibrium based on the Law of Mass Action and using finite-rate kinetics was coupled with the flow solver. The implementation was verified on two test problems. The first treated a closed-vessel reactor of a hydrogen-iodine mixture, and the second computed the chemically relaxing flow behind a normal shock in air. For validation, the implementation was tested by computing ignition delay times in hydrogen-air mixtures and comparing to experimental results. It was found that the selection of a chemical kinetics scheme can complicate validation, that is, a poor choice of reaction scheme leads to poor computational results yet the implementation is correct. As further validation, a series of experiments on the shock detachment distance on spheres fired into air was compared against numerical simulations based on the present work. Two models for species diffusion were also implemented: Fick's first law approximation and the Stefan-Maxwell equations. These models were verified by comparison to an exact solution for binary diffusion of two semi-infinite slabs. The more general problem of thermochemical nonequilibrium was also pursued. A multi-temperature model, one translational/rotational temperature and multiple vibrational temperatures, was developed as appropriate for hypersonic flows. The model uses the Landau-Teller expression to compute the rate of vibrational-translational energy exchange and the Schwartz-Slawsky-Herzfeld expression for vibrational-vibrational energy exchange. The time constants for the rate expressions are estimated by a number of methods such as the use of SSH theory and the Millikan-White correlation. The coupling of vibrational nonequilibrium effects with the fluid dynamics was tested by computing the flow of nitrogen over an infinite cylinder. The simplified problem of a vibrationally relaxing flow behind a shock, without reactions, was compared to other calculations in the literature. This case tested the multi-temperature formulation, with oxygen and nitrogen each being ascribed their own vibrational temperatures. The coupling of chemistry and vibrational nonequilibrium uses the model by Knab, Fruehauf and Messerschmid. The complete model for thermochemical nonequilibrium was verified by calculating the relaxation of oxygen behind a strong shock. The models developed provide a basis for computing radiating flow fields, however the radiating flow problem cannot be attempted based on this work alone. Instead, a more immediate application of the modelling work was the simulation of expansion tube operation. It is desirable to simulate an impulse facility to give the experimenters access to aspects of experiment that are not directly attainable by experiment; especially a complete characterisation of the test flow properties. The modelling work and code development, as part of this thesis, addresses this need of experimenters. Two large-scale simulations are presented as a demonstration of the modelling work: (a) a simulation of an expansion tube in expansion mode; and (b) a simulation of an expansion tube in nonreflected shock tube mode.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">hypersonics</field><field name="subject">atmospheric-entry vehicles</field><field name="subject">high-temperature gas effects</field><field name="subject">nonequilibrium flows</field><field name="subject">expansion tubes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Correlates of Episodic Memory Functioning in Older and Younger Adults</field><field name="creator">Maria Cabral Collerson</field><field name="description">Abstract This study examined memory functioning from a female perspective, with the aim of determining factors that might impact performance and render the accuracy of memory measurement, particularly with advancing age, problematic. Factors investigated, among others, were the role of attention and/or engagement with the memory tasks administered, state affect (i.e., positive and negative arousal) at time of testing, subjective memory appraisal, particularly in the domain of perceived memory self-efficacy (MSE), and the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by older post-menopausal women. Two experimental computer-based tests of episodic memory, Paired Associates (PA) and Serial Recall (SR), were administered to 181 female participants aged 18 to 86 years. The tasks were designed to emphasise components that make episodic memory especially difficult, and minimise the use of strategies that might assist recall. Thus, they varied the requirement for recall as opposed to recognition, the need to form an association between a pair of unrelated words, and the need to discriminate the most recent list from earlier list(s). Other measures used included a demographic survey administered to participants individually in an interview format, and a number of variables examined in this study derived from responses to items contained in this survey. The research battery also included psychometric measures of transient affective states, psychological well-being, alertness, in addition to measures of global cognitive status and metamemory (i.e., subjective memory appraisal). The overall aim was to examine a range of factors that might influence episodic memory performance in cognitively intact healthy women, and thus render the interpretation of age-related changes to memory functioning problematic. For analyses participants were assigned to three groups - young, middle-aged and older. There were 60 young adults aged 18 to 29 years, 60 middle-aged adults aged 49 to 60 years, and 61 older adults aged 61 to 86 years. Each participant was tested individually in a single session lasting approximately 3 &#189; hours, with younger participants requiring less time to complete assessments. Order of test administration and instructions were standardised across the entire sample. Inferential statistics included correlation, t-test statistic, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine key correlates of memory performance outcomes. No significant differences between the cohorts were found in mean years of education. However, episodic memory recall differed significantly by age group. As expected, young adults recalled significantly more words in the memory tasks than their older counterparts, and middle-aged adults outperformed adults in the oldest cohort. Moreover, older adults&#8217; performance deficits were more pronounced in the tasks requiring that they make an association between a pair of unrelated words. Across all cases, transient mood states were significantly related to memory scores; however, individuals in the oldest cohort were particularly vulnerable to mood fluctuations. This cohort experienced a significantly greater decline in positive affect and a significant greater increase in negative affect while undergoing memory testing, highlighting their greater vulnerability to stressors inherent in a memory testing situation. Although scores on the measure of attention were near ceiling, indicative of participants&#8217; level of effort, motivation, and engagement with the memory tasks, the measure of attention discriminated between older and younger adults&#8217; results, and was a key predictor of memory performance. Noteworthy is that attention scores significantly contributed to performance variability in younger and older adults but not in middle-aged adults. Across all cases, age, education, and attention were the key contributing factors to variability in memory scores. Although four lifestyle factors: (1) subjective sleep appraisal, (2) body mass index (BMI), (3) physical activity, and (4) caffeine intake were significantly associated with performance in the memory tasks, once the effects of these key variables were removed, lifestyle factor did not uniquely contribute to performance variability. Moreover, no association was found between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and episodic memory performance across the broader sample. However, in a small subgroup of older women (n = 15, M age = 66 years), long-term users of this treatment, HRT had a significant effect on memory performance and was indicative of better recall on the memory tasks. The effect of subjective memory appraisal, MSE included, on objective performance outcomes was examined. The results showed that memory self-evaluations were not a significant contributing factor to episodic memory performance, confirming that memory self-appraisal is a poor predictor of actual memory performance, and thus does not pose a challenge to the measurement of age-related changes to memory abilities. Although there were commonalities, factors influencing memory performance differed by age cohort. For example, in young adults, positive mood, a perception of sleeping well, subjective health, and attention were significantly related to performance on the memory tasks. However, once the effect of attention was removed in the regression analysis, no other variable was predictive of episodic memory functioning in this cohort. In contrast, the single significant predictor of memory performance in middle-aged individuals was education, and neither attention, nor positive mood, or physical activity had a significant effect on this cohort&#8217;s performance. Similarly, having more years of formal education benefited older adults&#8217; episodic memory functioning. However, high scores on global cognitive functioning and on the tasks measuring attention were equally important to episodic memory recall in this age group. In sum, the significant contribution of age to memory variability attested to the utility of the memory measures in detecting age-related changes to episodic memory functioning, which were independent of deficits in attention or level of education. Moreover, the effect of several factors (e.g., transient mood, lifestyle) on memory scores was explained by an effect on attention, and this has clear implication for the proper evaluation of long-term changes to memory functioning. Limitations of the study and suggestion for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">ageing, episodic memory, attention, cognition, metamemory, memory self-efficacy, estrogen, hormone replacement therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DESIGNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF SYNTHETIC BARRIER MATERIALS FOR THE PROTECTION OF WOODEN STRUCTURES AGAINST TERMITES</field><field name="creator">Sharad Rajendran</field><field name="description">Although termites serve the ecologically important function of converting dead trees into organic matter, they annually cause damage worth billions of dollars to human structures such as houses, power poles and bridges throughout the world. This led to the development of various chemical and physical measures that primarily aimed at preventing the termites from causing damage to wooden structures. While the adverse effects of the chemical methods on the environment and human health has made them widely unacceptable, physical methods are costly and difficult to implement. There is a specific need to develop an environment friendly, cost effective, easily applicable and durable alternative barrier that would effectively protect a wide range of wooden structures. This study aims at designing and developing an eco-friendly, robust and easy to apply barrier material to protect wooden structures. Ether polyurethane (EPU) was chosen as the base material considering its toughness, resilience, hydrolytic stability due to the presence of ether group and easy applicability on large, irregular surfaces. EPU was upgraded to a &#8216;termite effective&#8217; material by the incorporation of a synthetic pyrethroid, Bifenthrin&#174;. Bifenthrin&#174; was chosen over other termiticides due to its less pervasive nature to the environment along with its repellent/ killer effect on termites. The EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system incorporates the specific features of durability of the polymer and slow release of Bifenthrin&#174;, making it more acceptable to the environment and public health. Termite damage resistance of EPU was analyzed by testing the polymer, along with various other polymers (HDPE, PP, PVC and Nylon), with Coptotermes acinaciformes and correlating the termite properties (mandibular force, hardness) with those of the polymeric materials (surface and tensile properties). EPU resisted termite damage, though its softer form incurred 5 times more material damage than the robust cast type. EPUs with high values of hardness incurred ~40% less damage than HDPE and were comparable with the damages on PP. The depth and width of termite damage on HDPE was 5 and 4 times, respectively, than that of PVC. This part of the study inferred that, although hardness of polymeric materials helps prevent termite damage, toughness and resilience too can make it difficult for termites to find a pathway through the material. XPS, FTIR, termite mortality bioassays in an applied setting and elusion tests of Bifenthrin&#174; from EPU in water, acetone and soil were employed to understand the interaction of EPU with Bifenthrin&#174;. Water and soil were chosen as test mediums due to their practical nature. These studies confirm that Bifenthrin&#174; at concentrations as low as 0.5 wt% enriches the surface of EPU due to preferential migration of CF3 group to the surface of EPU. Furthermore, Bifenthrin&#174; incorporated in EPU does not compromise its insecticidal activity and diffuses in a controlled manner at the rate of ~10&#8211;8 cm2 s&#8211;1 and ~10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1 when kept in water and soil media respectively. The durability of EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system was analyzed by conducting degradation studies on EPU. The effect of Bifenthrin&#174; on the ageing of EPU was also investigated. The studies involved ageing of the system in natural and accelerated conditions and validating the results by use of Arrhenius models. The sub-soil conditions do not degrade EPU beyond the oxidative levels as the activation energy required to cause changes in properties of EPU are unphysically small (0.02 kJ mol-1). It was found that EPU can sustain its physical integrity for 12 years at room temperature and Bifenthrin&#174; may remain in a 5 mm thick barrier material for up to 10 years. The effect of Bifenthrin&#174; on the tensile properties of EPU is negligible. Studies to analyze the performance of the barrier material, involved testing of timber coated with the EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system under real-life conditions against termites in field trials located at two tropical locations in Northern Queensland. EPU/ Bifenthrin&#174; system with nominal concentrations of Bifenthrin&#174; incurred no damage when the concentration of Bifenthrin&#174; was above 0.07 wt% in EPU. The degradation of Bifenthrin&#174; under sub-soil conditions is unlikely. Given that favourable characteristics of EPU and Bifenthrin&#174; the design and development an effective and long-lasting termite barrier material seems feasible.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Barrier, Polyurethane, Bifenthrin&#174;, Termites, Biomechanics, Migration, Diffusion, Degradation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration as Transnational Leisure: The Japanese in South-East Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jun Nagatomo</field><field name="description">In the 1990s, the bubble of the Japanese miracle economy burst and the country fell into recession. Following this, Japan experienced considerable economic and social transformation, including a reconsideration of its approach to work and employment. Among the consequences of these changes, such as unprecedented mobility in the labour market and an increase in part-time employment, there was a shift in lifestyle values, particularly those of middle class Japanese. In contrast to the traditional Japanese work ethic and company-orientated lifestyle which prized collectivism and self-sacrifice, new lifestyle values were largely centred on attaining an improved life-work balance which was less structured and more &#8216;Western.&#8217; These new individualised lifestyle values began to be reflected in a new-found interest in leisure, characterised by a shift from group-oriented leisure activities to more individualised and personalised ones. There has been another very significant change of great relevance to this thesis: an increased and unprecedented interest in overseas tourism and migration. This thesis discusses an intriguing new dynamic between the transformation of the economy and the Japanese engagement with tourism and migration. Until the 1990s, due to the guaranteed lifetime employment and the prevalence of seniority systems of Japanese corporations, there was a relatively stable life model among Japan&#8217;s middle class. In addition to healthy demand in the domestic labour market and work-dominated lifestyle, stable work opportunities meant this group rarely considered pursuing individual tourism and migration. However, since the 1990s, increasing numbers of young middle class Japanese began to drift from the safe and assured life model and chose to live abroad. This thesis, based on qualitative methodology and in-depth interviews with 31 Japanese migrants to Queensland, is a study of Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. It draws upon several important topics and theories in contemporary sociology including globalisation, transnationalism, migration and tourism. The complex linkages between these themes are an important characteristic of this thesis and are discussed in the literature review of Chapter 2. The methodological issues of this research are presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contextualises lifestyle migration against the background of broader history of Japanese migration to Australia. The chapters that follow examine three key themes pertinent to exploring the interrelationship between social transformation in Japanese society in the 1990s, changing lifestyle values and migration to Australia. Chapter 5 considers the implications of social transformation of Japanese society, specifically focusing on the lifestyle value shifts as push factors in a broad sense. Chapter 6 explores the pull factors and focuses on motivations for migration to Australia. Chapter 7 examines the lives of Japanese lifestyle migrants in Australia and highlights a unique settlement process characterised by the lack of upward social mobility, the absence of geographical concentration of Japanese migrants and the impact this has on the formation of a sustainable ethnic community. Finally, Chapter 8 summarises the argument of this thesis and discusses its contribution to the field of sociology.

It is written within a framework of the ethnography of speaking, and specifically relates what people say (language form), to its effect on people (language function), examining aspects of context. This ethnographically based language study goes beyond formal details of grammatical structure, presents new data on the Aboriginal use of English, and explores some areas where the conventional grammatical analysis of Standard English does not adequately account for differences between Aboriginal and White Australian uses of English. It also provides evidence which shows that Aboriginal ways of speaking persist in a region where traditional Aboriginal languages are rarely used. The first chapter introduces the study, giving background to the research and motivating the central questions addressed in the thesis. The second chapter provides the theoretical orientation of the thesis, asks its central questions and, after reviewing the ethnography of speaking literature, provides a framework to answer them. The third chapter reviews literature on Australian Aboriginal languages from a sociolinguistic perspective. The fourth chapter provides background information about SEQAB society. The following three chapters treat the SEQAB use of English, each chapter focusing on a specific function of language: the fifth chapter focuses on seeking information, the sixth chapter on giving and seeking reasons for actions, and the seventh chapter on talking about future action. The final chapter concludes that while linguistic forms used by SEQAB speakers of English are mostly shared with White Australian speakers of English, there are crucial differences in meaning which can be understood only in terms of the SEQAB socio-cultural context, including customary intentions of speakers and interpretations of hearers. Considering the data and analysis presented in this thesis, I assert that SEQAB people today use English as an Aboriginal language.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420101 English</field><field name="subject">English language -- Australia</field><field name="subject">English language -- Dialects -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James Tyson 1819-1898 : A man in his environment</field><field name="creator">White, Zita</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tyson, James, 1819-1898</field><field name="subject">Landowners -- Australia -- Biography</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- Australia -- Biography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The inter-relation of settlement and transport in Queensland during the period 1859-1900</field><field name="creator">Courtice, Phyllis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">350400 Transportation</field><field name="subject">Transportation -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Colonization -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The school curriculum: A study of the influence of a social science course on the political and social attitudes of secondary school students in South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">Shipstone, Graham J.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">330200 Curriculum Studies</field><field name="subject">Social sciences -- Study and teaching (Secondary) -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Students -- Queensland -- Attitudes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role relationships and role perceptions of police officers</field><field name="creator">Christie, Gayre</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390400 Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">Queensland.

Nicolau</field><field name="description">Many crucial cellular processes take place at the plasma membrane. The latter is a complex, two-dimensional medium exhibiting significant lateral structure. As a result, a number of non-classical processes, including anomalous diffusion, compartimentalisation and fractal kinetics take place at the membrane surface. The evaluation of various hypotheses and theories about the membrane is currently very difficult because no general modelling framework is available. In this thesis, we present a stochastic, spatially explicit Monte Carlo model for the plasma membrane that accounts for illmixedness, mobile lipid microdomains, fixed proteins, cytoskeletal fence structures and other interactions. We interrogate this model to obtain three classes of results, regarding (1) the effect of lipid microdomains on protein dynamics on the membrane (2) the effects of microdomains, cytoskeletal fences and fixed proteins on the nature of the (anomalous) diffusion on the membrane and (3) the effects of obstructed diffusion on reaction kinetics at the membrane. We find that the presence of lipid microdomains can lead to nonclassical phenomena such as increased collision rates and differences between long-range and short-range diffusion coefficients. Our results also suggest that experimental techniques measuring long-range diffusion may not be sufficiently discriminating and hence cannot be used to infer quantitative information about the presence and characteristics of microdomains. With regard to anomalous diffusion in particular, we find that to explain this phenomenon at the levels observed in vivo, a number of interactions are required, including (but not necessarily limited to) obstacle-induced diffusion and segregation, or exclusion from microdomains. The effects of these different interactions upon the nature of the diffusion appear to be approximately additive. Finally, we show that a widely used non-spatial method, the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, can be modified to take into account anomalous diffusion and that this significantly increases its predictive accuracy. The model presented in this thesis is expected to be of future value in evaluating different models of cell surface processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">membrane</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">lipid rafts</field><field name="subject">anomalous diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The resort development spectrum (RDS): Case study application of the RDS for Cairns, far north Queensland and Bali, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sivijs, Andrew K.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150605 Tourism Resource Appraisal</field><field name="subject">Resort development -- Queensland -- Cairns.</field><field name="subject">Resort development -- Indonesia -- Bali.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literature and cultural policy studies</field><field name="creator">Glover, Stuart</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2001 Communication and Media Studies</field><field name="subject">420202 Australian and New Zealand</field><field name="subject">420302 Cultural Theory</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">Culture -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Popular culture -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Literature and state -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Publishers and publishing -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconciliation on stage: The politics of Indigenous representation in Brisbane theatre's 1999 'reconciliation plays'</field><field name="creator">Western, Melissa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">190401 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Performing Arts</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity in the theater.</field><field name="subject">Reconciliation.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Cultural assimilation.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Drama.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relatedness, host specificity and richness of the genus Ceratomyxa (Myxozoa: Myxosporea) in teleost fishes</field><field name="creator">Nicole Gunter</field><field name="description">The genus Ceratomyxa Th&#233;lohan, 1892 is one of the largest myxozoan genera, the species of which almost always infect the gall bladder of marine teleosts. Although there are over 180 species known globally, prior to this study only three had been described from Australia. This study explores the systematics, host specificity and species richness of Ceratomyxa species from a diverse range of Queensland marine fishes. The first part of this thesis deals with the issues associated with spore based taxonomy and incorporates the first molecular studies to investigate host specificity and radiation in three common families of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) fishes. Twenty-two new species were described in these chapters, and although they were superficially similar in morphology all were genetically distinct. A focus on Ceratomyxa spp. infecting labrid, pomacentrid and serranid fish revealed tight host specificity of parasite species, confirmed the presence of multiple parasite species in a single host and revealed that no parasite radiation had occurred that could be associated with co-evolution with host families. Exploration of intra- and inter-specific variation by sequencing of multiple replicates from host/parasite combinations allowed interpretation of species boundaries within the system. Ten additional species described in Chapter 5 supported the findings from the labrid, pomacentrid and serranid studies but broadened the host range studied. In total 32 Ceratomyxa species were described from Queensland fishes increasing the number of described species in the genus by 15%. This study also reports on undescribed species collected from a further 70 host species and broadens the known host range to seven families of fishes. A checklist of bivalvulidans from marine teleosts in Australia is compiled of described and undescribed species and highlights the abundance of Ceratomyxa relative to other gall bladder dwelling myxosporeans. A phylogeny of the Ceratomyxa based on SSU rDNA analyses explored the taxonomic integrity of the genus. In general, the morphological diagnostic characters that divide the Myxozoa into genera are not well supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses. The relationship between 42 Ceratomyxa spp. and 36 other marine myxosporeans was examined using Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Results indicate Ceratomyxa is one of the most cohesive lineages within the Myxozoa and that the freshwater fish parasite, C. shasta, does not represent an independent lineage as suggested in previous studies. The strict host specificity of Ceratomyxa species prompted the investigation of species richness on the GBR. Species accumulation curves were used to explore species richness by using Choa2 and Jackknife1 estimators. The estimates suggested Ceratomyxa is almost as rich as their teleost hosts and that 1,600 species could be present on the GBR and as many as 15,000 species may exist globally. As an unexpected result, Ceratomyxa may be the richest metazoan genus in the sea. In light of what the study revealed, a revision of a second genus within the family Ceratomyxidae, Leptotheca, is presented. The boundaries between Ceratomyxa and Leptotheca were unclear. The diagnostic characters that separate these genera (length to thickness ratios) were found to be plastic and the type species of Leptotheca ultimately fitted the diagnosis for Ceratomyxa. To eliminate confusion between these genera and also between Sphaerospora and Leptotheca, the genus Leptotheca was considered invalid, with all species appropriately assigned to other genera based on morphological and biological characters and supported by genetic evidence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myxosporea</field><field name="subject">Ceratomyxa</field><field name="subject">Systematics</field><field name="subject">Host Specificity</field><field name="subject">Richness</field><field name="subject">SSU rDNA</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">Fishes</field><field name="subject">Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ASSESSMENT OF LOCATIONAL MARGINAL PRICE SCHEMES FOR TRANSMISSION CONGESTION MANAGEMENT IN A DEREGULATED POWER SYSTEM</field><field name="creator">Muhammad Bachtiar Nappu</field><field name="description">The growth of electricity markets around the world has introduced new challenges in which one of the challenges is the uncertainty that has become a structural element in this new environment. Market players have to deal with it to guarantee the appropriate power system planning and operation as well as its own economical liquidity. Under an open access environment in a deregulated power system, transmission management holds a vital role in supporting transactions between suppliers and customers. Nevertheless, a transmission network has some constraints that should be addressed in order to ensure sufficient control to maintain the security level of a power system while maximizing market efficiency. The most obvious drawback of transmission constraints is a congestion problem that becomes an obstacle of perfect competition among the market participants since it can influence spot market pricing. The system becomes congested when the supplier and customer agree to produce and consume a particular amount of electric power, but this can cause the transmission network to exceed its thermal limits. Congestion can cause the market players to exercise market power that can result in price volatility beyond the marginal costs. Thus, it is important to manage congestion efficiently in the design of a power market. One mechanism that has direct correlation with transmission management is market clearing price (MCP). Under an open access environment, energy prices throughout the network will be different and measured based on transmission constraint and network losses. When network losses are ignored and there is no congestion on the transmission lines, the power price will be the same at all nodes. This is known as uniform marginal pricing (UMP). However, as the power flow violates transmission constraints, redispatching generating units is required and this will cause the price at every node to vary. This phenomenon is defined as locational marginal pricing (LMP). Therefore, the market clearing price has a strong relationship with transmission management, which is needed to be assessed in order to obtain an efficient and transparent price but satisfying all market participants. This project investigates an alternative solution to the dispatch mechanism, and then formulates a new Locational Marginal Price scheme using optimization technique that may well control congestion as the main issue. The model will vary and be improved, to be distilled into energy price, congestion revenue, cost of losses, as well as transmission usage tariff. The objective of the project is to support developing standard market design (SMD) in managing transmission systems which promotes economic efficiency, lowers delivered energy costs, maintains power system reliability and mitigates exercising market power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economic Dispatch</field><field name="subject">Optimal Power Flow</field><field name="subject">Electricity Market</field><field name="subject">Transmission Congestion</field><field name="subject">Deregulated Power System</field><field name="subject">Locational Marginal Prices</field><field name="subject">Transmission Lines</field><field name="subject">Transmission Usage Tariff</field><field name="subject">Transmission Losses</field><field name="subject">Transmission Management</field><field name="subject">Transmission Congestion Management</field><field name="subject">Energy Prices</field><field name="subject">Nodal Pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development, maintenance and evaluation of a citizen advocacy programme</field><field name="creator">O'Brien, Patricia Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160702 Counselling, Welfare and Community Services</field><field name="subject">111709 Health Care Administration</field><field name="subject">People with mental disabilities -- Home care -- Victoria -- Burwood</field><field name="subject">Social service -- Victoria -- Burwood</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professional socialisation of librarians in Queensland</field><field name="creator">White, James Joachim</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0807 Library and Information Studies</field><field name="subject">080706 Librarianship</field><field name="subject">Librarians -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Job satisfaction -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling studies in the Australian sugar industry</field><field name="creator">Wegener, Malcolm Keith</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">070105 Agricultural Systems Analysis and Modelling</field><field name="subject">Decision making -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Sugarcane -- Australia -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl without hands: extract from the manuscript of a novel. The Maiden without hands: from folktale and fairy ale to contemporary novel</field><field name="creator">Melissa Ashley</field><field name="description">The Girl without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel By Melissa Jane Ashley Abstract The major component of the thesis is an extract from the manuscript, The Girl without Hands, a novelised interpretation of the folktale and fairy tale, The Maiden without Hands. The novel is composed of three books, with point of view structured as shifting third person; most of the story is narrated by the central character, Marina Fischer. The manuscript deploys a variety of fairy tale and folktale related literary techniques, including magic realism, intertextuality, framing, and fantasy. Events span a period of eight years, the action set in rural and urban parts of Queensland and Victoria. On an unsupervised picnic with friends, fourteen year old Marina Fischer&#8217;s twin sister Sonia suffers a fatal head injury. Grief-stricken and self-blaming, Marina reacts to the trauma by losing all feeling and movement in her hands. Six months following the accident, Marina seems on the verge of recovery; she attends regular therapy and is protected by her loyal friends, siblings Amelia and Sammy Jones. However, the patina of stability begins to crack when Marina is confronted at the year ten formal by Sonia&#8217;s former associates, Kylie Bates and Jody Cutter, also present at her death. Distraught and upset, Marina flees the dance in Jody&#8217;s older brother&#8217;s car. Seven years later Marina meets Matt Soverign, a gifted hypnotist, who tries to help her regain movement in her hands. They sleep together and Marina unexpectedly falls pregnant. Their son Tristram is born while Matt attends an interstate conference. Thinking a child would help her hands to heal, Marina becomes depressed when she continues to suffer from paralysis. She begins to dwell on memories of her sexual assault the night of the school dance, slowly losing touch with reality. But a phone call from her estranged friend, Amelia Jones, shakes Marina out of her stasis. Her close mate Sammy, who now lives in Melbourne, has fallen dangerously ill. With her relationship in pieces, Marina purchases train tickets for herself and Tristram and embarks upon a spontaneous&#8212;though much delayed&#8212;journey to reconcile the past. The critical component of the thesis is an essay entitled &#8220;The Maiden without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel&#8221;. Chapter one, &#8220;The Tale is Not Beautiful if Nothing is Added to It,&#8221; is a literary survey of cross-cultural folktale and fairy tale variants of the 1200 year old narrative, The Maiden without Hands. I explore academic debate regarding the literary fairy tale&#8217;s indebtedness to the oral folktale, discussing Susan Stewart&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;distressed text&#8217; and Lewis Seifert&#8217;s theory of &#8216;nostalgic recuperation.&#8217; Chapter two, &#8220;Then the Devil Will Take Me Away,&#8221; undertakes a close reading of the Grimm Brothers&#8217; influential but controversial 1857 re-write of The Maiden without Hands narrative. I suggest that Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s suppression of the &#8216;unnatural father&#8217; episode, found in the traditional folktale, aided the story&#8217;s survival in and beyond the nineteenth century, when such themes became taboo. I explore how the Grimms&#8217; aesthetic revisions of folk material&#8212;to make them appeal to a middle class audience, including children&#8212;helped proliferate stereotyped representations of females and femininity in classic fairy tales. These depictions, I argue, often cause ambivalence in contemporary female readers, however they also instigate creative revisionary projects (such as my own), which seek to explore the residual energy contained in fairy tale texts, while at the same time destabilising their sexual stereotyping. In the last chapter, &#8220;The Only Thing She Doesn&#8217;t Have is Arms,&#8221; I discuss how extensive research into the many incarnations of The Maiden without Hands altered my understanding of the narrative&#8217;s symbols, tropes and metaphors, leading to significant changes to the plot of my novel. Citing examples from my text, The Girl without Hands, and comparing and contrasting them with excerpts from variants of the folktale and fairy tale, I analyse my creative interpretation of The Maiden without Hands&#8217; major themes: loss and lack; sexual assault and violation; creativity and writing; and, finally, healing and wholeness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Fairy tale</field><field name="subject">Folktale</field><field name="subject">The Girl without Hands</field><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Novel</field><field name="subject">Conversion Disorder</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical appraisal of the inter-relationship of the tourism industry and the wine industry: An analysis of wine tourism on the Granite Belt area in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Catherine M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1506 Tourism</field><field name="subject">070604 Oenology and Viticulture</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Wine industry -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imagining Brisbane: Narratives of the city 1975-1995</field><field name="creator">Muller, Vivienne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">200502 Australian Literature (excl.

Concomitant with agricultural landscape modification are the processes of habitat loss and fragmentation, which are major causes of species&#8217; extinctions, population declines and altered ecosystem functions. However, in many tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions, abandoned agricultural lands are reverting to regrowth or secondary forest, which represents an important opportunity for passive landscape restoration. Regrowth may be particularly important in highly modified landscapes, where the area of mature forest may be insufficient to support viable plant and animal communities without some form of restoration. Some studies of fauna populations in regrowth forest have found recovery of species richness within several decades, although recovery of species composition may take at least 100 years and some species may be permanently lost. While these findings are encouraging, they generally fail to account for the landscape context in which regrowth occurs and focus mainly on tropical forests. The aim of this thesis was to advance the understanding of fauna recovery in regrowth forests on abandoned agricultural land by: i) comparing woodland bird communities in a replicated chronosequence of semi-arid sub-tropical regrowth forests; and ii) quantifying how the ecological values of regrowth habitat vary among stand-, patch- and landscape-levels of ecological organisation. A review of 68 studies of fauna recovery in regrowth forests, revealed that current knowledge is limited by the predominance of studies conducted: in tropical rainforests; with minimal replication of sites; in landscapes within proximity of large tracts of relatively undisturbed mature forests; and with limited consideration of the influence of the spatial context on fauna recovery in regrowth forest. This study makes a significant contribution to understanding fauna recovery in regrowth forests by quantifying the recovery of estimated bird species richness to levels similar to mature forest, within a period of 30-60 years, in highly modified semi-arid agricultural landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. An ordination of the similarity in species composition among forest types also suggested that after 30-60 years regrowth bird communities are more similar to mature brigalow forest than the younger regrowth. This is important for the recovery of brigalow ecosystems, an endangered ecological community where regrowth is currently given minimal protection from further clearing. Comparisons of the importance of habitat attributes using model averaging and hierarchical partitioning of generalised linear models of the species richness of woodland birds showed that bird species richness was positively associated with patch age, and that stand-level factors such as grazing disturbance and the abundance of mistletoes (Amyema spp.) were also important. The spatial context of vegetation patches (size, shape and isolation) was equally important for bird species richness, with more species of woodland dependent, nectar/frugivores and non-ground foraging insectivores occurring in less modified landscape contexts, and the converse for generalist species, ground foraging insectivores and granivores. While a number of woodland dependent bird species known to be in decline in temperate woodlands of southern Australia were absent or rare in regrowth forests, several species (e.g., eastern yellow robin) also occupied regrowth habitats. This finding suggests that these more sensitive species may respond positively to landscape restoration through targeted retention of brigalow regrowth. The landscape-level amount of forest varied in importance among regrowth age classes and bird groups. In general, the amount and number of mature forest patches in the landscape were of lower importance than local attributes. However, the amount of mature forest and old regrowth (&gt; 30 years) in the landscape did have an important positive influence on the number of woodland bird species and species&#8217; abundance; suggesting that regrowth is making an important contribution to landscape recovery in the study area. Mistletoe abundance was strongly dependent on particular species of frugivores for seed dispersal (e.g., mistletoebird, spiny-cheeked honeyeater and painted honeyeater), and varied considerably among three sub-regions of the study area. In general, mistletoe abundance increased in linear patches and more highly modified landscapes but was also dependent on the abundance of seed dispersers and brigalow stand condition. These findings suggest that narrow linear patches in brigalow landscapes can have important conservation values for woodland birds. The study outcomes have important implications for research and management of regrowth vegetation, both within Australia and internationally. From an international perspective, the study highlights the need for greater consideration of the importance of regrowth forest in a landscape context for conserving and restoring fauna communities. From an Australian perspective, the study provides important baseline information for the conservation and management of woodland bird habitat in fragmented brigalow landscapes. Prior to this research, very little was known on the spatial ecology of woodland birds in the region. The study highlights the important conservation values of small and often linear mature brigalow patches for woodland birds and the considerable potential for restoration of habitat for a diverse range of species through the retention of regrowth vegetation. In particular, the research outcomes suggest that targeting the retention of regrowth towards increasing the size and reducing the isolation of mature brigalow forests may be an effective strategy to maximise biodiversity benefits. Brigalow regrowth stands will need to be retained for at least 60 years and probably longer to maintain viable woodland bird communities. For this to happen on a regional-scale, brigalow regrowth needs to be given greater recognition for potential biodiversity benefits either within a legislative framework or by incentive schemes to promote the long term persistence of regrowth habitat within the landscape.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">land abandonment</field><field name="subject">Regrowth</field><field name="subject">fauna recovery</field><field name="subject">woodland birds</field><field name="subject">agricultural landscape</field><field name="subject">Habitat Loss</field><field name="subject">habitat fragmentation</field><field name="subject">spatial pattern</field><field name="subject">Acacia harpophylla</field><field name="subject">brigalow</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Romanian Folk Music on the Music of George Enescu, with special reference to Romanian Rhapsody, op. 11 no. 1, Sonata for Violin and Piano, op. 25 no. 3, and Impression d&#8217;Enfance for Violin and Piano, op. 28.</field><field name="creator">Michael Patterson</field><field name="description">George Enescu (1881-1955) is the best-known Romanian composer and has been widely lauded for his folk- inspired compositions. While folk music was an important influence in Enescu&#8217;s music, it was always balanced by his passion for and intimate understanding of late Romantic compositional techniques. The extent to which he was influenced by the folk music of his homeland is a point of contention amongst some of the leading Enescu scholars. The English-speaking representative, Noel Malcolm believes that the influences in Enescu&#180;s musical language were more diverse than scholars have suggested prior to the 1989 revolution. He believes that the depiction of Enescu as a folkloristic composer has contributed to his marginalisation and relative obscurity. By contrast, scholars such as Boris Kotlyarov and Grigore Constantinescu give greater weight to national characteristics in Enescu&#8217;s music. Enescu conceded that some of his early works made direct quotation of Romanian folk melodies, and that such an approach was limited in its possibilities. The composer&#8217;s more mature works employ characteristics of folk music and its performance traditions without the use of direct quotation. This critical commentary will observe and comment on the folk influences in Enescu&#8217;s compositions as well as noting the influence of Western traditions and techniques. Due reference will be given to the work of Bart&#243;k, whose incisive study of Romanian folk music remains one of the most substantial and detailed primary sources today. In order to highlight specific examples of folk influence, as well as other techniques, three of Enescu&#8217;s works are targeted for specific study, namely the Romanian Rhapsody, op. 11 no. 1, Sonata for Violin and Piano, op. 25 no. 3 and his Impressions D&#8217;Enfance for violin and piano, op. 28. Each work exhibits a tie with the composer&#8217;s Romanian origins, but also with 19th and early 20thC composers such as Brahms, Wagner, Debussy and Faur&#233;. This critical commentary highlights the fact that Enescu&#8217;s works display folk idioms and techniques developed using late-Romantic techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enescu, folk, music, compositions, Romania, Romanian, composer, traditional, Bart&#243;k</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology Server for Ontology-based Interoperation of Information Systems</field><field name="creator">Mohammad Ahmad</field><field name="description">In order for information systems supporting two different organizations to interoperate, there must be an agreement as to what the words mean. Such an agreement is often called an ontology, or description of a shared world (a.k.a domain ontology). An ontology in general is an agreed understanding (i.e. semantics) of a certain domain, axiomatized and represented formally as logical theory in a computer resource. It can enable semantic interoperability where autonomous and distributed applications can meaningfully communicate to exchange data and interoperate independently of their internal technologies. The main goal of this thesis is twofold. First (general sense), it presents a specification for ontology engineering to guide ontology designers towards building ontology supporting interoperation of information system using a standard modeling approach. Second (specific sense), it presents a specification for what the ontology server is going to serve at commit-time. At this time, the server is used to assist players to obtain a portion of an ontology relevant to their interoperation requirement. First, we investigate the definition of an ontology as a specification of a conceptualization by showing that an ontology supporting interoperating information systems can be seen as the result of interlocking institutional worlds (IWs). An institutional world is the collection of integrated speech acts and consequent institutional facts made by a particular institution. This institutional world is the conceptualization of which the ontology is the specification. To be more specific, we call this ontology is a domain ontology of IWs. Second, we specify a software system, an ontology server needed to support domain ontology of IWs at commit-time for ontology engineering: 1) Commit-time requirements for an ontology server and 2) Ontology view extraction. The commit-time requirement is a functional requirement of the server to assist a player to obtain a relevant portion of an ontology. The discussion of this requirement has led to research into ontology view extraction. Based on the notion of formal ontology, our approach to ontology view extraction takes into accounts both endurants (entities that exist in time) and perdurants (entities that happen in time). Making a link to the domain ontology of IWs, the speech act is an example of event perdurant, while the institutional fact is an example of endurant. That is, our ontology view extraction involves perdurant ontology (ontology of speech acts) and endurant ontology (ontology of institutional facts). The principal contribution of this work is our technical solution for ontology view extraction. Based on an existing structural metamodel for modeling endurant ontology developed by Guizzardi, we present a technique using existential dependency for endurant extraction starting from a seed provided by the user. Since the user wants to commit to the ontology in order to interoperate with other players, the endurant seed is derived from the actions the user wants to perform, which are described in the perdurant ontology. Our metamodel for perdurant ontology is based on an existing business process metamodel for modeling speech acts, namely, Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The seed is the institutional facts involved in the speech acts the user wants to perform. These strategies have been implemented by extending with profiles the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Generally, the perdurant ontology is represented by the UML activity diagram, while the endurant ontology is represented by the UML class diagram. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we develop several collections of running examples based on an extended hypothetical ontology for the Olympic Games. This research is a contribution to the theory of conceptual modeling by proposing a set of specifications that can be used to model domain ontology of IWs. The specification here can be understood from two perspectives: 1) Metamodel and 2) Model. The former is addressed at meta-level which consists of metaconcepts for the languages in which the ontologies are represented. The latter is the resulting specification when these metaconcepts are used to represent some aspect of the reality or world in the domain of IWs. Most importantly, the work here contributes to the ontology server research since the view extraction based on the metamodel is what the server is going to serve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of Grain storage protein digestibility in sorghum.</field><field name="creator">Phuong Mai Hoang</field><field name="description">Abstract Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the world&#8217;s fifth most common cereal crop and provides an important source of staple food in the semi-arid tropics and feed in many other countries. The plant has the ability to grow and yield in hot and dry climates. However, sorghum grain is less digestible than the other major staple crops such as rice, wheat and maize. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum grain by applying cutting-edge biotechnologies which involve the use of tissue culture and genetic transformation. Recently, Agrobacterium has been used by many researchers to introduce foreign genes into the sorghum genome. This method has some advantages compared to particle bombardment, however, one limitation is the regeneration of transgenic tissues. In this study successfully transformed sorghum using Agrobacterium and regenerated transgenic plants via an organogenic tissue culture system is reported. The results of transformation efficiency were achieved with co-cultivation after 48 hours. Regeneration of the sorghum transgenic plants was improved by using organogenic tissues. The GUS reporter gene and the Hpt and bar selectable markers were used. Southern blots and PCR were used to confirm transgene presence in the T0 and T1 generations. In this study, stable transgenic sorghum plants have been produced. The factors found to most influence Agrobacterium transformation were the type of organogenic tissue from different genotypes. The genotypes and the period of co-cultivation, as well as the selectable marker gene and selection strategy used. However, the transformation efficiency from this method was low (1.12%) compared with the previous efficiencies published for Agrobacterium-mediated sorghum transformation. Therefore, to improve the transformation efficiency for this method further work may need to be done. Thioredoxin genes were transformed into the sorghum genotype 296B by particle bombardment. In the first experiment no transgenics over-expressing trx and ntr were confirmed by Southern blot. In subsequent experiments, a limited number of transgenics of the T1 generation were confirmed and used for further analysis. A transgenic line with both trx &amp; ntr was created by crossing a trx line and a ntr line. The 2 genes in this line were confirmed and showed different levels of expression by Real Time PCR. Also, the level of expression in the T2 hybrid plants was higher compared to the T1 parents. The grains from the transgenic lines were different in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting properties and in-vitro digestibility. The ntr line was confirmed to be more digestible than the other transgenic lines and a non-transgenic line. There was a significant increase of 11% (P=0.02) in digestibility of the sorghum ntr line over the non-transgenic. However, the transgenic sorghum seeds did not germinate after storage for more than 6 months. Differences in the morphology of the starch granules and protein matrix of the transgenic lines when compared to non-transgenic were observed with Scanning Electron microscopy. The difference was observed from the transition to the central zone. Pores appeared in the starch granules of the sorghum transgenic lines, but not in the non-transgenic. This may be directly related to the changes in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting and digestibility. To find regulatory sequences which can direct expression of transgenes in developing endosperm, the &#946;-kafirin promoter was identified and cloned. Two constructs of varying length were made to test tissue specificity of the promoter, by replacing the Ubi promoter of the pUBIGUS vector. The GUS gene was used as the marker gene under the control of the amplified &#946;-kafirin promoter. The result was determined on different explants of sorghum by transient expression via particle bombardment. The result shows the successful identification of the &#946;-kafirin promoter region and its effect on transient expression levels. Agrobacterium transformation of sorghum organogenic tissue was developed. The digestibility of grain sorghum was improved by over-expressing the thioredoxin genes. In conclusion, the sorghum grain digestibility can be improved by transforming sorghum with thioredoxin genes, via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Further experimentation is required to identify regulatory sequences to optimise transgene expression in sorghum endosperm. In order to determine the reason behind the difficulties of seed germination, larger numbers of independent transgenic lines need to be generated and tested to determine whether over-expression of trx &amp; ntr always has detrimental effects on seed longevity and germination.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorghum transformation, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase over-expressed, Agrobacterium-mediated, organogenic tissue, &#946; -kafirin promoter.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chaplaincy in Queensland state schools: An investigation</field><field name="creator">Salecich, Judith Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160506 Education Policy</field><field name="subject">440207 Religion and Society</field><field name="subject">750401 Religion and society</field><field name="subject">Church work with students</field><field name="subject">School chaplains -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Innovation in Professional Service Firms</field><field name="creator">Suellen Hogan</field><field name="description">Increasingly the services sector is seen as important to economic development. In recent years competition has increased within this sector, in particular, within the professional service sector. Consequently, as competition increases service firms need to provide value for clients and need to differentiate their service offerings from those of competitors. In other words, service firms must be innovative in order to attain and maintain profitable organisational performance. Innovation is seen as a core capability, and a key source of competitive advantage. Nonetheless, despite the importance of innovation to all organisations, prior research has focused on manufacturing and high-technology industries. While this has contributed to our understanding of innovation within these industries, the role and significance of innovation in service industries is less well understood. Importantly, our understanding of innovation within the professional service sector is underdeveloped. This research addresses this significant gap. The aim of the thesis is to create new knowledge by providing a clearer understanding of the organisational innovation capabilities and their effects on organisational performance within professional service firms (PSFs). Specifically, the research is designed to: (1) develop and validate an organisational innovation capabilities scale for PSFs; and (2) model the relationships between dimensions of organisational innovation capabilities and dimensions of organisational performance in PSFs. An integrated multi-methods research program was undertaken. First, a critical review of relevant literature was conducted to identify the key constructs and theories on organisational innovation. Second, Study 1 consisted of thirty-seven semi-structured in-depth interviews with professional service providers. The key objective of Study 1 was to determine the types of innovation capabilities specific to PSFs. Additionally, the interviews assisted in refining constructs for the conceptual model. Third, Study 2a involved the development of a multi-dimensional innovation capabilities scale for PSFs (n = 255) which was validated on a sample of professional executives (n = 208). Refinement of existing organisational performance measures was also carried out. Fourth, Study 2b tested the hypothesised relationships of the structural model, and provided insights into the firm characteristics that influence organisational innovation capabilities. The findings of this research highlight the importance of innovation within a professional service context. Specifically, this research found that the ability to innovate is viewed as a way to add value for clients, differentiate the firm and the firm&#8217;s services and products and to attain competitive advantage. Professional service innovation capabilities was found to be a multi-dimensional construct comprised of client-centred solutions, marketing strategy and technology innovation capabilities. The results support a positive and significant relationship between client-centred solutions innovation capability and customer performance, and in turn, firm performance. The results also support a positive and significant relationship between marketing strategy innovation capability and firm performance. Interestingly, no support was found for a relationship between technology innovation capability and firm performance. Further, PSFs in country and regional areas had a higher level of total innovation capability and technology innovation capability than their city counterparts. Small PSFs, where the total number of employees was approximately three, and whose main client-base were individual or corporate clients had a higher level of client-centred solutions innovation capability. Finally, the findings and frameworks developed in this thesis provide a basis for the development of a clearer understanding of the conceptual and empirical links between organisational innovation capabilities and performance outcomes within the professional service firm context, thus contributing to theory and practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Innovation, Professional Service Firms, Strategic Capabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Treadmill Walking at High Intensity During Rehabilitation Following Stroke</field><field name="creator">Suzanne Kuys</field><field name="description">The majority of people with stroke regard walking in their community as very important (Lord et al 2004). Walking in the community is limited by slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity (Lord et al 2004; Patterson et al 2007). Slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity are identified sequela in people with stroke (Hill et al 1997). By the end of rehabilitation approximately 80% of people with stroke achieve independent walking (Dean &amp; Mackay 1992; Hill et al 1997). However, less than 10 percent are able to easily walk in their community (Hill et al 1997). Optimal motor learning requires task-specific practice (Carr &amp; Shepherd 2003). Treadmills offer the opportunity for repetitive practice of complete gait cycles (Shepherd &amp; Carr 1999), potentially providing greater intensity and longer duration walking practice than usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Recently there has been some suggestion that high-intensity interventions may improve walking in people with stroke (Moseley et al 2005). Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in people with stroke have been shown to impact on walking, in particular walking capacity (Kelly et al 2003). Treadmills, commonly used to retrain cardiorespiratory fitness in the healthy population, have been used to implement high-intensity interventions, improving cardiorespiratory fitness in people with chronic stroke (Macko et al 2005). Therefore it is possible that exercise aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness may improve walking in people with stroke. The aim of these four studies was to investigate in those following stroke if walking on a treadmill at high-intensity during inpatient rehabilitation could improve walking capacity without compromising pattern and quality. The first study determined, in an Australian setting, the duration and intensity of usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Study 2 compared walking pattern immediately following overground and treadmill walking practice at the same intensity. Study 3 examined the effect of treadmill walking at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness on walking pattern and quality. The final study, investigated the feasibility of implementing a high-intensity treadmill intervention in addition to usual physiotherapy rehabilitation in people following stroke able to walk undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Intensity in all studies was calculated using heart rate reserve or the Karvonen method. Heart rate is a valid, accurate and stable indicator of exercise intensity due to its relatively linear relationship with oxygen consumption (ACSM 2006). For those people taking beta-blocker medication, the heart rate-lowering effect of this type of medication was accommodated. A target intensity of 40% heart rate reserve was used; as this is the minimum required improve cardiorespiratory fitness (ACSM 2006). Walking pattern and quality were measured in Studies 2-4. Walking pattern was measured by linear kinematics using GAITRite (CIR Systems, Clifton, NJ, USA) and angular kinematics using a 2-dimensional webcam application. Walking quality was determined by observation of the webcam footage and scored using the Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Wisconsin Gait Scale and a vertical visual analogue scale by blinded assessor. The first study found that people with stroke spent an average of 21 (SD 11) minutes participating in standing and walking activities that are associated with reaching the target intensity during physiotherapy rehabilitation. Those who could walk spent longer in these activities (25 minutes, SD 12) compared to those would couldn&#8217;t walk (17 minutes, SD 9). However, the intensity of these activities was low; walkers reached a maximum of 30% heart rate reserve and non-walkers reached 35% heart rate reserve. Using the treadmill as a mode of task-specific physiotherapy rehabilitation, the second study in this thesis found that walking pattern was similar following 10 minutes of treadmill and overground walking practice at the same intensity. The third study found that during walking on the treadmill at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (up to 60% heart rate reserve), many of the linear and angular kinematic parameters moved closer to a more normal pattern and walking quality was not compromised. The final study in this thesis, a randomised controlled trial, found that a 6-week high-intensity treadmill walking intervention was feasible in people with stroke able to walk who were undergoing rehabilitation. Participants attended 89% of the treadmill sessions, reaching an average duration of more than 20 minutes and an intensity of 40% heart rate reserve after two weeks. The intervention also appeared effective with significant improvements in walking speed and capacity following the treadmill walking intervention. Improvements in walking speed were maintained at 3 months. In summary, these studies found that usual physiotherapy in people with stroke was of low intensity. In addition, it was found that treadmill walking was safe and feasible as a means of increasing the intensity of physiotherapy rehabilitation, without compromising walking quality and pattern. Therefore, it may be possible to improve walking in people with stroke using high-intensity treadmill walking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation"

Peptide-based Vaccines against Group A Streptococcal infections</field><field name="creator">Abu-Baker Mustafa Abdel-Aal El-Sayed</field><field name="description">Vaccination comes second in importance after introduction of clean water as a public health intervention which has largely contributed in the reduction of deaths from infectious diseases. Success in the development of a group A streptococcal (GAS) vaccine is expected to save 517 000 deaths per annum according to a recent independent review commissioned by the world health organization (WHO) and would offer an ideal means to prevent rheumatic heart disease (responsible for the greatest health burden) and other GAS-associated diseases which affect the health of 600 million. Traditional vaccine approaches (killed or live attenuated) have demonstrated great success against many bacterial and viral infectious diseases, crowned by the global eradication of smallpox announce by the WHO in 1980 and near-to-be announced eradication of polio viral disease. However, application of traditional techniques in many cases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, GAS and Mycobacteria tuberculosis, has not shown the same success. Risk associated with the use of live&#8211;attenuated pathogens, such as recurrence of virulence (e.g. HIV), development of autoimmune diseases (e.g. GAS), and difficulties of manufacture hindered the use of such approaches. Other vaccine approaches such as subunit vaccines (recombinant proteins) and carrier conjugated vaccine are also hindered by the lack of suitable adjuvants, carriers and delivery systems. The current thesis focused on the design, synthesis and evaluation of novel adjuvants and vaccine delivery systems against GAS. The first chapter reviews recent approaches in the field of GAS vaccine design and new findings in immunology which represent the basis of our novel strategies. The second chapter describes the design, synthesis and evaluation of a novel library of lipopeptides as self-adjuvanting GAS vaccine candidates, composed of: (i) a universal helper T-cell epitope (P25), (ii) a target GAS B-cell epitope (J14), and (iii) a lipid moiety. Systemic J14-specific IgG antibodies were detected following subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c (H-2d) mice with each construct without the need for an additional adjuvant. The effect of changing the order of P25, J14, and lipid moiety attachment, or incorporation of P25 and J14 into a lipid-core peptide system (LCP) on antibody titers was assessed. The point of lipid moiety attachment had the greatest influence on systemic J14-specific IgG antibody titers. Overall, the best vaccines featured a C-terminal lipid moiety, conjugated through a lysine residue to P25 at the N-terminus, and J14 on the lysine side-chain. Mucosal surface of the nasal-oral route is a primary site of GAS infections. An ideal GAS vaccine would have to elicit both mucosal as well as systemic immune responses and hence would not only prevent the development of GAS-associated diseases but also would prevent primary GAS infections. Therefore, the nasal route is considered a highly promising route of vaccine administration to provide local as well as systemic immune responses against pathogens that utilize mucosal surface as site of infection. The third chapter includes immunological assessment of the lipopeptide vaccine library described in the second chapter following intranasal immunization of B10BR (H-2k) mice. The whole library was first investigated in a small scale experiment (5 mice per group) to select promising candidates which demonstrate the best local and systemic J14-specific antibodies. Four selected lipopeptides were further investigated in a larger scale experiment (15 mice per group) followed by intranasal challenge of vaccinated mice with a virulent GAS M1 strain. The best local and systemic immune responses were demonstrated by a lipopeptide featuring a lipid moiety consisting of two 16 carbon chains incorporated at the C-terminus of the lipopeptide. However, this candidate did not achieve protection against bacterial challenge. The best protection (100%) was shown by a lipopeptide candidate featuring a C-terminal J14, conjugated through a lysine residue to P25 at the N-terminus, and a lipid moiety on the lysine side-chain. A possible explanation for these results was investigated where antibodies elicited by the former candidate was found to better recognize the minimal B-cell epitope in the native p145 sequence of the M protein. Circular dichroism study of lipopeptides used in the previous experiment demonstrated that the former candidate features &#945;-helical conformation which is required to produce protective J14-specific antibodies. Further studies are needed to explain structural features required to achieve both &#945;-helicity and strong mucosal immune responses shown by the previously mentioned two lipopeptides. Signaling through toll-like receptors expressed by immune cells was recently shown to result in a robust immune response and was investigated as a possible mode of action for our novel lipopeptides. The fourth chapter introduces our lipopeptide vaccine approach as novel synthetic ligands targeting TLR2. A lipid moiety consisting of two alkyl chains of 16 carbons was found to achieve optimal TLR2 signaling regardless of the position of lipid attachment. Carbohydrates as polyhydroxy compounds provide an easily accessible class of compounds to design scaffolds (carriers) to attach lipids and peptide epitopes in different number and stereochemical positions which makes glycolipopeptides an attractive target for adjuvant research and structure-adjuvanticity relationships studies. The Fifth chapter reports immunological assessment of two series of glycolipopeptides as GAS vaccine candidates and novel vaccine delivery systems. The first series: lipid carbohydrate core peptide system (LCCP); represents a modification of the classical LCP system where polylysine dendrimer is replaced by different monosccharides as carriers for peptide antigens. LCCP analogues induced proper humoral immune responses against incorporated epitopes comparable to the LCP delivery system and as strong as the immune response elicited by CFA mixtures. Moreover, LCCP delivery system has been proved to be tolerant to the use of different epitopes as well as changing carbohydrate cores. Design of novel carbohydrate cores with different orthogonal protecting groups is needed to explore the potential advantage of various stereochemical arrangements provided by monosaccharides. The second series of glycolipopeptides incorporates various glycolipid moieties (self-adjuvanting activity) covalently coupled to the N-terminus of J8 (a model epitope). The new glycolipopeptide vaccine candidates (containing only one copy of J8) bear comparison with an LCP analogue (containing four copies of J8) which would improve the ease of synthesis, purification and cost of vaccine production. The slight difference in immunogenicity among these glycolipopeptides was difficult to be explained due to intervening effects of both the number and orientation of lipids on immunological activity. Further investigation is needed to determine the contribution of each factor.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaccine, immunity, group A streptococcus, lipopeptides, glycolipopeptides, glycolipids, toll-like receptor, peptide, mucosal delivery, adjuvant, lipid core peptide system.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184964</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Services provided by community pharmacies in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Kay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1115 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Drugstores -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Pharmacy management -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Widening horizons: The YWCA in Queensland 1888-1988</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Aline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Women -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social dynamics of lifecourse timing in historical perspective : transitions in an Australian rural community, Boonah, 1850-1978</field><field name="creator">Cole, John R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boonah (Qld.) -- Social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Christian Brothers in secondary education in Queensland, 1875-1965.</field><field name="creator">Connole, P.

Thirty-seven Chinese native speakers of Mandarin and 35 Australian native speakers of English provided the baseline data. Thirty-five Chinese EFL learners at low proficiency level and 38 Chinese EFL learners at high proficiency level provided the target data. Altogether 580 emails were collected. Data was classified according to an adapted version of the coding scheme developed by Blum-Kulka et al. (1989). Email requests were analyzed at both the utterance and discourse levels. At the utterance level, directness level, strategy types and internal modifiers were examined. At the discourse level, external modifiers, including all the supportive moves in the opening, body, and closing of an email request were analyzed. Following Beebe et al. (1990), data was looked at in terms of the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were adopted. To determine evidence of pragmatic transfer, first, the Chinese baseline data and the English baseline data were compared. The EFL data was then compared with that of the two baseline groups. Pragmatic transfer was confirmed if the EFL data resembled the Chinese baseline data but differed from the English baseline data. In addition, the instances of pragmatic transfer displayed by the EFL groups at low and high proficiency levels were compared to examine the correlation between pragmatic transfer and language proficiency, that is, whether pragmatic transfer increases or decreases as learners&#8217; language proficiency increases. Pragmatic transfer was investigated on both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic levels. Findings of the present study show that pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic transfer occurred at the utterance and the discourse levels in all three areas: the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features, by both the low and high proficiency EFL learners. Moreover, a comparison of the performance of requests by the two learner groups indicates that the high proficiency learners had a greater amount of pragmatic transfer than the low proficiency learners. The findings of this study lend strong support to the positive correlation hypothesis proposed by T. Takahashi and Beebe (1987). The findings of the present study highlight the importance of the inclusion of pragmatic components in foreign language teaching. Pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed. Possible suggestions regarding how to improve the EFL learners&#8217; pragmatic competence are provided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">pragmalinguistic transfer</field><field name="subject">sociopragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">request</field><field name="subject">directness</field><field name="subject">indirectness</field><field name="subject">politeness</field><field name="subject">pragmatic failure</field><field name="subject">pragmatic competence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evan Mackenzie : pioneer merchant pastoralist of Moreton Bay / John H.G.

Consequently, the global alumina industry is perpetually striving to meet demands in conjunction with research, development and implementation of more efficient and sustainable processes and practises. Of specific concern for many proponents within the industry is that increased alumina production inadvertently results in increased Bayer Process-derived alkaline solid and liquid waste loads. Furthermore, in-house power generation at all Australian alumina refineries contributes to acid gas emissions, particularly SOx and NOx, both of which have environmental and anthropogenic impacts of global concern. The focus of this work is SO2 emission. SOx emission control measures can be achieved before, during or after combustion; the latter is termed flue gas desulphurisation (FGD). Commercially available FGD systems are dominated by once-through wet processes whereby the flue gas passes up through an absorbtion tower. The most favourable medium for industrial use is seawater, followed by limestone, and in some cases, a combination of both. However, the ever-increasing stringency of environmental emission legislation continues to inflict tighter controls on power production and is forcing industry to investigate alternative cost-effective FGD mediums. Therefore much research is currently dedicated to the utilisation of high volume, alkaline waste streams over manufactured sorbents. Modern environmental engineering approaches to waste product minimisation, neutralisation and/or reuse have lead to many new processes which change the view of many materials from waste product to environmental resource. Subsequently, this work examines the application of an isolated Bayer Process waste product, tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate (TCA6), as a FGD medium. Initial research assessed the dissolution behaviour and performance of the proposed medium with sulphuric acid, followed by batch reactor trials with a simulated flue gas. Data derived from this research indicated the suitability of TCA6 as a FGD medium and was subsequently applied to a preliminary model and proposed design parameters required for further pilot scale investigations. This work provides strong support for an economically viable and more sustainable approach to FGD for the alumina industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayer Process</field><field name="subject">calcination</field><field name="subject">reduction</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate</field><field name="subject">flue gas desulphurisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE FUNCTION AND ACTIVITY: (BIODYNAMIC ANALYSIS)</field><field name="creator">William Mccullagh</field><field name="description">Abstract There is a need in medicine and research for noninvasive, painless, safe and simple bed-side techniques to measure physiological processes associated with muscle function and activity. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a widely used, noninvasive, painless, safe and simple procedure for the measurement of body composition. However, although capable of producing accurate and reproducible data, it is known to be prone to movement artifacts. This poses the interesting question &#8220;Could impedance changes be used to monitor movement and, consequently, be related to muscle function or activity?&#8221; This project investigated the utility of impedance change as a monitoring technique for physiological processes that involve movement such as muscular contraction, the calf muscle pump, and swallowing. The impedance of leg muscle segments during locomotion, whilst riding a stationary exercise cycle, was measured at discrete frequencies and by bioimpedance spectroscopy to monitor muscle function or activity. Impedance traces were compared to information obtained by electromyography (EMG). Impedance, at a discrete frequency, was able to measure the cadence of cycling and its magnitude was related to the position of the pedal during the pedal cycle. When the cycling action was measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy, R0 and Zc showed a statistically significant difference, (p&lt;0.05), between all angles of the pedal crank cycle while R&#8734; showed a statistically significant difference between angles in the lower hemisphere of the pedal crank cycle. The cyclical changes in impedance during cycling may be attributed to changes in shape and volume of the muscle during contraction as well as a volume change due to blood and lymph being pumped from the limb by the action of the calf muscle pump. Based on procedures used in the cycling studies, an impedance-based method for the measurement of calf muscle pump function during an exercise protocol, originally designed for use with air plethysmography, was developed. It was shown that impedance measured at 5 kHz provides a simple, non-invasive method for the measurement of the ejection fraction and ejection volume of the calf muscle pump as well as other haemodynamic variables. The impedance-based method was less technically challenging than accepted volumetric methods, such as air plethysmography and strain gauge plethysmography, and non-invasive c.f. ambulatory venous pressure, enabling it to be used repeatedly. Muscle function and activity is not confined to the legs so impedance changes in the arm and forearm during exercise were measured. Impedance measurements, at discrete frequencies and using bioimpedance spectroscopy, of the forearm during contractions of the hand were able to distinguish the difference between a ramp and a pulse contraction. When the impedance of the arm and forearm were plotted against the angle of the forearm to the horizontal during a bicep curl, there was an hysteresis effect. Impedance traces of a bicep curl were compared to an EMG trace of the same action. The larynx is a hollow muscular organ situated in the front of the neck above the trachea consisting of a framework of cartilages bound together by muscles and ligaments. The two major functions of the larynx are deglutition and phonation. Dysphagia, which is becoming more prevalent as the population ages, is defined as difficulty in swallowing thin liquids such as water or juices which splash into the trachea because the patient is unable to control the thin liquid bolus. Aspiration pneumonia and dehydration can be prevented by using thickened liquids which allow patients to achieve a safer swallowing response, but it is difficult to assess this response without interfering with the swallowing process. Impedance pharynography (IPG) is a technique using BIA to monitor an impedance waveform of the swallowing process that presents no radiation hazard to the patient, is non-invasive and does not require specialist trained personnel to operate it. Resistance changes across the neck were measured while subjects swallowed solutions of different viscosities. The resistance changes were distinctive and reproducible for each of the solutions of different viscosities which were swallowed. Measuring the function of the larynx by this method could be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia. In conclusion, the studies described in this thesis demonstrate the potential usefulness of the measurement of change in impedance as a measure of muscle activity. Impedance-based methods can measure volume changes associated with changes in cross-sectional area of the muscles involved in contraction as well as compartmental fluid changes caused by the force of the contraction on the surrounding tissues including the vasculature. In particular, measuring the ejection fraction and other haemodynamic variables of the calf muscle pump by impedance has the potential to become the method of choice in the future because it is easy to use, inexpensive, non-invasive, safe, and hygenic. Measuring resistance changes across the neck during swallowing yields distinctive waveforms with features corresponding to the physiological phases of the swallowing process as well as identifying distinctive swallowing patterns associated with the different viscosities of liquids swallowed. Function of the larynx and the associated diseases of the larynx will potentially be easier to diagnose and treat with a safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, portable bed-side method of assessment such as BIA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">impedance, calf muscle pump, dysphonia, dysphagia, bioelectrical impedance analysis, hysteresis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mary MacKillop: A biographical study of Australian sainthood</field><field name="creator">Steer, Judith M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2204 Religion and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">MacKillop, Mary, 1842-1909</field><field name="subject">Sisters of St. Joseph (Australia) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Redundancy, authority and workplace relations : case studies of retrenchments in south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Grindrod, Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1503 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">Layoff systems.</field><field name="subject">Layoff systems -- Queensland -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Personnel management -- Queensland -- Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Unemployment -- Queensland -- Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Database design, archaeological classification and geographic information systems: A case study from southeast Queensland</field><field name="creator">Smith, James Reginald</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2101 Archaeology</field><field name="subject">0406 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience</field><field name="subject">750901 Understanding Australia's past</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems.</field><field name="subject">Archaeological dating.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Site/counter-site: A semiotic study of the Gold Coast</field><field name="creator">Barcan, Ruth Margaret</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">Popular culture -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Signs and symbols -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Gold Coast (Qld.)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adam's ribs: Gender, colonialism, and the missionaries, 1800-1860</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Anna</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210399 Historical Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">London Missionary Society</field><field name="subject">Missionaries -- India</field><field name="subject">Missionaries -- Polynesia</field><field name="subject">Missionaries -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185182</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of middle school science textbooks recommended for use with a constructivist syllabus in Queensland schools.</field><field name="creator">Christine Milne</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an analysis of science textbooks, eight years after the implementation of the Years 1-10 Queensland Science Syllabus, which suggested a move towards constructivist teaching in Queensland schools (QSSC 1999). The textbooks have been analysed for evidence of constructivism, and this has led to recommendations for writing better textbooks. This thesis has been written in five chapters. In Chapter 1, a review of literature develops a conceptual framework, which is the basis of this research. Chapter 2 describes the process used to develop its methodology, and Chapter 3 presents the results of this analysis. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the findings of this research and its implications for textbook content and design. In the literature review the themes of constructivism and the nature of science and the use of textbooks by teachers are explored. It suggests that textbooks continue to be central to developing curriculum, that they are used as a reference and as an independent learning tool, rather than as a guide to enacting curriculum. It also shows constructivist teaching closely aligns with authentic science, that it moves school science closer to that practised by scientists, and that it can engender improvements in teaching practice and in student interest. The data from this research has been collected using an analytical grid developed from three successive trials, after the literature review showed no previously developed analytical grid was suitable. In this final version of the grid, Likert scales are used to observe four dimensions of constructivism in textbook activities: coherence (use knowledge and concepts in a range of contexts), student-centredness of inquiries, language used and analysis questions to practice making new knowledge claims. The unit of analysis was ecology chapters of four middle school science textbooks. The research questions asked in this study are as follows: &#8226; Is a constructivist approach discernable in the textbooks reviewed in terms of the four dimensions of constructivism identified in the literature review? &#8226; What elements of constructivism are readily identifiable, and therefore are easily included in textbooks? &#8226; What elements of constructivism are not discernable? The results of this research have been synthesised and show no textbook could be considered constructivist, although one textbook had inquiries that could be considered exemplary. Two of the textbooks had no claim to be constructivist because they lacked inquiries, and this is where students experience the methods of scientists and practise making knowledge claims. &#8195; Other conclusions of this research include the following: &#8226;All textbooks reviewed were deficient in at least one dimension of constructivism, and those with one inquiry cannot be constructivist; &#8226;Activities and contexts made textbooks more coherent; &#8226;Technical terms were reduced compared to what has been traditionally covered by textbooks, however technical terms are also essential to scientific literacy and need to be used appropriately; &#8226;Most methods of inquiries are prescribed, so they do not allow students to solve problems in their own relevant contexts; even in those textbooks with more inquiries; &#8226;There was little evidence of hypothetico-deductive reasoning in inquiries rather data collection and simple analysis were usually suggested. Guidelines for writing better textbooks have become apparent from this research. Coherent textbooks are inherently constructivist because they apply concepts across contexts, and have more inquiries. Inquiries with a rigorous, authentic hypothetico-deductive approach arise naturally when the methods, concepts and language of science are applied in contexts that students are likely to find relevant and interesting, and where real-life problems need to be solved. Adopting these recommendations could lead to textbooks being more centrally positioned in enacting curriculum than now, because they are more likely to be constructivist (and represent the best thinking in the field).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructivism, science textbooks, middle school, ecology, philosophy of science, language, inquiries</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pennies from heaven: The Queensland Government Mining Journal, 1900-1929</field><field name="creator">Murray, Alan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">650402 Mining and extraction</field><field name="subject">671502 Mining machinery and equipment</field><field name="subject">Queensland government mining journal</field><field name="subject">Mines and mineral resources -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Mines and mineral resources -- Queensland -- Government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Houses for Queenslanders of small means?: Workers' dwellings in old Coorparoo Shire, 1910-40</field><field name="creator">Rechner, Judy</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Domestic -- Queensland -- Coorparoo.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living on the edge: Along Tingalpa Creek.

The purpose is twofold: to provide a critical history of the first book-length English translations of individual poets, published over roughly a ten-year period; and to identify and examine, among those publications, works that took a distinctive and challenging translation approach. The main argument is that the chief works examined in this study each present a differing approach that challenges the dominant postwar discourse on translation in the Japanese literary studies community. The study fills a conspicuous gap in translation studies, since it is the first in-depth examination of modern Japanese poetry in translation. It focuses on two translation approaches, specifically &#8220;interpretive&#8221; and &#8220;source-oriented&#8221; translation, which have tended to be loosely associated with the vague notions of &#8220;free&#8221; translation and &#8220;literal&#8221; translation respectively. The importance of the study stems from its clarified definitions of these approaches through analyses of published translations featuring their rigorous use. It also suggests arguments for and implications of using and identifying these approaches, both for the translator and for translation scholars. Modern poetry was chosen as a genre because it features the two approaches prominently and because it was felt important to focus on a genre somewhat marginalised among publications of Japanese literature in translation. The study focuses in particular on translations published in the period 1968-1978, because this represented a flowering period of publications of modern Japanese poetry, including the first book-length publications of individual poets. Chapter One has two parts: definitions and contexts. The definitions section is a brief discussion of translation theory focusing on views that have gone beyond the &#8220;literal&#8221; versus &#8220;free&#8221; argument, and it examines a number of significant statements in the field of translations studies in order to develop useful definitions of key terms used throughout the study. The second half contextualises the significance of the chosen publications in the Japanese literary studies community. This includes a brief history of translation and translation theory focusing on the views of the dominant translators in the early postwar years, including discussions, disagreements or criticisms concerning the &#8220;right&#8221; way to translate. It also includes an analysis of attitudes towards modern poetry among scholars and translators of Japanese literature and a brief discussion of translations of modern Japanese poetry. Chapter Two examines poet Gary Snyder&#8217;s interpretive and transformative translations of Miyazawa Kenji&#8217;s (1896-1933) poems &#8220;Haru to shura&#8221; (Spring and Asura) and &#8220;Nusubito&#8221; (The Thief). The chapter shows how Snyder&#8217;s renditions of these poems can be related to the structure and themes of his own poetry collection The Back Country (1968) in which the translations appeared. By throwing his interpretive reading of these poems into the translations, as well as making some creative adjustments, Snyder allows the translations to fit within the thematic movement of his own collection. This chapter also argues that the act of identifying interpretive approaches in the case of poet-translators can be an an important tool in establishing links between the translations and the poet&#8217;s original literary works, and even further links with the poet&#8217;s life and philosophy. Chapter Three examines Hiroaki Sato&#8217;s translations of Hagiwara Sakutar&#333; (1886-1942) in Howling at the Moon (1978). Sato takes an estranging, source-oriented approach similar to Lawrence Venuti&#8217;s concept of &#8220;foreignisation&#8221;, an approach that signals the difference of the source text and culture by departing from accepted language usage. With Sato&#8217;s translations we can observe the estranging effect of the source-oriented approach working in two directions: suggesting the difference of source text syntax from the target language perspective; and giving an equivalent effect of some unusual language use that was already estranging for source language readers. Sato sees the estranging function of Sakutar&#333;&#8217;s syntax as an essential element of his poetry, and has developed his whole translation strategy around this view. Chapter Four discusses Cid Corman and Kamaike Susumu&#8217;s translations of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems in frogs &amp;. others. (1969). As with Sato&#8217;s versions of Sakutar&#333;, Corman and Kamaike take a source-oriented approach, and their clever use of text selection and ordering as translation strategies has enabled them to convey their interpretation of Kusano Shinpei&#8217;s frog poems as directing a defamiliarising gaze back at humans and human society. Rather than aiming for complete linguistic accuracy as Sato does, they focus on a mirror-image source-oriented approach&#8212;often reproducing the source text&#8217;s word order and line order&#8212;not only as a means to suggest Kusano&#8217;s syntax, but also as a form of language experimentation and wordplay that enables their translations to stand out as autonomous poetic texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese</field><field name="subject">poetry</field><field name="subject">modern</field><field name="subject">free verse</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">Miyazawa Kenji</field><field name="subject">Hagiwara Sakutar&#333;</field><field name="subject">Kusano Shinpei</field><field name="subject">Literature in Japanese</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An account of the beginnings of settlement at Nundah : And the development of that suburb until 1890</field><field name="creator">Roberts, E.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nundah (Qld.) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The late effects of poliomyelitis in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Mary Rose</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poliomyelitis -- Complications.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of Ipswich in early Queensland</field><field name="creator">Davis, Bruce Lawrence</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ipswich (Qld.) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration and masculinities: Experiences of recent Chinese male migrants in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Hibbins, Raymond Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">200208 Migrant Cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">940111 Ethnicity, Multiculturalism and Migrant Development and Welfare</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Brisbane</field><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating a large scale collaborative venture (LSCV) project: An approach to economic growth based on a strategic marketing evaluation of the Multifunction Polis Project (1987 - 1990)</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Maxwell James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Multifunction polis.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land use survey: Mount Tamborine and Beechmont, S.E.

The primary focus of the study is the progress of the first generation of settlement, 1861-1880. Presented in generally chronological form, the experimental successes and failures of the first white inhabitants of Australia's first enduring tropical settlement are examined. The emphasis is social, but issues of regional frontier economics, immigration from Europe and other Australian colonies, patterns of settlement in the district, political development featuring the first North Queensland separation movement, race relations during initial contact between the whites and Aborigines and sea and overland communications are integral components. For administrative purposes, the Queensland Government sub-divided the Kennedy into two regions, north and south, and it was the south Kennedy with which*Bowen most interacted. Bowen was the first of several coastal frontier towns in the North Queensland area. Its early ambition was to become the capital of a new North Queensland colony, but rivalries for prominence in the region soon arose. Eventually, the centre of Townsville, to Bowen's north, overshadowed the first settlement, and by 1880, the future of Bowen as a permanent but secondary port was determined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bowen (Qld.) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dumping ground : Barambah Aboriginal settlement 1900-40</field><field name="creator">Blake, Thom W.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210301 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander History</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Reservations.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="subject">Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve (Qld.)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'birth of the prison' and the death of convictism : the operation of the law in pre-separation Queensland 1839 to 1859</field><field name="creator">Connors, Libby</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">940403 Criminal Justice</field><field name="subject">180110 Criminal Law and Procedure</field><field name="subject">Criminal justice, Administration of -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taint</field><field name="creator">Cheryl Jorgensen</field><field name="description">Abstracts THE TAINT This is a memoir of Ray &#8220;Poss&#8221; Ide, a man who has carried the taint of a horrifying crime since he was seventeen years old&#9472;a crime he claims he did not commit. The crime was the rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. The Taint looks at the time leading up to his conviction for rape, including the years he spent in Westbrook Boys&#8217; Reformatory and Boggo Road Gaol as a minor, and then his sentence served in NSW gaols with such inmates as Stephen Bradley, the man who kidnapped and murdered Graham Thorne, and the bizarre but rather likeable Dave Scanlan, known for his exploits as &#8220;the Kingsgrove Slasher&#8221;. In prison, Scanlan encouraged him to become an elite sportsman and released, Poss was recruited by Canterbury Eels football team; but just on the point of making a name for himself in Sydney, someone discovered that he had been gaoled for rape, and humiliated, he left the team. He moved back home to Queensland via Grafton, NSW (where he met and later married the Jacaranda Queen) and continued his sporting career, but never again in the Big League. He became the Manager of the Waterside Workers&#8217; Club and helped prevent a turf war between the Wharfies and members of the Painters and Dockers. Poss is now working with lawyer Robert Bax to have his case re-opened. He believes his story to be a cautionary tale for young men. It is a chronicle of social change, including the sexual revolution of the sixties, the confrontations with &#8220;the demons&#8221; in the streets of Brisbane during the Joh era of Bible-bashing fundamentalism and police corruption. It&#8217;s a story about what really went on behind closed doors in institutions where vulnerable children were preyed upon, in gaols where men were expected to become beasts. It is a story of how the taint of a terrible crime affected a man&#8217;s whole life. &#8220;QUESTIONS OF OWNERSHIP&#8221; Writing someone else&#8217;s story can be an ethical minefield&#9472;especially regarding questions of ownership. Who owns the story, the subject or the author? The easy answer to this is the subject owns the story and the author the text, but on closer examination this may not necessarily be so. Then there are those other stakeholders who claim ownership of story: people who embrace a narrative because of its similarity to their own lives. Published stories about institutional abuse have resonated for adults who as children were placed into the care of churches or the state. Another kind of ownership is claimed by readers who accept a version of a story and dismiss any counter-story as being invalid. What I call the &#8220;Plath Phenomenon&#8221; is an example of this. I will examine these kinds of ownership of story with particular reference to the work of Janet Malcolm on biography and then will look at gaps and silences in &#8220;official&#8221; stories, those created in police stations and courtrooms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">police corruption, injustice, Bjelke-Petersen, unions, verballing, court transcripts, sportsmanship, prison life, Westbrook, tainted evidence.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faith in the Sunshine State: Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the religious culture of Queensland</field><field name="creator">Harrison, John (John Murray)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220405 Religion and Society</field><field name="subject">Bjelke-Petersen, Johannes, Sir, 1911-2005 -- Religion.</field><field name="subject">Christianity -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Church and state -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arnold Wienholt, man and myth: A biography</field><field name="creator">Siemon, Rosamond</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Wienholt, Arnold, 1877-1940</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queensland Baptists: The development of Baptist evangelicalism, 1846-1926</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Patrick John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220401 Christian Studies (incl.

Julius Caesar: Motives, Methods, Successes and the Question of Tyranny.</field><field name="creator">Mark Avery</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the motives, methods and successes of opposition to C. Julius Caesar in the period 60-50 leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49. An attempt has been made to distinguish between traditional and innovative methods of opposition. An evaluation of creativity levels and the social acceptability of actions has been conducted in an effort to understand adherence to moral standards in the pre-war period. In Chapter 2, opposition to Caesar in 60 and 59 is examined and found to be fierce, persistent and, despite Caesar ultimately achieving his aims, successful in a limited way. Chapter 3 examines the circumstances of 58-57. Caesar&#8217;s position was more firmly secured through the agency of Clodius&#8217; tribunate, during which Cicero was exiled and Cato was removed from the political scene for both political and personal reasons. Examination of opposition to Caesar in Chapter 4 focuses on the period 56-54. It is demonstrated that prior to the conferences of Luca and Ravenna, opposition to Caesar was broadly undertaken by groups or individuals who fomented dissent between Crassus and Pompey in order to undermine the triumvirate as a whole. In 55 opposition to Caesar was nullified by a renewal of the triumvirate. In 54 opposition was resurgent and dominated the courts with limited success. In Chapter 5, opposition to Caesar in the period 53-50 is examined and is shown to be marked by anarchy, attempted reforms and the disintegration of the triumviral alliance. Given widespread impressions of pressure, corruption, violence and breakdown, especially in modern accounts of the period, it is suprising to discover that tactics used by Caesar&#8217;s opponents were traditional and socially acceptable for the most part, despite vehement political and personal disagreement. The will of the people was still respected by Caesar&#8217;s opponents; popular opinion in 59 was in fact the cause of opposition failure. While the Republic had suffered civil war in the opening decades of the first century BC, the state had resumed constitutional operation prior to 60. Traditional moral values and methods of gaining rank and prestige were still important and continued to be adhered to after 60. Methods of influence and social communication remained largely unchanged in the 50s, and ensured the continuity of political exchange without substantial innovation. From 56 to 54 opposition methods were opportunistic, a result of the renewal of the triumvirate. Caesar&#8217;s opponents continued to adhere to traditional political practice, despite dominance of the political machinary by the triumvirate. In 54 Caesar&#8217;s opponents gained control of the law courts, which resulted in numerous trials but no break with traditional or socially acceptable behaviour. Opposition between 53 and 50 remained traditional in most cases within an environment marked by anarchy and political stalemate, fueled by the intransigence of Caesar and Pompey who refused to recognise each others&#8217; dignitas. The Civil War, then, was not caused by an extended period of constitutional instability. The Civil War was the result of political deadlock at the end of the 50s, motivated by the social and political inflexibility of a small group of Senators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">caesar, roman republic, politics, roman law, voting assemblies, roman senate, pompey, cicero, cato minor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of life and social exchange of public nursing home residents in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Zlobicki, Malgosia Teresa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">111001 Aged Care Nursing</field><field name="subject">111702 Aged Health Care</field><field name="subject">Nursing homes -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Quality of life.</field><field name="subject">Nursing home patients -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Queensland Police Force 1895-1910</field><field name="creator">Kowald, Margaret</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Queensland.

This critical commentary sets De la sonorit&#233; in both aesthetic and historical contexts, examining the ways in which Moyse made use of the human voice, and more specifically bel canto, as a model for flute players and instrumentalists in general. It is clear that Moyse&#8217;s own experience in opera orchestras and exposure to opera repertoire and singers influenced his teaching style and publications. In addition to De la sonorit&#233;, he published two volumes of opera arias transcribed for the flute (in 1962 and 1973) which suggest that bel canto, the opera and the flute were all related in his mind. Indeed, it is possible to significantly enhance our understanding of De la sonorit&#233; if it is viewed from the perspective of its vocal influences. Historical references advocate the use of the voice as a model for expression because it is the vehicle through which emotions are expressed. As a result Moyse extolled this &#8220;natural way&#8221; in his teachings. Exploring bel canto establishes similarities to flute playing both aesthetically and technically. The exercises contained in De la sonorit&#233; enable the player to work towards producing a homogeneous and focused sound with ease through the entire register of the instrument at any dynamic level. Alongside a discussion of the five sections that make up De la sonorit&#233; (&#8220;Timbre and Homogeneity of Tone in the Three Registers,&#8221; &#8220;Suppleness in the Low Register,&#8221; &#8220;Attack and Slurring of Notes,&#8221; &#8220;Fullness of Tone&#8221; and &#8220;The Management of Tone in Interpretation&#8221;) the present study includes a practical performance-based perspective with commentary on Moyse&#8217;s approach from three leading flute players and pedagogues currently working in Australia: James Kortum, Lecturer in Flute at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music; Alan Hardy, Lecturer in Flute at The University of Melbourne; and Prudence Davis, Principal Flute with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Marcel Moyse, French Flute School, Opera, Bel Canto, Flute methods</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Battling the knowledge factor: A study of farmers' use of the internet to support information seeking, learning and knowledge processes in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Starasts, Ann Maree Taylor</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agriculture -- Computer network resources.</field><field name="subject">Internet -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Agricultural information networks -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Information storage and retrieval systems -- Agriculture -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186936</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Penalties and Sentences Act 1992 (Qld): A critical analysis of its principles and underlying rationales</field><field name="creator">Kilner, Ronald G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160203 Courts and Sentencing</field><field name="subject">Queensland Penalties and Sentences Act, 1992.</field><field name="subject">Sentences (Criminal procedure) -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A praise that never ages": The Australian War Memorial and the "national" interpretation of the First World War, 1922-35</field><field name="creator">Melrose, Craig</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian War Memorial -- History.</field><field name="subject">World War, 1914-1918 -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative policy study of incarcerated mothers and their young children in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and England</field><field name="creator">Farrell, Margaret Ann</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160202 Correctional Theory, Offender Treatment and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">160603 Comparative Government and Politics</field><field name="subject">Women prisoners -- Family relationships -- Government policy</field><field name="subject">Children of prisoners -- Government policy</field><field name="subject">Women prisoners -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Women prisoners -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Women prisoners -- Victoria</field><field name="subject">Women prisoners -- New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Children of prisoners -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Children of prisoners -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Children of prisoners -- Victoria</field><field name="subject">Children of prisoners -- New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cancers of the Oesophagus: Exploring the Roles of Smoking, Alcohol and Gastro-oesophageal Reflux</field><field name="creator">Nirmala Pandeya</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Background Oesophageal cancer has a high mortality; it is the 6th most common cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Of the common subtypes of oesophageal cancer, it is the adenocarcinomas that have been rising rapidly in incidence throughout the western world. The incidence of adenocarcinomas now exceeds the previously common squamous cell carcinoma. These recent changes in the incidence patterns of oesophageal cancer suggests that the environmental risk factors associated with these subtypes differ, and that changes in the prevalence of these exposures over time are the most likely explanation for the observed shifts in the incidence. However, due to its low incidence until a few decades ago, the adenocarcinoma subtype has been less studied compared to squamous cell carcinoma, and the environmental factors associated with this cancer have not been so clearly defined. Smoking and alcohol have been the strongest environmental risk factors reported for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whereas for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), the effect of smoking appears to be weaker, and the evidence for an effect of alcohol is scant and inconsistent. However, epidemiologic studies consistently identify people with frequent symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) as having the highest risk of OAC, but the effect of GOR on OSCC has been negligible. Furthermore, it has been argued that adenocarcinoma occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJAC) may have different aetiology again. Together, these reports suggest the three subtypes of oesophageal cancers (OAC, GOJAC and OSCC) may arise through different mechanisms with different strengths in the impact of risk factors. This thesis investigated the independent associations of smoking, alcohol and gastro-oesophageal reflux on cancers of the oesophagus by considering the possibility of variation in the risks due to differences in the dose effect patterns of various measures such as smoking, alcohol and GOR. Method Data from a population-based case-control study of oesophageal and ovarian cancers in Australia were used. Study participants comprised histologically confirmed cases of OSCC (n=308), OAC (n=367) and GOJAC (n=426) who were frequency matched to 1580 controls from the general population. Exposure history for both cases and controls were derived from health and lifestyle questionnaires. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the risk factors analysed. In addition, generalised additive model with a logit link was also used to explore and present the non-linearity in the dose effect pattern for continuous exposures adjusting for other confounding factors. The effects of two exposures combined on these cancers were assessed by obtaining synergy index. Results Smokers were at significantly higher risk of all three subtypes of oesophageal cancer with the risk greatest for OSCC. The effect of smoking was greater for adenocarcinoma occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction compared to that of the oesophagus. Of the various measures of smoking, duration was significantly associated with all three subtypes of cancer whereas intensity was associated with only OSCC and GOJAC and the dose effect was non-linear. Time since quitting was associated with a steady decline in risk of all three cancers emphasising the health benefits of quitting among smokers. Alcohol was not associated with OAC or GOJAC but was significantly associated with OSCC among those drinking in excess of 170g/week. The association between alcohol and OSCC was modified by smoking; the association with alcohol was significantly greater among current smokers with effect. Low to moderate wine consumption was associated with significant risk reduction for all three cancers compared to non-drinkers. Increased frequency of GOR symptoms was associated with increased risks of OAC and GOJAC, although the risk of OSCC was constrained to frequent GOR symptoms only. The effect of GOR symptoms were exacerbated by smoking whereas it was weakened by regular NSAID use. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis that assessed the effect of non-participation among controls in the estimated effect of smoking and BMI (the two risk factors most likely to be affected by non-participation) showed a slight overestimation of effect of smoking assuming higher exposure rate among non-participants but not BMI while the effect remained strong and statistically significant. Conclusion Smoking, alcohol and GOR symptoms were the environmental factors strongly associated with all subtypes of oesophageal cancers. However, the dose effect patterns of these exposures varied by cancer subtypes. Smoking and alcohol were the larger contributing factors for OSCC whereas smoking and GOR symptoms had greater impact on OAC and GOJAC. Low to moderate wine consumption and regular NSAID use reduced the risk of all three subtypes significantly. While selection bias may have led to mildly inflated risks for smoking, the effects persisted even when modelled under extreme scenarios of biased participation amongst controls, and there was no evidence that selection bias materially affected the other associations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oesophageal cancer, risk factors, smoking, alcohol, gastro-oesophageal reflux</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using wildlife tourism and post-visit support to enhance families&#8217; conservation learning at Mon Repos Conservation Park</field><field name="creator">Karen Hughes</field><field name="description">Abstract Nature-based tourism and wildlife tourism are becoming increasingly popular worldwide and are often promoted as a means of protecting and preserving environmental resources. These forms of tourism are usually accompanied by interpretation such as signs, presentations and activities specifically designed to raise visitors&#8223; awareness of, and concern for, environmental issues. The rationale behind this approach is that enhancing visitors&#8223; environmental knowledge, understanding and attitudes prompts the adoption of environmentally responsible behaviours. This is supported by a growing body of research that suggests that environmental interpretation has considerable potential to impact upon visitors&#8223; conservation knowledge and attitudes, and that well-designed interpretive experiences and messages are an effective means of reducing a range of negative &#8222;on-site&#8223; behaviours such as littering, straying from walkways and feeding wildlife. However, there has been little exploration of whether environmental interpretation influences the uptake of conservation practices &#8222;off-site&#8223; or how the positive impacts of nature-based tourism can be maintained over time. Until recently, tourism research exploring post-visit behaviour has used visitors&#8223; immediate post-visit intentions as a measure of behaviour change. There is increasing evidence, however, that stated intentions to engage in conservation behaviours rarely manifest as actual behaviour, and that visitors&#8223; on-site enthusiasm and commitment tends to wane following their visit. The current research aimed to investigate whether providing visitors with post-visit support in the form of learning materials and reminders would prevent this decline and enhance long-term conservation learning (hereby defined as knowledge, attitudes and behaviour). This research explores short and long-term changes in families&#8223; conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour following their visit to Mon Repos Conservation Park, a world renowned turtle rookery in Queensland, Australia. Stage one of the study involved surveying 100 Australian families to identify barriers and benefits associated with six conservation practices (re-using containers, buying minimal packaging, reducing use of plastic bags, picking up litter, recycling and composting). Using Community-based Social Marketing theory, responses informed the development of printed and online post-visit action resources specifically designed to reinforce the wildlife tourism experience and support families&#8223; conservation learning. Resources focused on the six conservation behaviours outlined above but also included other environmental activities and conservation information of relevance. v In stage two, two hundred Australian families visiting Mon Repos in December 2007 and January 2008 were sampled and assigned to either a treatment group (provided with post-visit action resources and regular contact) or the control group (no post-visit support). All families were asked to complete pre-visit, post-visit and follow-up questionnaires to enable the researcher to ascertain short-term and long-term changes in their conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and to identify factors contributing to the uptake of off-site conservation practices. The final sample comprised the one hundred families who completed all three questionnaires. Comparisons between responses of the control and treatment groups revealed that post-visit action resources reinforced respondents&#8223; knowledge of threats to turtles and enhanced their attitudes towards protecting wildlife and the natural environment. Families who received post-visit support were also significantly more likely to pick up litter and introduced more conservation actions than those who did not receive this support. Aspects of the post-visit action resources that were particular effective were updates of turtle activity at Mon Repos, emails, fact sheets and the newsletter. Other factors that prompted the adoption of conservation practices included Mon Repos&#8223; interpretation and the opportunity to view wildlife in its natural surroundings. The influence of other family members and pre-visit knowledge and interest were also found to be associated with subsequent uptake of conservation behaviours. Implications for wildlife interpretive practice and the design and delivery of post-visit support are discussed and recommendations for future research presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation learning</field><field name="subject">wildlife tourism</field><field name="subject">family learning</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="subject">Community-Based Social Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Johannes Bjelke-Petersen: A study in populist leadership</field><field name="creator">Wear, Rae</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160601 Australian Government and Politics</field><field name="subject">Bjelke-Petersen, Johannes, Sir, 1911-2005</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A good show: Colonial Queensland at international exhibitions</field><field name="creator">McKay, Judith</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2103 Historical Studies</field><field name="subject">Exhibitions -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Economic conditions -- 1824-1900 -- Exhibitions</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- History -- 1824-1900 -- Exhibitions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous knowledge and higher education: Instigating relational education in a neocolonial context</field><field name="creator">Sheehan, Norman</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1601 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">379902 Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Study and teaching (Higher)</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Education.</field><field name="subject">Ethnophilosophy -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Ethnoscience -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Applied anthropology -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making war real: the discourse of professional journalism and the Iraq War, 2003.</field><field name="creator">Giles Dodson</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT As this thesis argues, the pursuit of professionalism in journalism should be understood as a discourse that hegemonises the discursive formation of journalism and produces news that fulfils professional needs. Professionalism articulates and states its object, in this case war, rather than apprehending it through fidelity to normative criteria, such as the objective truth of &#8216;reality&#8217;. Conceiving of professional journalism as such provides a means of understanding and analysing media production outside of the theoretical bounds of &#8216;ideology critique&#8217;. Empirically, this thesis takes Australian war journalism during the invasion of Iraq, 2003, and professional journalistic discourse observed in interview with a selection of Australian Iraq war correspondents as its object of analysis. Previous analyses and critiques of journalism generally, and war journalism specifically, rely heavily on some conception of journalism as ideological. As this thesis argues this category of analysis is theoretically redundant and the discourse perspective provides a more fecund and insightful critique of journalism. The thesis provides a historical and critical account of professionalism&#8217;s emergence, eventual domination and hegemony of the journalistic field. It is argued that professionalism, as an articulation of social and cultural norms, retains its central cultural legitimacy in journalism, and is expressed through the journalistic norms of objectivity, independence and news values. It is argued that within the contemporary cultural conditions of postmodernism and neo-liberalism these modern norms are no-longer credible and useful in journalism. The empirical analysis of the professional discourse undertaken by the thesis demonstrates journalism as a pragmatic and contingent process of meaning creation, which legitimates and normalises its practices, forms and pre-occupations. In this sense the discourse, as a regime and process of meaning creation, produces its object, or makes war &#8216;real&#8217; for news audiences, rather than reflecting the independent reality of war. In the context of the Iraq invasion, 2003, the thesis reveals many limitations, contradictions and inconsistencies within journalistic norms and subjectivities. The thesis also demonstrates how the discursive needs of professional journalism tend to be coincident with the strategic communication intent of military and political power. This stands in marked contrast to journalism&#8217;s professed normative democratic function and to analyses of war journalism that consider this normative function irresistibly dominated by military and political power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism, war, professionalism, discourse, conflict, media, Iraq, Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Reverend Ernest Gribble and race relations in Northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Halse, Christine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Missions -- Australia, Northern.</field><field name="subject">Australia, Northern -- Race relations.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187892</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cultural history of Brisbane 1940-1970</field><field name="creator">Hatherell, William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature and society -- Queensland -- Brisbane -- History -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.) -- Intellectual life -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.) -- Social life and customs -- 20th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honour denied: A study of soldier settlement in Queensland, 1916-1929</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Murray David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="subject">Veterans -- Queensland -- Economic conditions.</field><field name="subject">Veterans -- Queensland -- Social conditions.</field><field name="subject">Veterans -- Employment -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Land settlement -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Agriculture -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Itinerant music teachers' work in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Roulston, Kathryn</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">130399 Specialist Studies in Education not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">Music teachers -- Employment -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict and conflict management in urban planning : the application of general theories to urban planning in the Queensland Local Government context</field><field name="creator">Minnery, J.

They are however, economically vital ecosystems in terms of both their income generating capacity and as a source of food for millions of people around the world. This predicament emphasises the need for effective ecosystem management to be able to balance the benefits of coral reefs with the inherent stressors associated with people utilising their resources. It is particularly important given the potential large scale impacts associated with climate change such as mass coral bleaching events. Similarly, much of the need for direct management of coral reefs exists in developing countries where the resources, information, and technology are limited or unavailable for such a task. This places them, in particular, at the high end of management uncertainty and impact vulnerability. Accordingly, there is a pronounced need to improve this capacity to understand coral reef ecosystem function and to use this to better predict the overall systems level outcome of management options. This thesis has sought to improve our understanding of key ecological elements of coral reef ecosystems and to build on this new knowledge to produce a widely applicable ecosystem model that will allow managers to better understand and predict the outcomes of their actions. Coral reef ecosystem behaviour is far from understood in its entirety and there are many facets that require detailed further investigations to be able to more confidently predict ecosystem response to any given disturbance. To enhance the current understanding of coral reef ecosystems prior to the model development, investigations were undertaken into the dynamics of nitrogen on a coral reef following bleaching induced coral mortality. The results showed that the rates of nitrogen fixation on surfaces made available due to a coral mortality event increased dramatically in the three months following coral mortality, potentially acting as a driving force for the ecosystem to pass through a phase shift to algal dominance. Application of these nitrogen dynamics to entire coral reef ecosystems required a methodology for scaling these sub coral colony processes to entire reefs. This scaling issue is particularly pertinent given the improved understanding of the overwhelming significance of micro-scale processes to community dynamics. The surface index (SI) concept, relating the two-dimensional projected area to the three-dimensional area of corals was refined and developed for variations of gross coral morphologies. This allowed for the scaling of nitrogen flux estimates to be made over entire reef systems, enabling the incorporation of these fluxes into an ecosystem scale model. One of the key factors associated with the potential for a coral reef to recover from a mass coral mortality event is the potential for new corals to successfully recruit. The process of coral recovery could potentially be enhanced if recruitment is viable in the immediate aftermath of a mortality event. Although investigations in this area were inconclusive, extensive herbivore action on turf assemblages up to eight months old indicated that recruitment may be inhibited through the high palatability of turf assemblages in this age bracket. Integrating these processes with the many other published dynamics of coral reefs allowed for the development of the dynamic systems model. By constraining the model structure to known relationships between the modelling parameters, the model can be calibrated to replicate the dynamics of any coral reef ecosystem. This allows the model to be applied to systems where limited data and/or resources are available, making it widely implementable in developing countries such as the small island states scattered around the tropics. The model is ideally suited to the adaptive management framework whereby managers can continually assess the potential future outcomes of management interventions. In addition, due to the spatially inexplicit and generic nature of the model, it can be easily adapted and integrated into large scale regional modelling frameworks or combined with other modelling packages such as socio-economic or fisheries models to provide enhanced management packages. The culmination of the targeted research and integration of existing knowledge has allowed for the development of an ecosystem model for coral reefs that can be easily adopted by coral reef managers throughout the world. It is however, by no means a definitive coral reef ecosystem model and there are many facets that can and should continue to be refined to enhance the reliability of the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coral reef</field><field name="subject">ecosystem response</field><field name="subject">ecosystem based management</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">surface area</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">ecological modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Tools for the Assessment of Social Competence in Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Catherine Hynes</field><field name="description">Background: Patients with non-penetrating traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are at high risk for damage to ventral prefrontal brain regions, due to the brain&#8217;s acceleration into the bony ridges of the anterior portions of the skull. Current neuropsychological assessments of these patients focus mainly on the assessment of so-called &#8220;executive functions,&#8221; which are associated with dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Ventral prefrontal pathology is more likely to disrupt social and emotional functions, but assessments of these abilities using objective measurements that require patients to demonstrate their competence are rare. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic social and emotional deficits are common in TBI, and that these difficulties result in significant functional impairments post-injury, making clear the need to develop and use objective assessment tools during clinical neuropsychological assessments. Methods: In the current project, the Global Interpersonal Skills Test (GIST), a questionnaire measure of social skills with both a self-rated and an informant-rated version, was developed, along with three novel or adapted performance-based measures of social and emotional functioning. The first novel measure was the Assessments of Social Context (ASC), a video-based task examining comprehension of social context using non-verbal cues, including the identification of emotions, intensions and positive or negative attitudes of one person towards another. The second task was the Awareness of Interoception Test (AIT), a heartbeat detection paradigm adapted from previous literature that measures participants&#8217; sensitivity to their cardiac function, which is implicated in basic emotional functioning. The third task was the Social Interpretations Task (SIT), an animation-based task adapted from previous literature examining participants&#8217; ability to apply a social interpretation to stimuli that are not inherently social in nature. All novel tasks were developed and piloted with healthy undergraduates. A group of patients with moderate to severe TBI (N = 16), and a group of non-brain damaged controls (N = 16) underwent neuropsychological testing. Standard neuropsychological measures including the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Digit Span and Digit Symbol Coding from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, phonemic (FAS) and semantic fluency (Animals) from the Verbal Fluency Test, and the Trail Making Test, as well as the novel measures to both patients with TBI and controls were administered. The following predictions were made: vi 1) The novel performance-based measures of social abilities would be more sensitive to the presence of moderate and severe TBI than the standard neuropsychological measures of cognition; 2) On the informant version of the GIST, but not the self-report version, patients would have scores than controls; 3) Patients&#8217; performance on the ASC would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this difference would be associated with real-world social skills, measured by the informant-version of the GIST; 4) Patients&#8217; AIT performance would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this would be related to their self-rated emotional changes; 5) Patients&#8217; SIT performance would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this difference would be associated with real-world social skills, again measured by the informant-version of the GIST. Findings: Findings were consistent with these hypotheses: 1) A statistically significant logistic regression revealed that a Social composite variable comprising the ASC, AIT and SIT was more sensitive to the presence of TBI (&#946; = 9.59, p &lt; .05) than a Cognitive composite variable comprising Digit Symbol Coding, Trails B completion time, and Phonemic Fluency (&#946; = 0.006, p = .466). 2) A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that informants of patients gave lower GIST scores to patients than the informants of controls (F(1,28) = 22.2, p &lt; 0.0001), whereas there were no differences between groups on the self-rated version of the GIST (F(1,28) = .35, p = .56); 3) Patients&#8217; ASC performance was significantly poorer than controls&#8217; on a MANOVA (F(1,31) = 21.7, p &lt; .0001), and ASC total scores were significantly correlated with GIST informant scores, using Spearman&#8217;s rank-order correlations (&#961;(31) = .624, p &lt; .0001). 4) Patients&#8217; AIT performance was significantly poorer than controls&#8217; using an independent samples t test (t(13) = 1.43, p &lt; 0.005), and qualitative investigation of subjective reports of emotional change among patients suggested a potential relationship between emotional changes and AIT performance. vii 5) Patients&#8217; SIT performance was significantly poorer than controls on an independent samples t test (t(30) = -2.12, p &lt; 0.05), and SIT scores were significantly correlated with GIST informant scores, using Spearman&#8217;s rank-order correlations (&#961;(31) = .460, p &lt; .0001). Interpretation: This research represents a preliminary step in the development of clinically useful measures of social and emotional difficulties following TBI. Given the small sample size of the patient group, and the presence of co-morbid difficulties among some of the participants in this research, further testing of these measures in larger, more homogeneous samples would strengthen the current results, as would using a comparison group of people with milder TBI, rather than neuro-typical controls. The complexity of social behaviour requires that the current measures be further validated against other real-world assessments of social ability, and that assessments of other aspects of social behaviour be conducted. Nonetheless, the measures described here are a promising start to supplementing the neuropsychological toolkit in an area that requires further development at the present time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">frontal lobe, traumatic brain injury, closed head injury, assessment, neuropsychology, social skills, emotions, executive function, social dysfunction non-verbal behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular Mechanisms of axon guidance and targeting in the olfactory system</field><field name="creator">Man-yee Chan</field><field name="description">Olfactory sensenory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium are located in the nasal cavity and project axons that synapse onto dendrites of second-order neurons within the olfactory bulb in neuropil structures termed glomeruli. Each OSN expresses one of the over 1000 odorant receptors (ORs) and are randomly dispersed across one of the four partially overlapping regions of the olfactory epithelium. OSNs expressing a single OR project their axons to typically two symmetrically bilateral glomeruli, one each on the medial and lateral surfaces of the olfactory bulb. The target choice of the OSN axons appears to depend on a combination of molecular determinants that first promote segregation of axons into broad regions of the olfactory bulb and then favor sorting and convergence into specific glomeruli. The role of ORs has clearly been demonstrated to play a significant role in axon sorting and targeting to the glomeruli, however other guidance molecules have clearly been shown to be required in the precise targeting of the OSN axons. During development of the mouse olfactory system, olfactory sensory axons first contact their terminal zone in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb during late embryonic period and target to their appropriate glomeruli over the next few days. During this period, many axons can branch inappropriately into several glomeruli and overshoot the target layer and enter deeper layers of the olfactory bulb. The aberrant axonal projections are normally detected within the deeper layers of the bulb up to postnatal day 12. By the end of the second postnatal week, axon trajectories are refined and axons over-projections are seldom observed in adult animals. A detailed understanding of the process of axon over-projections enabled the identification of directional cues that navigate the outgrowing axons to their defined destination. There are two aims of the present thesis, first, to investigate the role of cell surface carbohydrates in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying axon navigation in the developing olfactory system. To achieve this aim, transgenic mice expressing two glycosyltransferases (Mgat3 and 5) under the control of OMP promoter to drive expression in all mature OSNs have been generated. The results obtained from these transgenic mice showed that the transgene is expressed based on the ability to detect GFP reporter expression, however no apparent targeting defect in the olfactory pathway was observed from these transgenic mice. The purpose of the second study was twofold: 1) To examine the trajectory of olfactory sensory axons that penetrate past the glomerular layer in OMP-Zsgreen transgenic mice and 2) using in vitro cultures of the olfactory epithelium from OMP-Zsgreen mice which allowed visualization of mature OSN and their axons, together with extract prepared from inner layers of olfactory bulb to elucidate the impact of distinct molecular and cellular cues on defined OSN populations. Our results revealed that targeting of OSN axons was initially imprecise where extensive axons over-projection was observed in early postnatal animals. This targeting error was then refined later in development after the first two postnatal weeks and rarely observed in adult animals. The in vitro study using cultured OE explants to examine the effect of the extract prepared from the inner layers of the olfactory bulb on the axon outgrowth suggests the presence of a repellent activity in the inner layers of the olfactory bulb and that this inibition is stronger in P17.5 animals than P8.5 and P2.5 animals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The health of children attending special schools in the Gold Coast district, as perceived by their parents and teachers</field><field name="creator">Hogan, Margaret M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">130312 Special Education and Disability</field><field name="subject">1117 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="subject">Children -- Health and hygiene -- Queensland -- Gold Coast.</field><field name="subject">Special education -- Queensland -- Gold Coast.</field><field name="subject">Special schools</field><field name="subject">Health status</field><field name="subject">Child health questionnaire</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eugenic ideology and racial fitness in Queensland, 1900-1950</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Emily Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eugenics -- Queensland -- History -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land settlement in the northern districts of Port Curtis and Leichhardt, 1835-1869</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Lorna</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land settlement -- Queensland -- Port Curtis Region</field><field name="subject">Land settlement -- Queensland -- Leichhardt Region</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peat Deposits of Moreton Bay:Natural Archives of Environmental Pollution</field><field name="creator">Jiajia Zheng</field><field name="description">Two ombrotrophic peat bogs (NC2 and BL2) from North Stradbroke Island, Australia, were precisely dated using 210Pb and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Sub-samples were total digested and sequentially leached for trace and major elements concentrations using ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Total Pb concentrations in both profiles increased with the time. PAAS normalized REE patterns were characterized by relatively flat patterns, with slight enrichment in LREE, and a significant negative Eu anomaly. The temporal changes in metal concentrations, 206Pb/207Pb ratios, REEs, and ash content observed in the two profiles suggest three different periods with distinct conditions in terms of dust provenance and atmospheric pollution: (1) Pre-anthropogenic (pre-1842); (2) Early industrial (from 1840s to 1920s); (3) Industrial (post-1930s). Ombrotrophic peat bogs may be reliable archives of environmental pollution, but also shows that adjacent sites may provide contrasting evidence. Despite their close proximity, the two sites show different trends in metal deposition. Metals in NC appear to be largely bound to minerals and inorganic materials, while in BL they are mainly organic-related. Indeed the peculiar behaviour of Pb in the BL profile suggests that biological process may cause Pb isotopic fractionation. Ash contents, texture, Pb isotopic compositions, Sb/Pb values, patterns of selected trace elements (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Co, Sb, Ni, Se, As, Be and Mo), and their leaching behaviours suggests that NC and BL are chemically different types of peat bogs. NC peat bog is an open sink for elements, and can be used to define regional anthropogenic impacts. In contrast, the BL site appears to be influenced by local natural and anthropogenic processes and activities, such as changes in land use. Furthermore, it demonstrated that only some of the environmental-related trace elements preserve their original depositional record. Arsenic, Be, Co, and Zn are highly mobile under weak acid conditions, and are therefore not suitable for assessing temporal trends of pollution. Cadmium, Ni, and V may also be highly mobile under certain conditions. In contrast, Pb, Cu, Cr, Mo, and Sb are not subject to vertical migration, and are useful for establishing the pollution record of ombrotrophic peat bogs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">04 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Peat</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Pb</field><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">REE</field><field name="subject">European settlement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamentalism and conservative protestantism in Australia, 1920-1980</field><field name="creator">Parker, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fundamentalism</field><field name="subject">Protestant churches -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Church history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organising and representing women's interests: A case study of a nurses' union</field><field name="creator">Elder, Ruth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321100 Nursing</field><field name="subject">Women labor union members -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Queensland Nurses' Union of Employees</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict and controversy: The changing development pattern of the Noosa Shire 1910-1980</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Denise Terence</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750804 Regional planning</field><field name="subject">Regional planning -- Queensland -- Noosa (Shire) -- History</field><field name="subject">Noosa (Qld. : Shire) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jondaryan Station : the relationship between pastoral capital and pastoral labour, 1840-1890</field><field name="creator">Walker, Janette A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural laborers -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Rural conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catholicism in Queensland, 1910-1935 : a social history</field><field name="creator">MacGinley, M.

It is not an ecclesiastical history, nor a political or economic one, though considerations of prior concern for each such history impinge centrally on its subject matter. It will be argued that around both the years 1910 and 1935 new kinds of consciousness were emerging, both v/ithin the Church in Queensland and in its wider environment. This interval has been seen, therefore, as a unit permitting of a degree of discrete study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750401 Religion and society</field><field name="subject">Catholic church -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Catholics -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">John Dunmore Lang: With special reference to his activities in Queensland</field><field name="creator">McPheat, William Scott.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360101 Australian Government and Politics</field><field name="subject">Lang, John Dunmore, 1799-1878</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ticks and chemicals : with particular reference to pesticide resistance and its inheritance in Boophilus microplus</field><field name="creator">Stone, Bernard Felix</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">070205 Animal Protection (Pests and Pathogens)</field><field name="subject">0707 Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a continuous encapsulation method in a microfluidic device</field><field name="creator">Edeline Wong</field><field name="description">Delivery of a desired &#8216;active&#8217; compound (for example, starch (as an energy substrate)) to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is most easily achieved by oral administration. Unfortunately, the efficacy of most actives is greatly reduced due to the aggressive nature of digestive enzymes and processes which occur in this environment. A commonly applied strategy to prevent deactivation of the active prior to absorption at the target site is to encapsulate the active in another &#8216;sacrificial&#8217; or non-degradable polymer matrix. Traditionally, the active and matrix is processed into a microparticle format for easy oral delivery (dispersed in a liquid or paste). However, established encapsulation methods which rely on bulk-phase processing to produce these microparticles (e.g. emulsification) are far from ideal as they lack control over the final microparticle size, size distribution, composition and shape. The lack of control in the physical properties of the resultant microparticles in turn results in an inherent lack of control over the kinetics of release of the active at the target site. In contrast, recent advances in microfluidic device fabrication and methodology development have firmly proven that these new generation devices can produce monodisperse droplets and microparticles in a continuous, controllable and predictable manner. Their potential as a processing tool for the production of highly tailored microparticles for targeted delivery, however, remains to be fully explored. Both the physical and chemical (physicochemical) properties of microparticles made from a single polymer system may be altered by the deposition of one or more additional polymer layers onto the microparticle surface (for example, alternating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to produce core-shell like particles), and this method has proven to be favorable with regards to retarding the release of active compounds. However, this addition of alternate layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (so called Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition or assembly) does increase the number of processing steps the particles must undergo prior to storage or delivery. Further, the overall effectiveness of this additional processing is still highly dependent on the properties of the original (core) microparticles. In this thesis, a microfluidic technique was developed to encapsulate starch granules in alginate-based microparticles. Using this continuous technique, the size of the microparticles produced were shown to be monodisperse and reproducible. The developed microfluidic device included a drop formation section, followed by a gelation region and a transfer section, where the particles made on-chip are transferred from the carrier oil phase to an aqueous phase prior to collection. The microparticles collected from this microfluidic device were found to be stable for several weeks and in stark contrast to particles produced via a standard bulk emulsification routes, no aggregation was observed over this time frame. The release profile of glucose (as a result of starch hydrolysation) from microparticles produced using both a standard bulk emulsification method and the developed microfluidic-based method were compared. It was found that the monodisperse particles produced using the microfluidic method showed significantly more retardation to release compared to the glucose release profile from bulk-processed particles. This retardation effect was more pronounced when a thin layer of an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (chitosan) was adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface (alginate is an anionic polyelectrolyte) of the microfluidic-processed microparticle. The microfluidic device developed within this thesis and the resulting tailored microparticles thus show significant potential with regards to offering a new generation of microparticle delivery systems with highly deterministic delivery over extended lifetimes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="subject">microparticles</field><field name="subject">microfabrication</field><field name="subject">Alginate</field><field name="subject">Encapsulation</field><field name="subject">surface patterning</field><field name="subject">release study</field><field name="subject">Rheology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of developing a long-distance walking track in North Queensand</field><field name="creator">Cook, Averil</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1506 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Trails -- Economic aspects -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Economic aspects -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of normative pressures in Queensland state high schools</field><field name="creator">Murray, Louis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1701 Psychology</field><field name="subject">Child psychology</field><field name="subject">School management and organization -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Social psychology</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Organizational behavior</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A different outfit" : state trading enterprises in Queensland 1915-1930</field><field name="creator">Cohen, Kay</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Government business enterprises -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">John Moffat of Irvinebank : a biography of a regional entrepreneur</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Ruth S.

Broadly, the thesis challenges the way that industry policy on the left of politics (reflected in the social democratic and Keynesian positions) has been constructed as a practical, progressive policy agenda. Specifically, the thesis poses a direct challenge to the primacy of the &#8216;national&#8217; in interpreting the history of industry policy. The challenge is to the proposition that conflicts between national industry and international finance arose only from the mid 1980s. On the contrary, as will be seen, this is a 1960s issue and any interpretation of the debates and the agendas surrounding industry policy in the 1980s must be predicated on an understanding of how the issue was played out two decades earlier. As was the case in the 1960s, industry policy in the 1980s has been isolated from two key areas of interrogation: the role of the nation state in regulating accumulation and the role of finance in industry policy. In the 1950s and more so in the 1960s and early 1970s there was a reconfiguration of financing internationally but it is one that did not enter into industry policy analysis. The central concern therefore is to simultaneously sketch the historical political economy on industry policy from the 1950s through to the early 1970s in Australia and to analytically and empirically insert the role of finance into that history. In so doing the thesis addresses the economic and social factors that shaped the approach to industry finance in Australia during this critical period. The analysis is supported by a detailed examination of political and industry debates surrounding the proposal for, and institution of, a key national intervention in the form of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Industry policy, finance, global, nation state, AIDC, 1960s, Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ghost of caution haunts House of Dunn: The rise and fall of a Queensland newspaper dynasty (1930-1989)</field><field name="creator">Kirkpatrick, Rod</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dunn family</field><field name="subject">Provincial Newspapers (Qld.)

relative clauses</field><field name="creator">Ken-ichi Hashimoto</field><field name="description">Fluent sentence comprehension requires the automatic application of grammatical principles, in combination with other kinds of information, to a linear input string. The latter can vary greatly in complexity, and it has been observed that structures that involve non-adjacent relationships (non-local dependencies) cause particular processing difficulties, for even fluent readers. This thesis focuses on the potential role that L1 transfer plays in processing non-local dependencies in the L2. Although L1 transfer has been demonstrated in a variety of L2 domains (Juffs, 2005), the degree to which L1 syntactic properties influence the L2 in real-time processing remains an open question (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). A better understanding of L1 influence on L2 processing has important implications for emerging models of L2 sentence processing and SLA theory in general. This thesis examines L1 effects on the processing of L2 English relative clauses. It builds on established models of L1 relative clause processing (e.g., Gibson, 1998) and focuses on the asymmetry observed in the processing of subject versus object relative clauses. Research has shown that L1 individuals find object relative clauses more difficult to process than their subject counterparts (King &amp; Just, 1991), and off-line L2 research suggests that this asymmetry might hold for L2 processing as well (Izumi, 2003; Kanno, 2007). This thesis will examine the asymmetry on-line and investigate the role that L1 background plays in on-line performance, both alone and in combination with other processing factors. The main data are on-line performance by three groups of advanced-level learners of L2 English from Japan, China, and Vietnam. The three L1s differ from English to varying degrees in relative clause formation, as reflected in head direction, branching direction and the presence of an overt relative marker. Vietnamese shares all three properties with English and Japanese none, leading to the prediction that the Japanese learners will have the greatest difficulty, as evident in the largest subject/object asymmetry in processing times. Evidence for the effect of L1 syntactic properties on L2 processing will be sought in a set of studies that compare processing outcomes for these learners across key individual difference factors in L2 processing, working memory capacity, lexical processing efficiency, and proficiency. The effect of non-structural information, in the form of animacy contrasts and frequency effects, on L2 syntactic processing across the L1 groups will also be examined. By systematically examining group differences across these key factors, the degree and nature of potential L1 influence on the processing of these non-local dependencies can be better assessed. Three groups of advanced-level L2 English learners from China, Japan, and Vietnam, a group of intermediate-level learners in Japan, and native English controls participated in the data collection. Participants were first tested on a battery of individual difference measures that established language proficiency and general processing skill for individual participants and groups. On-line reading data of relative clause structures were then collected and reported in a set of five studies. Study 1 examined reading when the target structures contained high frequency content words, which minimized word recognition demands. Advanced L2 learners took longer to read object relative clauses, and the difference was the greatest for the Japanese group. Study 2 revealed that the subject/object asymmetry and L1 influence evident in Study 1 disappeared when word recognition was effortful, as in sentences with low frequency words, suggesting that L1 syntactic influence may only be evident when lexical processing is relatively automatic. Study 3 examined the effect of proficiency differences on processing outcomes by comparing performance by Intermediate and Advanced Japanese learners. The Intermediate learners showed no subject/object asymmetry in sentences with high frequency words, providing further evidence that processing efficiency is a key factor when considering possible L1 effects in L2 processing. Study 4 demonstrated that advanced L2 learners benefited from animacy cues in on-line processing, with the difficulty associated with object relative sentences and the L1 effect evident in sentences with animate head nouns neutralized in sentences with inanimate head nouns. The findings indicate that L2 learners may rely on lexical information as an alternative to syntactic knowledge in some cases. Finally, Study 5 compared processing performance on full or reduced relative clauses to examine both the influence of L1 syntactic properties and L1 structural frequency biases on L2 processing outcomes. Although the influence of frequency information was not evident, the results suggested that the availability of an overt relative marker in the L1 affected L2 processing outcomes. Overall, the results provide some support for the view that L1 background influences the processing of complex syntactic structures in the L2, a finding consistent with Juffs (2005) but contrary to Clahsen et al. (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). However, the effect is sensitive to a range of factors, which appears to support the claim by the latter that L2 learners may rely more on lexical-semantic information than L1 individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relative clause</field><field name="subject">syntactic processing</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer</field><field name="subject">L2 processing</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">word recognition</field><field name="subject">proficiency</field><field name="subject">animacy</field><field name="subject">structural frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Federalism and local government in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Berbudeau, C.

The thesis unpacks the ways in which such regimes are deployed using specific technologies: neo-liberal precepts on economic development. To that end, I pose a set of questions which can be summarized in these two: How has higher education in Africa discursively construed Africa&#8217;s experiences? Second, in which terms such constructions have helped responding to Africa&#8217;s problems of development? Taking Mozambican higher education as a unit of analysis, I used postcolonial theory to unsettle neo-liberal regimes of development and to show how contingent they are. Methodologically, a historical critique was carried out to historize neo-liberal globalization as a contingent process and to understand multiple possibilities of construing Africa&#8217;s experiences. My data consisted of texts discussing ways in which Africa is discursively understood by both, African and Western scholarship, higher education policy in Mozambique, interviews with senior administrators of some Mozambican higher education institutions and text materials from higher education institutions&#8217; websites in Mozambique. The findings suggest that, on the one hand, constructions of Africa as being in crisis are not new. In fact, for centuries Africa has always been a subject of knowledge from which the West constructs its differences. It is from such differences that the West assumed a civilizing mission in order to integrate African peoples in the world order. On the other hand, African scholars&#8217; responses to Western constructions of Africa&#8217;s experiences end up building another crisis at the theoretical level: the difficulties of thinking effectively on Africa so as to solve its problems. The second finding is that Mozambican higher education&#8217;s responses to the crisis have been marked by a development agenda within the broader context of Mozambique&#8217;s history from late the 1970s onwards: first, within the socialist model of central planning economy and, second, within the international agenda of global neo-liberal market economy. My analysis suggests that both development practices reflect, to some extent, continuities of colonial regimes of development which did not take into account the contextualities of the colonized. Finally, my investigation found that higher education institutions in Mozambique are responding to development challenges based on very technological conceptions of development following global trends. The thesis contends that an engagement with the ethics of knowledge and development would lead to a development model more preoccupied with the social contexts beyond market rationalities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Africa, developmentalist discourses, higher education, historical critique, neo-liberal globalization, postcolonial theory, post-independent Mozambique, regimes of knowledge.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hartz revisited: German liberalism and the fragment cultures of 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland</field><field name="creator">Christopher Herde</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of the relationship between migrants&#8217; ideology and the dominant political culture in their host country, exploring what happened to German liberal migrant politicians in 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland. It does this by using Louis Hartz&#8217;s fragment theory which he developed in The Liberal Tradition in America and The Founding of New Societies. Hartz argues that the crucial factor in the political development of the new settler new societies was the migration of a fragment of European society bound by a common Weltanschauung or world view. In the United States, Hartz identifies the relevant group as the Puritans who fled Britain in the 17th century, and whose Calvinism he links to Lockean liberalism. Hartz and his collaborator Richard Rosecrance, who wrote the Australian section of New Societies, argue Australia was shaped by the lower-middle and working-class migrant fragment, inspired by political reform movement in England, and who arrived in the first half of the 19th century armed with a utilitarian-radical ideology. With no strong opposition these fragments congeal without reference to Europe and stagnate into monolithic political cultures where all the disparate elements merge into a broad - although at times quarrelsome &#8211; national consensus. According to Hartz, this consensus is re-enforced by the individualist capitalism of The American Dream or the radical collectivism of The Australian Legend &#8211; which become the foundation of the two nations&#8217; respective national character. Hartz acknowledges that the new migrant from Europe is a constant threat to this political-cultural status quo. However, he says by &#8220;consciously articulating the fragment ethic&#8221;, the new migrant is absorbed, keeping in check the ideological challenges inherent in migration. This thesis argues that, in the case of the German liberals, who left their homeland in the 1840s and 1850s, the process was more complex than the one Hartz describes. In Wisconsin, German liberalism was most aligned to Jeffersonian democracy and the Germans either rejected outright or never fully embraced other strands within the political consensus such as Puritan moralism, Jacksonian democracy and Hamiltonian federalism. In Queensland their German liberalism was most compatible with utilitarianism and the Germans rejected most elements of classical liberalism, the evangelical element within social liberalism and the working-class radicalism of the Labor Party. They accepted Jeffersonian democracy and utilitarianism in their respective new homes because they were closest to their core German liberal principles of secularism, the primacy of the rule of law, romanticism, opposition to the aristocracy, and an aversion to rampant capitalism. Most important, however, were their attitudes towards the Staat and Volk. The Staat was both as a potential enemy and also a vital ally in liberal reform and the Volk were seen as potential colleagues in a liberal state but also as a danger to stability. Over the course of their careers they ideologically realigned, leaving parties and factions whenever challenged and using their German liberal ideals as their political reference point.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Louis Hartz, Queensland, Wisconsin, 19th century, US political culture, Australian political culture, fragment, German liberalism, migration, political history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theoretical and empirical investigation of the health education curriculum in secondary schools in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Thomas I.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">730301 Health education and promotion</field><field name="subject">740200 Secondary Education</field><field name="subject">9303 Curriculum</field><field name="subject">Health education -- Queensland -- Curricula</field><field name="subject">School hygiene -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Brisbane overseas Chinese community 1860s to 1970s: Enigma or conformity</field><field name="creator">Fisher, Joan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420211 Chinese</field><field name="subject">370302 Social and Cultural Anthropology</field><field name="subject">750901 Understanding Australia's past</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Queensland -- Brisbane</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">William Pettigrew 1825 - 1906: Sawmiller, surveyor, shipowner and citizen.

Project aims were to document the chondrichthyan bycatch composition in order to test the effectiveness of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), to examine biological aspects of bycatch species, and to combine data collected through these parts to assess the conservation status and sustainability of bycatch species. A total of 37 chondrichthyan species (one holocephalan, 19 batoids and 17 sharks) from 18 families were recorded in the bycatch of the fishery. The most speciose families recorded were the stingrays (Dasyatidae; 7 species), the requiem sharks (Carcharhinidae; 5 species), the catsharks (Scyliorhinidae; 4 species) and the stingarees (Urolophidae; 3 species). Chondrichthyan bycatch was highly variable between fishery sectors; catch rates were low in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector (north Queensland; 0.02&#8211;0.12 individuals ha-1 trawled) and in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector (southern Queensland; 0.08 individuals ha-1 trawled), intermediate in Hervey Bay (southern Queensland; 0.25 individuals ha-1 trawled) and in the scallop sector (central Queensland coast; 0.31 individuals ha-1 trawled) and highest in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector (southern Queensland; 0.96 individuals ha-1 trawled). Chondrichthyan bycatch in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector was dominated by the three batoids Aptychotrema rostrata, Trygonoptera testacea and Urolophus kapalensis (~92% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector by the skate Dipturus polyommata and the two catsharks Asymbolus rubiginosus and Figaro boardmani (~83% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the scallop sector by the three batoids A. rostrata, Neotrygon kuhlii and Neotrygon picta (~91% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), and in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector by the two batoids Himantura astra and Gymnura australis and the two sharks Chiloscyllium punctatum and Hemigaleus australiensis (~67% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number). The testing of TEDs and BRDs, which are mandatory throughout the fishery, demonstrated only a limited ability to reduce chondrichthyan bycatch in the ECTF, which is comprised mainly of relatively small species. The shorter trawl durations of the surveys compared with normal commercial activities may have under-represented larger species. No significant reductions in chondrichthyan bycatch were found using a TED and a radial escape section BRD in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector, using a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector, or using a TED and a fisheye BRD in Hervey Bay. There was however, a significant difference in the probability of capturing the group &#8216;sharks and guitarfishes&#8217; (comprised largely of A. rostrata) between codend types in the scallop sector, with the lowest probability of capture in nets fitted with both a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD (the difference was largely attributed to the effects of the TED). In the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector, in which three different BRDs were trialed (fisheye, square-mesh codend, square-mesh panel), the probability of capturing chondrichthyans was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD than in the standard (control) net, and the probability of capturing batoids was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD or with a square-mesh codend BRD than in the standard (control) net. The small sample size of chondrichthyan catches in some sectors may have reduced to power to detect bycatch reduction. The biology of several bycatch species from the families Rajidae, Rhinobatidae, Urolophidae and Scyliorhinidae was examined. For D. polyommata, size at birth was estimated at ~100&#8211;110 mm total length (LT), size at first feeding at ~105&#8211;110mm LT, size at 50% maturity (LT50 and 95% CI) at 321 (305&#8211;332) mm LT for females and 300 (285&#8211;306) mm LT for males. Diet (described by the index of relative importance as a percentage) was predominantly crustacean based, with carid shrimps (53.6%) and penaeoid prawns (23.3%) being the most significant prey groups. For A. rostrata, size at birth was estimated at &lt;170 mm LT, size at 50% maturity (LT50 and 95% CI) at 640 (618&#8211;663) mm LT for females and 597 (551&#8211;649) mm LT for males, and litter size was 9&#8211;20 (n = 9; mean &#177; S.E. = 15.1 &#177; 1.2). For T. testacea, size at birth was estimated at 77&#8211;100 mm disc width (WD), size at 50% maturity (WD50 and 95% CI) at 163 (156&#8211;169) mm WD for females and 146 (140&#8211;150) mm WD for males, and litter size was always one (n = 6). For U. kapalensis, size at birth was estimated at 75&#8211;100 mm WD, size at 50% maturity (WD50 and 95% CI) at 154 (145&#8211;160) mm WD for females and 155 (149&#8211;159) mm WD for males, and litter size was always one (n = 16). The catsharks A. analis, A. rubiginosus and F. boardmani were all confirmed as single oviparous species (carrying only one egg case in each uterus at one time). Ovarian fecundity (the number of vitellogenic follicles) averaged 13.6 (range 13&#8211;20) in A. analis, 13.5 (range 5&#8211;23) in A. rubiginosus and 10.4 (range 9&#8211;13) in F. boardmani. While only limited data were available from southern Queensland, several indicators suggest that Asymbolus catsharks are reproductively active year-round. A general lack of small-sized or immature catsharks captured during the study made assessments of size at maturity difficult for these species. The conservation status of ECTF bycatch species was examined through the application of the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM Categories and Criteria, which considers extinction risk at the global level. Of the 24 ECTF chondrichthyan bycatch species evaluated against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, four have been assessed globally as Vulnerable (a threatened category indicating that a species is &#8216;facing a high risk of extinction in the wild&#8217;), seven as Near Threatened, 11 as Least Concern and two as Data Deficient. While the four globally threatened species (A. nichofii, Heteroscyllium colcloughi, Rhynchobatus australiae and Urolophus sufflavus) were only minor components of the ECTF bycatch, their global conservation status warrants that fisheries management and industry should act to ensure minimal impacts on these species. An ecological risk assessment method (Susceptibility-Recovery Analysis) was used to assess the relative sustainability or risk of individual species to the fishing activities of the ECTF. Two separate approaches were taken to the technique, which considers sustainability to be dependent on the susceptibility of a species to the fishery and the recovery potential of a species after depletion by fishing activities. The first approach applied the precautionary principal when data were lacking for the calculation of recovery attributes, while the second used biological data from similar species when species-specific data were lacking. The precautionary approach tended to overestimate risk to poorly known oviparous species. The biological approach suggested that A. nichofii, F. boardmani, Rhizoprionodon acutus, Rhizoprionodon taylori and Rhynchobatus palpebratus face the least risk (i.e. were the most sustainable) while several medium-large batoids and the sharks Loxodon macrorhinus and Heteroscyllium colcloughi were the species most at risk (i.e. least sustainable). Demonstrating ecological sustainability of the ECTF will need to be a continued management objective into the future. To further improve the ecological sustainability of the fishery in relation to sharks, batoids and holocephalans, a number of management recommendations are proposed: (1) give warranted conservation consideration to listed threatened species as well as species identified as being at risk; (2) expand required logbook information on chondrichthyan species to include recording of catches of these species; (3) encourage safe release practices for all chondrichthyans to maximise survivorship of discards; (4) initiate research into the survivorship of discards; (5) ensure long-term observer coverage on commercial vessels to monitor bycatch levels; and, (6) test and quantify reduced TED bar spacings (presently 120 mm) in fishery sectors which show the highest chondrichthyan bycatch levels, that is, the eastern king prawn (shallow water) and scallop sectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

The main focus of the thesis is on newspaper cartoonists but for the purposes of comparative analysis, there is a discussion of a representative selection of satiric texts across different media (essentially, television and radio) since the mid-1960s, and also an historical survey of the development of graphic satire from its origins during the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Apart from a small number of references, this study does not venture into the vast field of on-line satire, a topic more properly addressed in a separate scholarly investigation. Graphic satire in the medium of the newspaper is of particular interest because of its consistent production and wide circulation, its relative freedom from censorship and libel laws, and the ability of the cartoon image to condense and concentrate issues which would be too complex or defamatory in print or on television. Political cartooning as it is understood today emerged during the early nineteenth century, at about the same time as the modern newspaper and the profession of journalism, but graphic satire also has links with a venerable tradition of the artist as social critic and has historically been associated with movements for social justice and democracy. It is in the context of these latter associations that I consider political cartoonists as belonging to the sphere of the public intellectual. The discussion of cartoonists as public intellectuals is framed against a discourse of decline that has been circulating for more than a decade, acquiring an urgency in this country during the later years of the Howard administration. This declinist narrative covers a number of areas of cultural and political life and is not confined to the Australian context; as British writer Helen Small points out, it is &#8220;an increasingly transnational conversation&#8221; (02:1). Briefly outlined, there is a perception that the terms of public debate have narrowed; that citizens have become disengaged from the democratic process; that between the &#8216;celebrity intellectual&#8217; and the tenured academic, the life of the mind is not what it used to be, and even political satire itself has been seen by some commentators as being in terminal decline. The different arguments about cultural and social decline can be placed under the more encompassing subject heading of an ongoing debate about democracy and in particular, whether it is functioning as well as it should. With the adoption of neo-liberalism as an overarching political ideology by most western governments in the early 1980s, anxieties about whether the principles of democracy were gradually being usurped or even eroded by the primacy of market values have gathered momentum during the past two decades. The volume of these concerns has been amplified in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent &#8216;war on terror&#8217;, with the state&#8217;s increased emphasis on security and control of its citizens being interpreted as threats to some of the basic tenets of the democratic system, such as free speech and the rule of law. In contrast to the various narratives of decline, my thesis proposes that democracy is still very well served by the kind of vigorous and long-standing practice of dissent that the public intellectual represents, and more specifically, the embodiment of this tradition in contemporary newspaper cartoonists. By definition, graphic satire questions and challenges the status quo and at least since Hogarth in the eighteenth century, it has always been a public art-form. Hogarth&#8217;s personal involvement in many of the social issues and philanthropic schemes of his day (such as anti-gin legislation and state care for orphans) also exemplifies an important aspect of the extra-professional work of graphic satirists which further links them to the public intellectual. A commitment to social activism and making use of the different platforms available (for example, public speaking and donating work to charities) in order to support, publicise or promote issues of social justice began with Hogarth and continues with contemporary Australian cartoonists.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian politics, satire, cartoonists, media, art history, public intellectuals, dissent, democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Citizen participation in planning: an examination using some concepts and theories from social and political science, of community decision-making in regional and town planning</field><field name="creator">Fagence, Michael</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning -- Citizen participation</field><field name="subject">Regional planning -- Citizen participation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of manual training in Queensland: 1885-1970</field><field name="creator">Waltisbuhl, Alan Stewart</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Manual training -- Study and teaching -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Industrial arts -- Study and teaching -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lardil properties of place: An ethnological study in man-environment relations</field><field name="creator">Memmott, Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human beings -- Effect of environment on</field><field name="subject">Nature -- Effect of human beings on</field><field name="subject">Lardil (Australian people)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Co-ordination as an aspect of government planning and administration</field><field name="creator">Craig, J.

However, the term 'mild' TBI is misleading because the physical, cognitive and emotional impairments that can follow from mTBI can be significant. In order to provide objective, prognostic measures for diagnosing the severity of mTBI and identifying individuals who may be at risk for poor outcomes a battery of neuropsychological measures for detecting cognitive impairment was evaluated. The Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) is a collection of tests assessing verbal recall, orientation, processing speed and speed of language comprehension. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RSC has acceptable reliability, validity and sensitivity to cognitive impairment that arises during the acute stages of injury. However, no studies have investigated the predictive validity of this instrument. Moreover it is unclear what additional patient or post injury variables could assist in identifying those individuals who may be at risk of poor neuropsychological outcomes following mTBI. These were among the main issues that were addressed across the five empirical studies in this thesis. A pragmatic, prospective, longitudinal and cross-sectional study of the sequelae of mTBI in patients presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Royal Brisbane and Women's hospital was the basis of this project. The first empirical chapter (chapter 2), examined the psychometric properties of two measures of verbal learning and memory and investigated their potential for discriminating between mTBI and orthopaedic controls. The performance of 93 patients with mTBI and 68 participants with orthopaedic injuries was analysed to identify the number of individuals who performed at ceiling on the Hopkins Verbal Learning test (HVLT-R) versus a 5-word test of immediate and delayed recall. While both of these verbal recall measures were effective in separating the mTBI and orthopaedic groups, overall, the HVLT-R was shown to be a more suitable measure for screening for deficits in verbal learning and memory after mTBI. Given the superiority of the HVLT-R as a measure of verbal learning and memory, chapter 3 aimed to examine whether inclusion of this test could improve the sensitivity of the RSC in mTBI compared to orthopaedic and uninjured control samples. Results were generally within the direction predicted. Significant differences were found between groups on the majority of cognitive indices assessed. Both the orthopaedic and mTBI group performed more poorly than the uninjured group on all measures except the Hopkins delayed recognition. Additional performance decrements shown by the mTBI group compared to the orthopaedic group illustrate that factors beyond the general effects of trauma influence performance and may be related to cognitive impairment specific to sustaining mTBI. Overall it was concluded that the revised RSC is a sensitive instrument deserving investigation in assessing the more long term cognitive effects following mTBI. Chapter 4 applied this sensitive battery for investigation of group and individual recovery of neuropsychological test performance and post-concussive symptom reporting up to 3-months after mTBI. A sample of 30 mTBI participants and 30 uninjured controls were serially assessed on cognitive measures and symptom report scales immediately after injury and after 1-week, 1-month and 3-months. Symptom reporting on the Rivermead post-concussive inventory separated the mTBI and control groups after 1-week but diagnostic accuracy was no greater than chance at 1 and 3-months. In contrast the mTBI group performed more poorly than controls on measures on neuropsychological measures acutely, at 1-week and 1-month, with group differences still evident after 3-months. Nonethless, a trend of progressive recovery over time was seen in the mTBI group. In chapter 5, criteria utilising the concepts of reliable and statistically significant change were applied to the data. Overall, 73% of mTBI patients were impaired on one or more tests acutely. Significant recovery was demonstrated by 20% of mTBI participants by 3-months; however recovery remained incomplete for half of the mTBI participants by 3-months. These results highlighted the importance of an individual approach to the assessment of mTBI and support the notion that a proportion of mTBI cases may have protracted difficulties. Chapter 6 extended these findings by showing that the RSC has prognostic ability. It was found that acute neuropsychological performance on the RSC was a significant predictor of performance on an extended battery at 3-months. The final chapter provides a general discussion and synthesis of the findings. In summary, the present dissertation demonstrated that inclusion of a sensitive measure of verbal recall led to improved diagnostic validity of the RSC. Neuropsychological measures rather than symptom reporting were sensitive in detecting cognitive impairment at 3-months. Analysis of individuals showed that up to 50% of the group had failed to &#8211; demonstrate reliable recovery &#8211; that is, make improvements over and above practice effects after 3-months. Finally, acute neuropsychological performance was predictive of long term performance. Overall, the present thesis has identified a short battery of tests that is suitable for assessment of mTBI within 24 hours and may assist in identifying individuals at risk of poor cognitive outcomes after mTBI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Concussion</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological assessment</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological recovery</field><field name="subject">post concussion syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating the landscape: A history of settlement and land use in Mount Crosby</field><field name="creator">Nissen, Judith</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

There are many types of DNA damage inducing agents such as mechanical stress on chromosomes during recombination, chemotherapeutics, ionising and ultraviolet radiation and endogenously produced free radicals. These genetic lesions pose a serious threat to the cell and evoke a rapid and intricate DNA damage response signalling pathway involving many transducer and effector pathways including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, chromatin remodelling, and apoptotic pathways. Genetic mutations within genes in this pathway often lead to genomic instability and cancer. The main effectors of the DNA damage response are the protein kinases ATM and ATR which are rapidly activated in response to DNA damage induction and phosphorylate a large and diverse number of targets including the checkpoint kinases Chk1, and Chk2, the tumour suppressors p53 and BRCA1 and chromatin associated proteins such as H2AX. BRCA1 is a key transducer molecule within the DNA damage response. This is evident from its loss, which leads to defects in many damage response processes such as cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. BRCA1s binding partner BARD1 has also been implicated in the DNA damage response and recent reports indicate that these proteins co-operate in this pathway. This study utilises a multifaceted approach to further characterise the function of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex within the DNA damage response. Firstly we have used shRNA to deplete the BRCA1/BARD1 complex and have shown that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is required for ATM/ATR dependent phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 in response to IR and UV induced DNA damage. In contrast, we have shown that the phosphorylation of a number of other ATM/ATR dependent targets including H2AX, Chk2, and c-jun do not require the BRCA1/BARD1 complex. The study has also revealed that the prior phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 is required for the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. Furthermore, we have shown that these phosphorylation events are required for IR induced G1/S cell cycle arrest via transcriptional induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The second part of this study involved the characterisation of a putative BRCA1 interacting protein &#8211; The KRAB associated protein 1 (Kap1). During this study we have been unable to confirm Kap1 as a bona fide BRCA1 interactor, however we have identified a clear role for Kap1 in the DNA damage response pathway. Using Mass spectrometric phospho amino acid mapping we have identified a novel Chk2 dependent phosphorylation site, Ser-473, within Kap1. Furthermore, we have shown that this phosphorylation event may regulate Histone H3-Lys-9 acetylation after DNA damage possibly regulating chromatin relaxation. This study has also identified a number of novel Kap1 interacting proteins, which appear to be regulated by Kap1 phosphorylation at Ser-473. These interactors may play an important role in the regulation of chromatin modification and/or structure after DNA damage. By studying the role of BRCA1 in the DNA damage response pathway we have not only uncovered a novel scaffolding function for BRCA1 in the G1/S checkpoint but have also identified a novel protein, Kap1, acting within the DNA damage response pathway. This study has identified a role for Kap-1 in the regulation of chromatin structure in response to DNA damage via the ATM &#8211; Chk2 pathway.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BRCA1, BARD1, Kap1, ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, DNA Damage.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Scottish presence in the Moreton Bay district 1841-59</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie-Smith, John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">200208 Migrant Cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">370502 Migration</field><field name="subject">Scots -- Queensland -- Moreton Bay Region</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Queensland -- Moreton Bay Region</field><field name="subject">Scotland -- Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay Region (Qld.) -- Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay Region (Qld.) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the transport system in the growth of coastal resorts: An examination of resort development in south Queensland</field><field name="creator">Prideaux, Bruce Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">690000 - Transport</field><field name="subject">350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">University of Queensland.

It also describes the internal migration of some among them to the North Arm of the Maroochy River in the early 1880s. The latter journey was undertaken in the company of other Germans from the Logan River district and formed part of a pattern of cluster and chain migration to the North Coast. The first chapter in this thesis discusses the early German settlers&#8217; decision to migrate from their homelands, and their economic and societal reasons for migration. The role played by Johann Christian Heussler in the Germans&#8217; choice of Queensland as a destination, and his contributions to the economic development of Queensland through his position as Emigration Agent to the German States, are reviewed. This thesis also attempts to bring balance to the reputation of Godeffroy and Son, the Hamburg shipping line engaged by Heussler, which brought most of the German settlers to Queensland in the 1860s. The company&#8217;s visible commercial strengths such as their size and experience in the Pacific, and their private, internal weaknesses such as failure to adopt new technologies, are examined. Conditions on the Godeffroy vessels are compared with the conditions on ships sailing from Hamburg to America. This approach avoids the usual comparison of German with British sailing ships coming into Moreton Bay. Britain&#8217;s exemplary standards for passenger health were beyond the reach of emigrant fleets who operated under Hamburg&#8217;s older regulations. The research concludes that, in the early 1860s, conditions on the Godeffroy ships for Queensland were superior to Hamburg ships for New York. Furthermore, this thesis describes the 1868 German settlement of Gramzow on the Logan River and compares it to Bethania. The significance of Queensland&#8217;s 1868 lands legislation to the German settlers is explored. It is suggested that the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act is connected to the U.S. Homestead Act, 1862, and a comparison is drawn between the Australian, American and Canadian lands settlement legislation. This comparison enables the further suggestion that homestead selectors of the Logan were part of an international group of homesteaders whose occupational identity was tied to opening the land to agricultural smallholding at little cost through many similar or identical legislative rules that predominantly impacted their economic standing positively. How land orders enabled Logan settlers to increase their land holdings is discussed, as are the negative aspects of the lands legislation such as the upper 160 acre limit on land holding. The migration of early German settlers of the Logan district north to Maroochy occurred under Queensland&#8217;s 1876 lands legislation. This thesis examines the settlement of Germans on the Canando Run along the North Arm of the Maroochy River in the early 1880s, and describes their settlement conditions. Their motives for moving are examined, how the discovery of gold at Gympie affected them is explored, and the establishment of three German businesses at Maroochy is described. A chart comparing the settlers&#8217; land holdings on the Logan with those at Maroochy illustrates that by moving north, some settlers were able to increase their land holdings threefold. The disappearance of Deutschtum (&#8216;German culture&#8217;) after the turn of the century is examined in the final chapter. This thesis asks whether it is appropriate to continue to use the term &#8216;assimilation&#8217; when speaking of Queensland&#8217;s German settler community before and during the First World War. The term appears to draw a veil over the political and economic subjugation of the community during this period. The thesis proposes that it was easier to survive the difficulties of war in rural rather than in urban communities. Although the historiography of the German settlers of Queensland supports an academic conversation on topics such as German emigration, land acquisition and settlement, this thesis focuses on issues outside the boundaries of the current academic thrust. These issues include the settlement of Gramzow in 1868, the homestead provisions in the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act and their origins in lands legislation in America, the services provided through Johann Christian Heussler by the German emigrant shipping line &#8216;Godeffroy and Son,&#8217; the settlement of the North Arm of the Maroochy River by Logan Germans in the early 1880s, and a rejection of the term &#8216;assimilation&#8217; to describe the eradication of German culture in Queensland after 1914. The leitmotif of this thesis is cultural identity and it explores change in German settlers through various aspects of their identity such as their psychological identity, diasporic experiences, language, and legal and political identity after taking citizenship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">German settlers of Queensland, Logan River, Maroochy, German migration to Queensland, Crown Lands Acts, naturalization, citizenship, cultural identity, assimilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Group opinion change and reintegration of deviant group members</field><field name="creator">Khai Huei Chan</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigates two theoretically novel processes of change in groups relevant to agents for change. Specifically, it examines the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on group members&#8217; evaluation of ingroup change-agents. Group opinion change is operationalized as the group adopting the position advocated by a change-agent, and reintegration is operationalized as the group responding more positively towards a change-agent. These formulations of change processes within groups extend past theorizing in opinion deviance research (e.g., Festinger, 1950; Schachter, 1951; Marques &amp; Paez, 1994) by a) examining how contextual differences that result from changes in the group may affect group members&#8217; reactions to opinion deviates, and b) considering contingencies that result in acceptance or rejection of change-agents and their messages. In addition, this thesis investigates the psychological processes that may mediate and moderate the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on appraisals of change-agents. Specifically, it considers attributed motives of change-agents (i.e., perceived constructiveness; Hornsey, 2005), and target prototypicality (e.g., Hogg, 1993; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987) as two possible mediators of these novel effects. Finally, group members&#8217; identification with the group is examined as a moderator of these processes. Chapter 3 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of group opinion change on the evaluation of change-agents. Experiment 1 (N=100) was a scenario-based study that had a change-agent express a non-conformist view of giving water to an outgroup state at a time when the ingroup state was experiencing a water crisis. Experiment 2 (N=103) was a scenario-based study that looked at a change-agent who expressed pro-immigration views to the ingroup country at an earlier time when popular attitudes toward immigration were poor. In both experiments the deviants were marginalized initially because they endorsed non-conformist opinions. Depending on the condition, group opinions either shifted toward the positions advocated by the deviants or remained unchanged. Results showed group members&#8217; target evaluations shifted as a function of group opinion change. Target evaluations became less favourable in Experiment 1, and more favourable in Experiment 2. There also was evidence that increased perceived constructiveness mediated more favourable target evaluations in Experiment 2. Chapter 4 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of reintegration and group members&#8217; identification on the evaluation of change-agents. Both Experiments 3 (N=103) and 4 (N=94) involved a scenario where there was a severe drought in the ingroup state. In Experiment 3, a deviant politician argued for more investment on water infrastructure 10 years earlier when water shortage was not a critical problem. Thus, the politician expressed a minority opinion. In Experiment 4, a deviant water commissioner expressed a controversial opinion to give water to an outgroup state at the height of the drought. Both deviants were marginalized/excluded initially by the group. Reintegration was manipulated by showing that popular support for the deviant had increased (Experiment 3) or the deviant was reinstated (Experiment 4), or the group did not increase support for the deviant at all (not reintegrated). Results showed that high identifiers evaluated the deviant less positively, and perceived the deviant as more destructive after he or she was reintegrated than when marginalization continued. Further, perceived destructiveness mediated the effects of reintegration and identification on trait evaluations. Experiment 4 also showed that high identifiers were less willing to support change after the deviant was reintegrated, than when marginalization continued. Finally, Chapter 5 tested the interactive effects of group opinion change and reintegration on evaluation of change-agents. I also assessed group members&#8217; responses to change-agents in light of the group&#8217;s resistance to change even though the change-agents were right and the groups were wrong. Experiment 5 was a scenario-based study in a minimal-groups situation that had a deviant arguing for a more equitable research funding than the existing distribution. Experiment 6 was a scenario-based study on the disagreement between Galileo Galilei and the Catholic Church on planetary motion. Again, the deviants initially were marginalized by the groups. For opinion change, the groups either adopted or rejected the deviants&#8217; opinions. For reintegration, the groups either treated the deviants more favourably or continued to reject them. Results showed that either opinion change or reintegration was sufficient to defuse negativity towards the deviants. More importantly, group members continued mistreating the deviants when the groups rejected opinion change and reintegration. That is, negativity towards the deviants was highest when opinion was unchanged, and marginalization continued. Overall, this thesis shows that group members&#8217; evaluations of deviant agents for change can shift as a function of group opinion change and reintegration. Group opinion change and/or reintegration defuse negativity toward change-agents in the absence of psychological threat (i.e., perceived destructiveness). However, if threat is present, opinion change or reintegration may ironically elicit more group members&#8217; negativity towards these targets. This thesis also contributes to the literature by showing how change promotes or inhibits group members&#8217; endorsement of change-agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Deviance</field><field name="subject">Dissent</field><field name="subject">Group Opinion change</field><field name="subject">Deviant Reintegration</field><field name="subject">Rejection</field><field name="subject">Threat</field><field name="subject">Criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineered Surfaces for Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering</field><field name="creator">Peter George</field><field name="description">The interaction of materials with biological systems is of critical importance to a vast number of applications from medical implants, tissue engineering scaffolds, blood-contacting devices, cell-culture products, as well as many other products in industries as diverse as agriculture. This thesis describes a method for the modification of biomaterial surfaces and the generation of tissue engineering scaffolds that utilises the self assembly of poly (styrene)-block-poly (ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) block copolymers. Block copolymers consist of alternating segments of two or more chemically distinct polymers. The salient feature of these materials is their ability to self organise into a wide range of micro-phase separated structures generating patterned surfaces that have domain sizes in the order of 10-100nm. Further, it is also possible to specifically functionalise only one segment of the block copolymer, providing a means to precisely locate specific biological signals within the 10-100nm domains of a nano-patterned surface, formed via the programmed micro-phase separation of the block copolymer system. The density and spatial location of signalling molecules can be controlled by altering several variables, such as block length, block asymmetry, as well as processing parameters, providing the potential to authentically emulate the cellular micro to nano-environment and thus greatly improving on existing biomaterial and tissue engineering technologies. This thesis achieved several aims as outlined below; Developed methods to control the self-assembly of PS-PEO block copolymers and generate nano-patterned surfaces and scaffolds with utility for biomaterials applications. PS-PEO diblock copolymers were blended with polystyrene (PS) homopolymer and spin cast, resulting in the rapid self-assembly of vertically oriented PEO cylinders in a matrix of PS. Due to the kinetically constrained phase-separation of the system, increasing addition of homopolymer is shown to reduce the diameter of the PEO domains. This outcome provides a simple method that requires the adjustment of a single variable to tune the size of vertically oriented PEO domains between 10-100nm. Polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering were manufactured via a method that combines macro-scale temperature induced phase separation with micro-phase separation of block copolymers. The phase behaviour of these polymer-solvent systems is described, and potential mechanisms leading to this spectacular structure formation are presented. The result is highly porous scaffolds with surfaces comprised of nano-scale self-assembled block copolymer domains, representing a significant advance in currently available technologies. Characterised the properties of these unique nano-structured materials as well as their interaction with proteinaceous fluids and cells. Nano-patterned PS-PEO self-assembled surfaces showed a significant reduction in protein adsorption compared to control PS surfaces. The adhesion of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells was shown to be significantly affected by the surface coverage of PEO nano-domains formed by copolymer self-assembly. These nano-islands, when presented at high number density (almost 1000 domains per square micron), were shown to completely prevent cellular attachment, even though small amounts of protein were able to bind to the surface. In order to understand the mechanism by which these surfaces resisted protein and cellular adsorption we utilised neutron reflection to study their solvation and swelling properties. The results indicate that the PEO domains are highly solvated in water; however, the PEO chains do not extend into the solvent but remain in their isolated domains. The data supports growing evidence that the key mechanism by which PEO prevents protein adsorption is the blocking of protein adsorption sites. Control the nano-scale presentation of cellular adhesion and other biological molecules via the self-assembly of functionalised PS-PEO block copolymers Precise control over the nano-scale presentation of adhesion molecules and other biological factors represents a new frontier for biomaterials science. Recently, the control of integrin spacing and cellular shape has been shown to affect fundamental biological processes, including differentiation and apoptosis. We present the self-assembly of maleimide functionalised PS-PEO copolymers as a simple, yet highly precise method for controlling the position of cellular adhesion molecules. By controlling the phase separation of the functional PS-PEO block copolymer we alter the nano-scale (on PEO islands of 8-14 nm in size) presentation of the adhesion peptide, GRGDS, decreasing lateral spacing from 62 nm to 44 nm and increasing the number density from ~ 450 to ~ 900 islands per um2. The results indicate that the spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts increases as the spacing between islands of RGD binding peptides decreases. Further, the same functional PS-PEO surfaces were utilised to immobilise poly-histidine tagged proteins and ECM fragments. The technologies developed in this thesis aim to improve on several weaknesses of existing biomaterials, in particular, directing cellular behaviour on surfaces, and within tissue engineering scaffolds, but also, on the prevention of fouling of biomaterials via non-specific protein adsorption. The application of block copolymer self-assembly for biomaterial and tissue engineering systems described in this thesis has great potential as a platform technology for the investigation of fundamental cell-surface and protein-surface interactions as well as for use in existing and emerging biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Block copolymer</field><field name="subject">polystyrene-block-poly (ethylene oxide)</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnolgy</field><field name="subject">Surface Modification</field><field name="subject">Protein Adsorption</field><field name="subject">cell spreading</field><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">integrin</field><field name="subject">RGD</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualization, design, and scaling of drop generation in coflow processes</field><field name="creator">Manuela Duxenneuner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drop formation, coflow, monodispersity, scaling, dimensionless numbers, microfluidics, microPIV, hydroxypropyl-ether guar gum, Tween, sunflower oil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of factors which contribute to appropriate pregnancy care for Aboriginal women in far north Queensland</field><field name="creator">Humphrey, Michael David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">111402 Obstetrics and Gynaecology</field><field name="subject">111401 Foetal Development and Medicine</field><field name="subject">111701 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health</field><field name="subject">Women, Aboriginal Australian -- Health and hygiene -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="subject">Prenatal care -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="subject">Pregnant women -- Health and hygiene -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Material exchange in mangroves during tidal inundation</field><field name="creator">Maria Adame Vivanco</field><field name="description">Coastal wetlands dominated by mangroves provide important ecological services to the coastal zone, many of which are associated with tidal inundation . In this study I investigated whether all coastal wetlands provide similar ecosystem services, or whether these varied depending on their geomorphological setting and the eutrophication level of the floodwater. Sampling was conducted over two years with significantly different levels of rainfall over six estuaries in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Sediment, nutrient and carbon exchange were investigated in tidal and riverine estuaries dominated by mangrove forests. The estuaries selected also comprised a gradient from low mesotrophic to low eutrophic. Spatial variation within the coastal wetlands was also investigated, comparing nutrient exchange in the low and high intertidal cyanobacteria mat . To assess sediment exchange, I measured retention of total suspended solids and sedimentation rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment deposited in mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon (C) tracer, was used. Nutrient and C exchange were quantified by comparison of concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrogen oxides (NOx--N), ammonium (NH4+) total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in water entering and leaving the mangroves during complete tidal cycles (3 tidal cycles in 6 estuaries for 2 years). Finally, the biogeochemical function of the cyanobacteria mat was measured through experiments investigating nitrogen fixation (N) and nutrient exchange in the extensive mats in the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia. My results show that the seaward fringe mangrove retains the majority of sediment entering the wetland during a tidal cycle accounting for 52.5 &#177; 12.5 % of the total sedimentation (fringe mangrove + scrub mangrove + saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat). Geomorphological setting had a stronger influence on spatial patterns of deposition than on sedimentation rates. Riverine mangroves had more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the seaward fringe mangrove zone. The presence of glomalin in sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting. Glomalin was primarily delivered to riverine mangroves and deposited within the scrub mangrove zone, while tidal mangroves received less glomalin during tidal inundation and most of it was deposited within the fringe mangrove zone. Overall, NOx--N concentrations decreased in the floodwater after flooding the coastal wetland, suggesting that these ecosystems act as sinks of dissolved NOx--N during tidal inundation. In average, NOx--N concentrations in the floodwater decreased 28 %. Additionally, during periods of high rainfall the decrease in nutrient concentrations was more pronounced, and not only NOx--N but also SRP and NH4+ concentrations decreased to up to 51 % and 83 %, respectively. My results suggest that rainfall enhances nutrient removal by coastal wetlands in the region. Geomorphological setting also affected nutrient removal. Riverine mangroves received stronger nutrient pulses, which resulted in strongest rates of nutrient removal during tidal inundation. Nutrient removal was closely related to the nutrient concentration of the floodwater: high nutrient removal occurred when floodwater was rich in nutrients. The C entering the wetland in the floodwater was mainly composed of DOC and its exchange did not vary among sites with differing geomorphological setting. However, DOC exchange was strongly affected by the water quality of floodwater inundating the coastal wetland. DOC concentrations were higher in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH4+ and SRP, suggesting DOC import. Contrary, DOC concentrations were lower in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH4+ and SRP, suggesting DOC export. The high intertidal cyanobacteria mat was important in regulating N fluxes in coastal wetlands. In the arid Exmouth Gulf, where cyanobacteria mats are abundant, nitrogen fixation rates were 4.9 &#177; 3.2 nmol cm-1 h-1. Cyanobacteria mats also removed N from the floodwater in the form of NOx--N (0.47 &#177; 0.45 g m-2 h-1) and NH4+ (0.31 &#177; 0.02 g m-2 h-1). N fixation and nutrient removal from the floodwater was highly variable spatially and temporally. N fixation rates were highest during the day in the mat situated at low tidal elevations. Overall, I found that the material exchange in coastal wetlands is variable within the coastal zone as a result of natural factors, such as geomorphology, vegetation composition and rainfall. But material exchange in wetlands is also affected by anthropogenic factors, particularly eutrophication. From all these factors, eutrophication of the floodwater appears to be the most critical, shifting the mangrove function from a DOC source to a nutrient and DOC sink. Approximate thresholds of nutrient and C concentrations in the floodwater that are likely to trigger shifts in ecosystem function in coastal wetlands in Southeast Queensland, and thus in the ecosystem services they provide, are 0.02 mg L-1 of SRP, 0.04 mg L-1 of NH4+ and 7.5 mg L-1 of DOC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal wetlands, mangroves, tidal exchange, nutrients, carbon, nutrient pollution, eutrophication, ecosystem services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Queensland public sector: Assessing the Goss government reforms</field><field name="creator">Cork, Julie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360202 Public Administration</field><field name="subject">750605 Public services management</field><field name="subject">Civil service reform -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Public administration -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Administrative agencies -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Closer unity in the Queensland trade union movement 1900-1922</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, John Brian</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Labor unions -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning and federalism : with particular reference to Australia and Canada</field><field name="creator">Wiltshire, Kenneth W.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360103 Federalism and Intergovernmental Relations</field><field name="subject">750603 Federalism in Australia</field><field name="subject">Federal government -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Federal government -- Canada</field><field name="subject">Intergovernmental fiscal relations -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Intergovernmental fiscal relations -- Canada</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of expediency: Queensland government in the eighteen-nineties</field><field name="creator">McCormack, Jacqueline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Queensland -- Politics and government -- 1891-1901</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the formation of the Brisbane Town Plan</field><field name="creator">Cox, David N.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750803 Urban planning</field><field name="subject">City planning -- Queensland -- Brisbane</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The history of municipal government in Brisbane, 1859-1925 : a study of the development of metropolitan government in a context of urban expansion</field><field name="creator">Laverty, John R.

Among adults in the ages between 30 to 60 years, 24% of males and 9% of females show conditions of SDB, while 82% of men and 93% of women with moderate to severe SDB remain undiagnosed. Polysomnography (PSG) is the reference diagnostic test for SDB. During PSG, a number of physiological signals are recorded during an overnight sleep and then manually scored for sleep/wake stages and SDB events to obtain the reference diagnosis. The manual scoring of SDB events is an extremely time consuming and cumbersome task with high inter- and intra-rater variations. PSG is a labour intensive, expensive and patient inconvenient test. Further, PSG facilities are limited leading to long waiting lists. There is an enormous clinical need for automation of PSG scoring and an alternative automated ambulatory method suitable for screening the population. During the work of this thesis, we focus (1) on implementing a framework that enables more reliable scoring of SDB events which also lowers manual scoring time, and (2) implementing a reliable automated screening procedure that can be used as a patient-friendly home based study. The recordings of physiological measurements obtained during patients&#8217; sleep of- ten suffer from data losses, interferences and artefacts. In a typical sleep scoring session, artifact-corrupted signal segments are visually detected and removed from further consideration. We developed a novel framework for automated artifact detection and signal restoration, based on the redundancy among respiratory flow signals. The signals focused on are the airflow (thermistor sensors) and nasal pressure signals that are clinically significant in detecting respira- tory disturbances. We treat the respiratory system as a dynamical system, and use the celebrated Takens embedding theorem as the theoretical basis for sig- nal prediction. In this study, we categorise commonly occurring artefacts and distortions in the airflow and nasal pressure measurements into several groups and explore the efficacy of the proposed technique in detecting/recovering them. Results we obtained from a database of clinical PSG signals indicated that theproposed technique can detect artefacts/distortions with a sensitivity &gt;88% and specificity &gt;92%. This work has the potential to simplify the work done by sleep scoring technicians, and also to improve automated sleep scoring methods. During the next phase of the thesis we have investigated the diagnostic ability of single &#8211; and dual&#8211;channel respiratory flow measuring devices. Recent studies have shown that single channel respiratory flow measurements can be used for automated diagnosis/screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) diseases. Improvements for reliable home-based monitoring for SDB may be achieved with the use of predictors based on recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA essentially measures the complex structures present in a time series and are relatively independent of the nonlinearities present in the respiratory measurements such as those due to breathing nonlinearities and sensor movements. The nasal pressure, thermistor-based airflow, abdominal movement and thoracic movement measurements obtained during Polysomnography, were used in this study to implement an algorithm for automated screening for SDB diseases. The algorithm predicts SDB-affected measurement segments using twelve features based on RQA, body mass index (BMI) and neck circumference using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). The rate of SDB affected segments of data per hour of recording (RDIS) is used as a measure for the diagnosis of SDB diseases. The operating points to be chosen were the prior probability of SDB affected data segments (&#960;1) and the RDIS threshold value, above which a patient is predicted to have a SDB disease. Cross-validation with five-folds, stratified based on the RDI values of the recordings, was used in estimating the operating points. Sensitivity and specificity rates for the final classifier were estimated using a two-layer assessment approach with the operating points chosen at the inner layer using five-fold cross-validation and the choice assessed at the outer layer using repeated learning-testing. The nasal pressure measurement showed higher accuracy compared to other respiratory measurements when used alone. The nasal pressure and thoracic movement measurements were identified as the best pair of measurements to be used in a dual channel device. The estimated sensitivity and specificity (standard error) in diagnosing SDB disease (RDI &#8805; 15) are 90.3(3.1)% and 88.3(5.5)% when nasal pressure is used alone and together with the thoracic movement it was 89.5(3.7)% and 100.0(0.0)%. Present results suggest that RQA of a single respiratory measurement has potential to be used in an automated SDB screening device, while with dual-channel more reliable accuracy can be expected. Improvements may be possible by including other RQA based features and optimisation of the parameters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field

In common with other media forms, this engagement expresses itself in a variety of ways, including interaction with other readers online and face-to-face at conventions, correspondence with producers, and the creation of textual products. Other features of the discourses and practices of this community may be more specific to the comic book readership. One of the most interesting of these is a participatory belief, widely expressed by readers, that they can influence the story content of the published comic book and that comic books are unique among other media forms in this. In this thesis, I investigate several aspects of this belief, in order to offer a more nuanced understanding of the participatory involvement that readers have in comic books, particularly the superhero comic books that dominate American comic book culture. First, I examine whether this participatory belief is supported by evidence from published comic books by undertaking a content analysis of the letter columns and story pages of comic books. Next, I explore the discourses of online comic book culture that relate to authorship and the boundaries of participation and show how the rules of textual engagement that are held by readers shape the interactions between readers and producers. Finally, I look for alternative participatory spaces that are available to comic book readers, finding these in a contested form of engagement with comic books, that of exploring the fictional universes of the text. This approach imagines the text as the representation of a non-actual world, to which the comic book is an incomplete window. Theorising this mode of engagement leads to a conceptualisation of participation that makes visible a participatory space that has been previously overlooked by academic fan studies, and that complicates the existing models of participatory culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">fan culture</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">comic books</field><field name="subject">fictional worlds</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of public health in Queensland from 1859-1914</field><field name="creator">Barclay, Enid Joan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">111706 Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Public health -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Public health in Queensland 1859-1914</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism trends: Evolution of tourism products market</field><field name="creator">Scott, Noel Robert</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1506 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Biological analogy</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Comparative case studies</field><field name="subject">New tourism products</field><field name="subject">Niche creation theory</field><field name="subject">Structuration theory</field><field name="subject">Triangulation</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doomadgee : a study of power relations and social action in a north Australian aboriginal settlement</field><field name="creator">Trigger, David S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">169902 Studies of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Society</field><field name="subject">379902 Aboriginal Studies</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Doomadgee -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Missions -- Queensland -- Doomadgee</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the ports of Queensland 1859-1939: A study in Australian economic nationalism</field><field name="creator">Lewis, Glen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">690202 Coastal water transport</field><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Harbors -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual Liberty: Intellectual Property</field><field name="creator">Hugh Breakey</field><field name="description">Natural rights theories have powerful reasons to limit the strength, scope and duration of intellectual property rights. These reasons come in two forms &#8211; limitations internal to the basic functioning of natural rights as such and limitations arising from rights-based considerations external to the property right. In terms of internal constraints, all natural rights conform to a variety of conditions delimiting the extent and strength of their application. Such conditions include, inter alia, requirements for consistency, universalisability and non-worsening. Like all rights, natural property rights must fulfil these conditions &#8211; but such rights require substantial limitations in order to legitimate their capacity to unilaterally impose new duties on others. Consideration of these conditions is, I argue, not sufficient to rule out natural intellectual property rights &#8211; but such conditions decisively limit the extent of those rights. By focusing upon the most general and deep-seated mechanisms of natural rights thought, this argument aims to be applicable to all natural rights theories. I argue natural rights theories have good reasons to accept one, if not both, of two conditions in particular: robust universalisability and self-ownership. As strong intellectual property rights violate both conditions, I conclude such rights cannot be justified by any recognisable natural rights theory. Turning to external considerations, I argue all individuals have a right to intellectual liberty &#8211; the right to inform their actions by learning about the world. This is a negative right: it grants freedom from interference in apprehending, investigating and thinking about the world, and in subsequently acting upon what has been learned. I argue this right is grounded in all Enlightenment views of human freedom and flourishing; it is supported by classical liberal State of Nature perspectives, and arises out of respect for human independence, self-governance, self-legislation, self-creation, autonomy and individuality. Acceptance of this right has profound consequences for the strength and scope of intellectual property regimes. I describe the extent we can find this right already operative &#8211; albeit in schematic and inchoate form &#8211; in contemporary intellectual property law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural rights</field><field name="subject">intellectual property</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">legal rights</field><field name="subject">John Locke</field><field name="subject">public domain</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A finger on the pulse : analysis of site location patterns in subcoastal southeast Queensland</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Ian A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Antiquities</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202131</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charitable institutions of the Queensland government to 1919</field><field name="creator">Evans, Raymond</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160702 Counselling, Welfare and Community Services</field><field name="subject">Charities -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Public welfare -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203862</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jewish identity in Brisbane: the youth</field><field name="creator">Trigger, David S.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220404 Jewish Studies</field><field name="subject">420308 Multicultural, Intercultural and Cross-cultural Studies</field><field name="subject">Jews -- Queensland -- Brisbane</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203866</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Wik region : economy, territoriality and totemism in western Cape York Peninsula, North Queensland</field><field name="creator">Von Sturmer, John Richard</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wik-Mungkan (Australian people)</field><field name="subject">Totemism.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Cape York Peninsula -- Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Cape York Peninsula -- Economic conditions</field><field name="subject">Social structure -- Queensland -- Cape York Peninsula</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parliamentary committees : an examination of the purpose and effectiveness of Committees of Enquiry of the Australian Commonwealth Parliament</field><field name="creator">Holzheimer, Raymond</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160601 Australian Government and Politics</field><field name="subject">750600 Government and Politics</field><field name="subject">Parliamentary practice -- Australia.

One approach to improve intestinal absorption of hydrophilic compounds is to co-administer these drug molecules with absorption enhancers to optimize their physico-chemical properties. In this project, novel liposaccharides were used to modulate the aqueous solubility as well as increase the lipophilicity, improve the intestinal permeability and hence, oral bioavailability of hydrophilic molecules. However, the solubility of the drug/liposaccharide mixtures in aqueous system might be poor, therefore, introducing a hydrophilic component such as quaternization of amine derivatives or sodium salt of carboxylic acid is required to modulate hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and in the same time and promote surfactant and ion pairing characteristics of these derivatives. This dissertation illustrates the development of novel liposaccharide absorption enhancers to be used for oral delivery of hydrophilic drugs. This research includes chemical synthesis of new ionic liposaccharides, examination of their physico-chemical properties, and their in vitro and in vivo biological examinations. The work consists of two parts; cationic and anionic liposaccharide absorption enhancers. a) Cationic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers The focus of this work was on the molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel cationic liposaccharide derivatives as drug delivery agents to improve the oral bioavailability of piperacillin as a model hydrophilic drug. These derivatives were designed to possess surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible and biodegradable materials such as glucose, lipoamino acids and lipophilic amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of piperacillin/liposaccharide conjugates were studied to investigate the effect of liposaccharides on piperacillin activity. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers for the oral delivery of piperacillin was assessed in vitro (Caco-2 cells) and in vivo (rat oral absorption). It was concluded that these derivatives did show hemolytic activity in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity), while they increased permeability of piperacillin through Caco-2 cells. However, these promising results obtained from in vitro assay were not confirmed in vivo. viii b) Anionic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers In this thesis, molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel anionic liposaccharide derivatives as absorption enhancers to improve the intestinal permeability of a model hydrophilic drug such as tobramycin were carried out. These derivatives were designed to have surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible materials such as sugar, lipoamino acids and amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Many absorption enhancers have (to some extent) cytotoxic activity, therefore, cytotoxic activity of the novel anionic liposaccharides were examined. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers to increase the lipophilicity of tobramycin and hence, its oral bioavailability, was evaluated through carrying out partition coefficient examination. It was concluded that these derivatives did not show haemolytic and cytotoxic activities in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity). In addition, the permeability of tobramycin into the organic phase (n-octanol) was increased when liposaccharide derivatives were used. The obtained results are promising and encouraging to continue the work to include Caco-2 cells assay (in vitro assay) and oral absorption in rats (in vivo assay) as a prospective work in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sugar, lipoamino acids, amino acids cationic liposaccharides, anionic liposaccharides.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PROFILES AND INSTRUCTIONAL INTERVENTIONS OF READING COMPREHENSION: A Study of Upper Primary School Students in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sri Tiatri</field><field name="description">International studies have shown the reading competence of Indonesian students to be relatively low compared to other countries. Considering the importance of reading comprehension, the current research has two aims. The first is to provide some insight into the identification of students&#8217; difficulty with reading. The second is to investigate the implementation of innovative methods for teaching reading comprehension in the Indonesian educational context. Both studies were conducted in state upper grade primary schools in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia. Study One profiled students&#8217; reading performance. Five measurement instruments were developed, written in Indonesian language. The construction of mental models was also introduced. Two hundred and sixty five Grade Five students from eight schools were measured for their competence in decoding, prior knowledge, comprehension monitoring, construction of mental models, reading comprehension specifically related to a particular topic, and their general reading comprehension. The students&#8217; reading performance profiles were very varied. They showed the importance of each component for the achievement of reading comprehension. The profiles also showed the ability for each component of reading comprehension to compensate each other&#8217;s function to enable the students to perform well in reading comprehension. The best-fit model for the data accounted for 47% of students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. Study Two compared instructional interventions, and examined the way each method worked in the Indonesian educational context. The three instructional intervention methods were Reciprocal Teaching (RT), Instruction prompting students to develop Mental Models (IMM), and Instruction in Question Answering (IQA). Participants were one hundred and twelve students in the Sixth Grade from three primary schools. There were three groups in each school. Group 1 received RT followed by IMM (RT-IMM), Group 2 received IMM followed by RT (IMM-RT), and Group 3 received IQA. Group 3 was considered as the control group, since IQA is the traditional method widely adopted in Indonesia. Instruction was separated into 2 phases. Each phase consisted of four sessions of 30 minutes each over a two-week period. The implementation of IMM-RT tended to improve general reading comprehension more than other methods (RT-IMM and IQA). Interestingly, individuals who had a low performance in the pre-test for construction of mental models, improved their performance in the construction of mental models following implementation of RT at the first phase. The results support a conclusion that the IMM-RT combination is potentially effective for the enhancement of students&#8217; reading comprehension. However, further results showed that, in order to implement RT and IMM in a common state school classroom in Indonesia, the teacher&#8217;s ability to manage and organise the group becomes crucial. Study Three was designed to validate the IMM-RT instructional intervention for improving performances of students with reading comprehension inadequacies, by addressing the limitations found in Study Two. Result showed that IMM-RT had potential for improving students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. The findings of the current study provide some understanding of reading comprehension in an Indonesian educational context. Moreover, the findings will add to the repertoire of educators about issues that need to be considered in implementing innovative methods for enhancing Indonesian students&#8217; reading comprehension.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">decoding</field><field name="subject">prior knowledge</field><field name="subject">comprehension monitoring</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">reciprocal teaching</field><field name="subject">question answering</field><field name="subject">Indonesian context</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Punishment and colonial society: A history of penal change in Queensland, 1859-1930s</field><field name="creator">McGuire, John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390305 Law and Society</field><field name="subject">180110 Criminal Law and Procedure</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">Penal colonies -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preserving our natural heritage - timber</field><field name="creator">Cokley, Keith V.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">050209 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="subject">291405 Timber</field><field name="subject">961403 Forest and Woodlands Soils</field><field name="subject">Wood -- Preservation</field><field name="subject">Wood preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205553</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of the Queensland Labour Party (to 1907)</field><field name="creator">Rayner, Samuel Alan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Labor Party.

HSCT reconstitutes the immune and haematopoietic systems after myeloablative conditioning and inhibits the recurrence of the malignancy by a graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) response mediated by donor T cells. However, significant post-transplant complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) continue to plague the event-free survival of this curative procedure. GVHD is facilitated by donor T cells that recognise histocompatibility antigens on host antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC). Current treatment options for GVHD are focused on these T cells. However, these treatments result in an increased incidence of infection, graft rejection and relapse. A novel means of immunosuppression in GVHD is the use of multi-potent, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). MSC are non-immunogenic cells that actively suppress T cell function in vitro, and can resolve steroid-refractory GVHD in the clinic. Despite their use in the clinic, there is a paucity of pre-clinical data. Our aim was to investigate the in vivo efficacy of MSC to control GVHD while maintaining the beneficial GVL effect, and to begin to understand the mechanism by which MSC exert their immunosuppressive effects. We isolated and characterised MSC from murine bone/bone marrow and demonstrated that they suppressed T cell proliferation in vitro, even at low ratios of 1 MSC per 100 T cells. This was true of both donor-derived MSC, and MSC derived from unrelated donors (third party). Importantly, we observed that MSC significantly reduced T cell production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; in culture supernatants and that IFN&#947; plays a key role in the ability of MSC to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, we examined the effects of donor-derived MSC on GVHD severity and onset in two myeloablative murine models of HSCT. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used as a proof&#8211;of-principle model [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB/c (H-2d)], and an MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used to mimic MHC-matched sibling transplantation [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB.B (H-2b)]. We examined a number of variables related to MSC infusion including timing, dose and route of injection. We found that early post transplant infusion of MSC by the intraperitoneal injection was most effective at delaying death from GVHD, compared to pre-transplant infusion or intravenous injection. Furthermore, we found that the dose of MSC was critical, as infusion of too few MSC was ineffective and infusion of too many MSC exacerbated the development of GVHD. Taken together, these results suggest that timing, dose and route of injection are all important factors to be considered to ensure successful therapeutic outcome. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of action, we conducted timed sacrifice experiments in the MHC-mismatched model to determine if MSC altered cytokine secretion and cellular effectors, such as DC, known to play a key role in GVHD. Despite the fact that MSC given post-HSCT enter an environment full of activated DC and IFN&#947; levels, by day 3 and 6 post infusion, these activated DC and IFN&#947; levels are decreased compared to controls or mice infused with MSC pre-transplant (p&lt;0.05). This confirmed our in vitro data that IFN&#947; played an important role in MSC-mediated immunosuppression. In addition, when we removed a major source of IFN&#947; production in vivo by administering the T cell depleting antibody KT3 to mice with or without MSC, we found that although T cell depletion prolonged survival, MSC were unable to further enhance this effect. This was also true when MSC were used in combination with the conventional immunosuppressant cyclosporine. Finally, we examined whether the infusion of MSC would compromise the GVL effect. We found that whilst MSC could delay the onset of GVHD, in our model they did not alter the anti-tumour effects of the donor T cells. Overall, we have shown that MSC can delay but not prevent death from GVHD when administered at an appropriate time and dose and that IFN&#947; is required for MSC-mediated immunosuppression in our model. These data suggest that patients undergoing HSCT should be monitored for IFN&#947;, and administered MSC when high levels are reached. Whilst MSC may be a promising therapy for patients with severe GVHD, we highlight that further investigation is warranted before MSC are accepted for widespread use in the clinic. The risks and benefits for transplant recipients should be carefully considered before utilising MSC to treat or prevent GVHD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</field><field name="subject">Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)</field><field name="subject">Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)</field><field name="subject">Interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facts, Fiction, Romance and Propaganda &#8211; The Complex Nature of the Sources for Alexander&#8217;s Subjugation of India</field><field name="creator">Michael Welch</field><field name="description">Abstract This dissertation demonstrates that the ancient source traditions which furnish historians with information concerning Alexander the Great&#8217;s subjugation of India are deeply complex and often underappreciated as being such. This is done through a systematic analysis of the various extant and fragmentary traditions surrounding this period. Therefore, the evidence of the authors who wrote about Alexander&#8217;s Indian campaign directly after, or within a generation or so of it, are first discussed. This involves primarily a study of the extant fragments of many of the men who accompanied Alexander himself. This is followed by an investigation into the so-called &#8216;secondary authors&#8217;, or our extant histories of Alexander. The focus here is on evaluating the transmission of detail, bias, and distortion through the various aims, methods and prejudices of these later historians. Following this, there is a discussion of the numismatic evidence relating to the Indian campaign. This involves a study of Alexander&#8217;s &#8216;elephant medallions&#8217; and various coins of the Diadochoi in which the intricacies of our documentary evidence is made evident. Finally, there is included in this dissertation a case study in which the problematic nature of the ancient evidence surrounding this period of the great conqueror&#8217;s life is shown. This is comprised of a detailed analysis of the evidence for the battle of the Hydaspes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Alexander the Great, India, Ancient Sources, Greek Historiography.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of trust in community acceptance of urban water management schemes: A social-psychological model of the characteristics and determinants of trust and acceptance</field><field name="creator">Victoria Ross</field><field name="description">Given the important role that trust plays in acceptance of water management schemes, the current research investigated the characteristics and determinants of trust by developing a social-psychological model of trust in the area of water management and reuse. The research advanced a theoretical understanding of trust by using social identity theory and the relational model of trust as a framework and providing a systematic examination of the relationships between the variables in the hypothesised trust model. The proposed trust model was tested across three potentially different perceived risk contexts; low, medium and high. Analysis through path modelling provided strong support for the hypothesised model. In all three contexts trust in the water authority was a significant predictor of acceptance of the water management scheme, and risk perceptions mediated the relationship between trust and acceptance. In other words higher levels of trust in the authority were associated with lower perceptions of risk, which were in turn associated with higher levels of acceptance. In Study 4, which was set in the high perceived risk context of the proposed indirect potable reuse scheme in Toowoomba, perceptions of risk had the strongest direct effect on acceptance of the scheme, and the trust, risk and acceptance relationship was stronger than it was in the other studies. The relational variables of procedural fairness, identification with one&#8217;s community, ingroup membership of the water authority and a social bond (shared values) with the water authority were all found to impact on trust, either directly or indirectly. In addition, the instrumental variable of the credibility of the authority (measured as technical competence and a lack of vested interests) was found to have a significant impact on trust. Taken together, the results provide support for social identity theory and the relational model of trust as a framework for understanding trust in authorities. The results are also consistent with literature that suggests that the relational and instrumental models of trust are not incompatible (e.g., Edwards &amp; Kidd, 2003; Tyler &amp; Kramer, 1996). The findings from this research program clearly have a practical application for improving acceptance of water management schemes. The combined results demonstrate the importance of trust in the water authority in reducing perceived risk and thus increasing acceptance of schemes. The results highlight the need for water authorities and policy makers to build public trust through procedural fairness, building a sense of the water authority as a member of the community, and through demonstrating technical competence and concern for the interests of the public.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trust, risk perceptions, public acceptance, recycled water, social identity, procedural fairness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biomimetic Orientated Total Synthesis of Neovibsane Natural Products and Comparison of Synthetic Neovibsanes on Neurite Outgrowth Promotion in PC12 Cells</field><field name="creator">Annette Chen</field><field name="description">Neovibsanin A and B are natural products which induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. They belong in the neovibsane class under the rare vibsane natural product family, whose structures are characterized by polycyclic, polyoxygenated cores. Based on a proposed biosynthesis, the synthetic strategy towards neovibsanin A and B involved synthesizing a key enone intermediate. Initial investigation using this intermediate lead to the total synthesis of 2-O-methylneovibsanin H. Crucial to this concise synthesis was an acid-catalyzed, one-pot, four-step cascade reaction. Modifying the reaction condition leads to a different five-step cascade pathway, resulting in the total synthesis of 4,5-bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B. The synthetic trials and tribulations encountered on the road to these final compounds are explored. It is envisaged that other related neovibsane natural products may arise based on this synthetic sequence. 4,5-Bis-epi-neovibsanin A and B, as well as several other structural analogues collected during the synthesis, were biologically assayed using NGF-stimulated PC12 cells. All compounds induced a significant proportion of neurons to extend neurite processes compared to control cultures. The structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the tricyclic core, as well as the 3,3-dimethylacroyl enol ester side chain, may be responsible for promoting a biological response.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neovibsanin a</field><field name="subject">neovibsanin b</field><field name="subject">2-O-methylneovibsanin h</field><field name="subject">biological activity</field><field name="subject">neurite outgrowth</field><field name="subject">natural product</field><field name="subject">total synthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Pathways for Elite Coaching: A Study of Australian Softball Coaches</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Horton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the attributes and experiences that are perceived priorities for recruitment to become a high performance coach in the sport of Softball in Australia. The study was undertaken in the form of 10 cases of nationally identified coaches and administrators (men and women). Each participant was interviewed using semi-structured questions. The interpretive study gave an intensive description and analysis of coach experiences, attributes and qualifications that are perceived as highly desirable for coach selection by Softball Australia for high performance coaches. The basis for collection and analysis of information was via individual cognitive perspectives and perceptions (through interviews) and individual behaviours (through observation) with the intention to interpret and consider the presence of common themes. Findings may serve to identify, support and direct potential high performance coaches and contribute to the effectiveness of formal coaching education programs. The study focused on the sport of softball which has had a mixed profile over time, from one of almost obscurity to that of an Olympic sport. Australia has had an extremely impressive record internationally. It is currently ranked as the world&#8217;s best softball nation based on international performances by the Australian under 19 Men, Open Men, under 19 Women and Open Women&#8217;s Teams (SA 2008). Australia was the only country ranked in the top three in all age groups competing in World Championships. The importance of this study to softball coaches was to encapsulate the reality of how selectors make determination on performance coaching selections, and was this in line with what performance coaches perceive as the priorities. This may have two direct effects on the performance coach. Firstly, it may allow the coach to develop a career path that may best suit their qualities and attributes. Secondly, it may allow the coach to undertake further learning and development in the areas that the selectors perceive the coach does not meet the required standard of merit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elite sports coaching, career pathways, Australian softball</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Generic resemblances?' : women and work in Queensland, 1919-1939</field><field name="creator">Scott, Joanne, 1965-</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

Recent theoretical models have proposed that effector specific words with motor related meaning are represented somatotopically on the primary motor (Brodmann&#8217;s Area 4) and premotor (Brodmann&#8217;s Area 6) cortices. For example, it has been reported that when verbs associated with the hand (e.g., pick) are processed, the primary and premotor areas involved with moving the hand are engaged. However, fundamental methodological problems exist within the reported research. This thesis aimed to address and correct the inconsistencies and methodological limitations within the existing literature to provide more conclusive evidence regarding the involvement of the primary and premotor cortices in processing verbs with motor related meaning. This thesis also aimed to investigate whether the names of effectors (nouns) also involve processing by the motor cortices, either generally or somatotopically. Three behavioural dual task experiments and one fMRI experiment were conducted. Results indicated no evidence of somatotopically organised overlapping activation in the primary or premotor cortex between the various semantic categories of words and related effector movements. However, in the fMRI experiment, motor related verbs in general yielded significant overlapping activity between reading all effector related verbs and moving all effectors in the pre-supplementary motor area of the premotor cortex. These findings indicate that an embodied language involving somatotopic representations of effector specific verbs on the primary or premotor cortex is unlikely to be the case. Rather there appears to be a more general representation of effector related verbs in a more cognitive than motor area of the premotor cortex. The findings of this thesis are consistent a wealth of evidence supporting the motor cortices being generally associated with motor related language and with the idea that semantic representations are distributed throughout the brain according to the embodied cognitive framework, rather than being localised to amodal regions that process all words.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Motor Cortex</field><field name="subject">Somatotopy</field><field name="subject">Language Comprehension</field><field name="subject">Verbs</field><field name="subject">Nouns</field><field name="subject">Dual Task</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Effector Specific</field><field name="subject">Motor Related Meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of X-ray irradiation on the developing hard tissues of the mandible.</field><field name="creator">Adkins, Kenneth Francis.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jaws -- Radiography.</field><field name="subject">X-rays -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Irradiation.</field><field name="subject">Rats.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209236</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the production, character, and abatement of noise in pneumatic percussive drills.</field><field name="creator">Beiers, John Leonard.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">091301 Acoustics and Noise Control (excl.

To achieve these aims, a case study was designed that used both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to collect data from multiple sources. Data were collected from: (1) a questionnaire of 30 EFL teachers in the English department of a Chinese university; and (2) interviews with four teachers who volunteered to participate in the CoP; and (3) audio transcriptions of ten professional development meetings, blogs and follow-up electronic interviews six months later. These data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The key findings from the analysis of the teacher PD questionnaires and preliminary interview responses showed that although the English teachers in the research site lacked PD experience, they had positive perceptions and expectations for PD activities. However, it was found that PD activities that the respondents had previous attended had been mainly trainer-centred and not relevant to their actual classroom teaching. The teachers reported a need for more opportunities to work with their peers in groups, and for professional development more closely aligned with their needs that considered their other professional commitments and workloads. Based on these findings, a PD program using a Communities of Practice framework was designed to assist teachers to develop new strategies for teaching English oral language skills. Analysis of the transcripts from the PD meetings, post-PD interviews, and electronic interviews revealed that the process of PD implementation was more complex than the initial framework had suggested. First, the outcomes after the implementation of the model varied more than anticipated. The teachers negotiated meanings to enable them to introduce new practices, persisted with their old practice, and adapted, rather than directly adopting, activities. Second, the teachers&#8217; change in practice was smaller than anticipated. Third, the teacher change related to thinking as well as practice. The PD model using a CoP framework was then refined and extended based on these findings. The study also reported an individual case study of one participant&#8217;s (Yang&#8217;s) learning in the PD program. It was found that Yang went through a significant evolution in her learning. She came to the program as an &#8220;outsider&#8221; and a listener who was willing to learn new practice from the other teachers. She experienced various cycles during which she implemented what she learned in the meetings and achieved transformation, which included both adaptation and adoption of new strategies in her teaching. The findings revealed that the process of teacher transformative learning in a CoP was complex, cyclical and requires further facilitation and extended participation in face-to-face group activities. Implications were drawn from these findings about directions for future research including: further research in the Chinese context for deeper understanding of teacher transformative learning in PD, and further research on implementing the model in other contexts to explore teachers transformative PD and to investigate the possibility of extending this model to a larger context. This study is an example of how a professional development model using a Community of Practice framework could be implemented for EFL teacher transformative learning in one Chinese university. The study proposed a model, then refined and extended this model which might be applied to other research contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Teacher professional development, Communities of Practice, China, EFL teacher</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the relationship of bulk density and water in a swelling soil</field><field name="creator">Fox, William Edward.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300101 Soil Physics</field><field name="subject">Soil physics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the relationship between nutrition and infection with nematode parasites.</field><field name="creator">Bawden, R.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD.

One aspect of hearing is loudness, to which the field of psychophysics attempts to ascribe a physical correlate intrinsic to the incoming acoustic wave. For over 50 years psychophysicists have attempted to explicitly define the just-noticeable difference (JND) for loudness: the smallest amount, in physical units, that a stimulus needs to be increased to produce a perceptual difference. A review of the literature suggests that the problem in defining the JND is twofold. Firstly there is the measurement problem, with specific weighting on two competing measures of the JND: the level difference (&#916;L) vs. the Weber fraction (&#916;X/X). Deciding between the two measures has proved difficult: within the natural operating range of the auditory system the two measures are directly proportional to one another. Secondly there is the units problem, concerned with the physical unit in which the measure should be expressed. The units problem exists because it has yet to be determined which property of the acoustic stimulus accounts for the perception of loudness. There are several candidates: acoustic pressure (p); acoustic intensity (I); acoustic power (P), and acoustic energy (E). The necessity of determining which, if any, is the proper measure of the stimulus is forced by the phenomenon of negative masking, which is manifest when the stimulus is expressed in terms of pressure. Selecting among the various quantities is complicated by the fact that the four measures are linearly related and constitute a direct transformation of one another. In the laboratory context existing techniques can produce stimuli that severely challenge the auditory system and break down the proportionality exhibited by the various candidate JNDs. These techniques however require greater scrutiny and development. Buus and Florentine (1991) have proposed that the JND measure (i.e., &#916;p/p, &#916;I/I, &#916;L) that realizes a linear relationship with the detectability index, d&#8217;, is the correct measure. The proportionality of the measures makes such comparison complicated, and threshold values need to be inflated by manipulating stimulus parameters in order to exceed the range of proportionality. This is accomplished using short duration (10-ms) sinusoids and low level masking noise. The experimental program commenced with a series of negative masking experiments to ensure the phenomenon is still relevant to short duration stimuli. Laming&#8217;s (1986) sensory analytical model, which assumes the auditory system responds to pressure, provided an acceptable fit to these data. Experiments on the pedestal effect, a related phenomenon, generated fixed-increment functions that could be compared to the masking functions generated from the negative masking data. A consistent relationship between the two was found when the stimuli were expressed in units of pressure. Attention then turned to improving the studies undertaken by Buus and Florentine (1991) to determine what the proper measure of the JND should be. A series of experiments, differentiated by stimulus conditions, suggest a JND measure expressed in pressure units had the most linear relationship with d&#8217;. The results argue for pressure as the correct measure of the stimulus, and &#916;p/p to be the most qualified representative of the JND.

There is a great demand for DNA sensors that are able to detect single-base mismatches, which are the most common genetic defects that need to be discriminated for medical diagnostic purposes. The development of label free, direct, and fast sensors can be essential in meeting that requirement. Current gene-sensing technology relies heavily on fluorescent labeling of samples but this approach suffers from the disadvantage of time-consuming, expensive and multi-stepped procedures, especially during the sample preparation stage. Although the use of fluorescent labels has overcome the hazards involved with radioactive markers, development of alternative approaches to the traditional assays is still vital to advance the area of DNA sensors. The aim of this research was to develop a one-step sensor, offering direct and specific detection of a target DNA. Nanostructured materials, such as quantum dots (QDs) and self-assembled monolayers, together with hairpin structured DNA probes were applied and investigated for optical as well as electrochemical sensors. The properties of inorganic quantum dots (or nanoparticles), such as narrow and intensive emission spectra, resistance to photobleaching and a wide range of possible surface functionalities, give QDs a great potential as labels in biological sensing applications. Self-assembled monolayers provide well established and versatile platforms for biosensors and hairpin probes, which are able to discriminate single-base mismatches in the target sequences, are ideal components for DNA sensors. Generally, the electrochemical sensors demonstrated a superior response compared to the optical sensors. The best prepared sensor showed sensitivity down to 4.7 fM of target and was capable of detecting single-base mismatches, fulfilling the requirements for a high-quality DNA sensor.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attachment theory and the adjustment to school for young children with special needs</field><field name="creator">Schischka, Janice</field><field name="description">There is increasing evidence that a positive start to school sets the child up for continued positive educational experiences and future life opportunities(Dockett &amp; Perry, 2007). In an inclusive era, it is important to investigate the processes that promote the success of inclusion. This study set out, first, to explore the factors associated with the transition to school for a heterogeneous sample of young children with special needs. Second, it aimed to examine the association between children&#8217;s relationships with parents and their relationships at school as part of their longer term school adjustment. It also set out to explore the patterns of children&#8217;s interactions with their chief caregivers. A mixed method design was used, employing three survey-like measures and semi-structured interviews. Additionally, the case studies of seven of the children are described. The participants were 17 children with a variety of special needs, their parents, teachers, teacher aides, and peers. Several children were determined to be well adjusted on the basis of their relationships, while others were deemed to be less so. In the transition phase, factors that contributed to successful adjustment included high levels of communication and collaboration between families and schools before and after the child&#8217;s school entry. Teachers contributed to successful adjustment by using differentiation practices. Child characteristics played a role by influencing patterns of interactions and the nature of relationships between children and other participants. Further, the nature of relationships (whether they were positive or negative) between children and other participants influenced the nature of relationships between families and schools. Finally, the nature of interactions and relationships influenced both the transition and adjustment to school. No statistically significant associations were found between children&#8217;s relationships with parents and their relationships with teachers, teacher aides, or peers. It is likely that the lack of statistically significant associations between the three sets of relationships was due to the insufficient statistical power resulting from the small sample size, rather than to any lack of linkages between these relationships. These results are discussed in terms of implications for educational practice and for future research directions. Recommendations for practice include high levels of ongoing ii communication and collaboration between families, schools, and other professionals before and after school entry. Other suggestions include the drawing up of a national, mandatory policy for the school transition of young atypical children, incorporating the assembling of a collaborative team of personnel, holding transition meetings to which all the stakeholders in the child&#8217;s life are invited, and allowing multiple opportunities for the child and their family to visit their new school setting prior to starting. Recommendations for future research include interviewing the target children about their own transition, and making direct observations of the interactions of young children with special needs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5884</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple perspectives on the education of mathematically gifted and talented students : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bicknell, Brenda Anne</field><field name="description">This study examines multiple perspectives on the education of a group of fifteen Year 6 and Year 8 students identified as mathematically gifted and talented. The students&#8217; mathematical experiences, both past and present are examined using evidence from school policy documents; student, teacher, and parent interviews; questionnaires; and classroom observations. The purpose of this case study was to seek understandings about awareness of the characteristics of mathematically gifted and talented students, the identification of and educational provisions for mathematically gifted and talented students, parental involvement, and school transfer. The group of fifteen students consisted of ten Year 6 students who transferred from primary school to a new school for Year 7, and five Year 8 students who moved to secondary schools for Year 9. These students had been identified by their school and teachers as gifted and talented in mathematics. This predominantly qualitative study is underpinned by an interpretive paradigm and influenced by a sociocultural philosophy of learning and teaching. The literature review presents the dilemmas, similarities, and differences that prevail in the field of gifted education. A more specific focus is given to the education of mathematically gifted students to highlight gaps in the field. This two-year study tracking a group of students provides a cohesive approach to understanding the educational provisions for students identified as mathematically gifted and talented in the New Zealand setting. The multiple case studies included interviews, questionnaires, documents, and observations. The research findings show that there is not a comprehensive understanding by schools and teachers about the characteristics of mathematically gifted students. Despite the documentation of a range of identification processes in school policies, a multiple method approach is not practised in many schools. Provision of appropriate programmes is variable and determined by factors such as school organization, identification, teacher knowledge and expertise, and resources. Parents play a key role in their children&#8217;s mathematics education as motivators, resource providers, monitors, mathematics content advisers, and mathematical learning advisers. Schools, teachers, parents, and peers all contribute to the success of a student&#8217;s transfer from one phase of schooling to another; they support a student&#8217;s social and emotional well being and influence curriculum continuity in mathematics. This study provides insights into the various determinants of the development of mathematical talent. For New Zealand schools and teachers, it provides evidence that understanding the characteristics of mathematical giftedness is important and that identification processes must reflect this understanding. Provisions must be well considered and evaluated; the role of parents should be understood and valued; and home-school communications strengthened. Together, all stakeholders share a critical role in the education of mathematically gifted and talented students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">mathematics study and teaching</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330108 Special education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of fouling in dairy processing : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Hayden Albert Edward</field><field name="description">Fouling of heat treatment equipment in the dairy processing industry is an expensive and persistent problem. The objective of this work was to develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of dairy fouling in heat exchangers and identify methods to control this build-up. This was part of a larger project investigating the interaction between spore-forming thermophilic bacilli (thermophiles) contamination and fouling deposits on internal surfaces of equipment. Two systems were developed to monitor the onset and build-up of fouling on the internal surfaces of two research heat exchangers. The first used a commercial sensor to measure the local heat flux and the temperature on the hot side of a plate type heat exchanger. The heat transfer coefficient was calculated and normalised with its value at the start of the run to reflect the contribution of fouling deposits to the thermal resistance, thus giving a real-time estimate of the rate of fouling. The second system used an energy balance over a tubular type heat exchanger and measured inlet and outlet temperatures to estimate the overall heat transfer coefficient thus giving a global measurement of fouling over the tubular heat exchanger. In both systems the plot of normalised heat transfer coefficient over time often stayed constant over an induction period, which was followed by a falling period indicative of growth in the fouling layer thickness and/or mass. Each system was validated by comparing the final value of the normalised heat transfer coefficient with direct measurements of fouling made at the end of a run namely: fouling deposit height for the local measurement and fouling deposit mass for the global measurement. The normalised heat transfer coefficient reported by each system correlated well with the corresponding direct measurement of the fouling layer. An important factor identified in this study was the effect of air bubble nucleation on fouling deposits. It was shown that bubbles that formed on the heated surface greatly reduced the length of the induction period to a matter of seconds rather than hours, as found in previous studies of fouling in the absence of surface bubbles. The rate of fouling was also enhanced while the bubbles remained at the surface. The structure of bubble type fouling layers was linked to the behaviour of the bubbles at the heated surface. Visual observations of these bubbles showed evidence of growth, vibration and coalescence during their period of attachment to the heated surface. Deposits from bubble type fouling consisted of all solid components found in the original milk solution, except lactose, in approximately the same ratio. By contrast fouling deposits reported in the literature with systems operating under the traditional protein denaturation mechanism were reported to consist mainly of whey proteins. Bubble induced fouling can be limited in a number of ways, the most effective being to maintain a high operating pressure in the equipment to ensure nucleation does not occur. Experiments conducted in this study showed that a pressure of 130 kPa.g was sufficient to suppress all bubble nucleation at the heated surface at a temperature of 90&#176;C. Another method identified was the use of high linear fluid velocities to entrain any surface bubbles into the processing stream immediately upon nucleation. Linear velocities above 1.0 m/s were shown to achieve this goal in the miniature plate heat exchanger tested. However, this method is only partially successful because the local linear velocity varies with position in heat exchange equipment of complex geometries and can drop below the mainstream average velocity causing surface bubbles to form, especially in recirculation regions behind flow obstacles. A more reliable method, in situations where high operating pressures could not be used, involved conditioning the heated surface with a thin protein layer during the first few minutes of a run. Conditioning the surface resulted in bubble suppression even at high temperatures and low pressures, thus greatly extending the length of the induction period. Trials performed in this study showed that the addition of a proteolytic enzyme produced by psychrotrophic microbes greatly increased fouling. The enzyme destabilised the caseins which could attach directly to the heat exchange surface independently from the bubble fouling mechanism. Thus the quality of the milk is another important factor to consider. However, the addition of enzymes produced by thermophilic bacilli isolated from milk powder plants did not increase fouling. A theory describing the air bubble induced fouling mechanism is presented along with recommendations on how to reduce this fouling contamination in processing equipment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">dairy processing equipment</field><field name="subject">heat exchanger</field><field name="subject">fouling deposits</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of two ultrafiltration membrane systems for whole milk feta cheese production : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chollangi, Anusha</field><field name="description">Cheese is one of the most well known food products in the world dating back to the 8th century B.C. There are more than 2000 varieties of cheese that are manufactured all over the world. Feta cheese is a soft white cheese with a salty and slightly acidic taste, which has originated from Greece. Most of the feta cheese manufactured in Greece is consumed locally, the migration of greeks to other parts of the world led to a demand for feta cheese outside of Greece. The spreading of the popularity of feta cheese to other ethnic groups in different parts of the world resulted in the high demand for feta cheese worldwide. The modern and most efficient method of feta cheese production involves a membrane filtration method, known as ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration process utilises pressure as a driving force to concentrate milk by removal of water and small dissolved molecules. Hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration membranes are the two types of membranes that are commonly used for cheese production. An extensive amount of research exists on the implementation of ultrafiltration to improve the efficiency of the cheese making process and the performance of the membranes. However, limited research has been conducted on the comparison of the hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane performance in the cheese making process. The objective of the research was to determine if the hollow fibre membranes used at Puhoi Valley Cheese can be replaced with spiral wound membranes without compromising the quality of cheese produced. In order to achieve the objective, feta cheese was produced using hollow fibre and spiral wound ultrafiltration pilot plants. The operating performances of the hollow fibre and spiral wound membrane units were compared. To ensure that the quality of cheese is maintained, the cheese manufactured on the pilot plant units was analysed in terms of composition, microbiology, texture and sensory properties. The cheese made using the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant was compared with the reference sample from Puhoi Valley Cheese as they use hollow fibre membranes to produce feta cheese. The cheese made from the spiral wound membrane unit was also compared to that made by the hollow fibre membrane pilot plant unit. The operating parameters such as the inlet and outlet pressure, pressure difference along the membrane, transmembrane pressure, flow rate, recycle rate (bleed off rate), temperature and the run time were recorded. The operating parameters of the hollow fibre and spiral wound runs were compared with the data from Puhoi Valley Cheese. The quality of cheese made on the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant units were evaluated in terms of composition, texture, microbiology and sensory properties. The composition was defined by the fat, protein, total solids and salt contents. The fat content was determined by utilising the modified Schmid-Bondzynski-Ratzlaff method, protein by the Kjeldahl method, total solids by using the air drying oven and salt percentage by the volhard method. The texture of the cheese was determined by the fracturability and hardness from the compression curve generated using the single bite compression test. The microbiological testing was performed according to New Zealand testing methods for E.Coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coliforms and yeast and mould. The difference from the control method was utilised for sensory evaluation. The acid degree value method was used to determine the lipase activity in feta cheese. It was found from the composition, texture and sensory analysis that the cheese from the hollow fibre pilot plant was different from the cheese manufactured at Puhoi Valley Cheeses (PVC). The spiral wound cheeses were also found to be different to PVC cheese, however the spiral wound cheeses and the pilot plant hollow fibre cheese were the same. The differences between both the pilot plant cheeses and PVC cheese were in terms of the fat, salt, moisture contents and the lipase activity in the cheeses. The fat content in the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses are lower in comparison to the PVC cheese. This difference in fat content is considered to be due to the difference in the fat to protein ratio of the milk concentrated on the pilot plant and the PVC ultrafiltration system. The lower fat content resulted in firmer cheese than PVC due to more cross linking between the protein strands in cheese. The salt content in the cheeses made using the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plants was lower than Puhoi Valley Cheese. This is considered to be due to the low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume used for salting the cheese. The salt content of brine decreases during brining; hence a low ratio of brine volume to cheese volume causes a significant decrease in brine concentration. The decrease in brine concentration decreases the salt intake of the cheese. As salt diffuses in the moisture diffuses out, lower salt content results in higher moisture content in the cheese. As mentioned, the moisture content of the hollow fibre pilot plant cheese was higher than the PVC cheese. The moisture content is inversely proportional to the total solids, hence higher moisture in pilot plant cheeses implies lower total solids than the PVC cheese. The lipase activity results showed that the hollow fibre and spiral wound pilot plant cheeses had higher lipase activity than the Puhoi valley cheese. The differences in lipase activity of the pilot plant cheeses and Puhoi Valley cheese were considered to be due to the incomplete inactivation of lipase present in milk during pasteurisation. The results from texture and sensory evaluation support the above mentioned differences. The microbiology results for all pilot plant cheeses were within the trigger limits set by Puhoi valley cheeses. The results from monitoring the operating parameters of both the pilot plant data show that the permeate flux decreases while the total solids in milk increase with time, which was also observed from the Puhoi Valley Cheese data. However, the rate of decrease of the permeate flux and the increase of the total solids in milk are dependent on the membrane area, feed volume, transmembrane pressure, pressure drop across the membrane and the flow characteristics. The rate of decrease in permeate flux and the rate of increase in the total solids of the hollow fibre runs and spiral wound runs are slightly different. The difference is due to the availability of larger membrane surface area and processing of larger feed volume of milk in the spiral wound runs. The transmembrane pressure and the pressure drop across the membrane were maintained as close as possible to Puhoi Valley Cheese. In conclusion, spiral wound membranes can be used to achieve the desired total solids concentration and successfully make the same feta cheese as the hollow fibre pilot plant. In order to make the same quality of feta cheese as Puhoi Valley Cheese using the spiral wound membrane pilot plant, the same composition of milk used for concentration at Puhoi Valley Cheese needs to be used on the spiral wound pilot plant unit. It is recommended that Puhoi Valley Cheeses should be replaced with spiral wound membranes if they are more economical in terms of cost than the hollow fibre membranes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ultrafiltration process</field><field name="subject">cheese production</field><field name="subject">Puhoi Valley Cheese</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth development, Maui styles : Kia tipu te rito o te pa harakeke, Tikanga and ahuatanga as a basis for a positive Maori youth development approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Maori Studies at Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ware, Felicity Jane Rachel</field><field name="description">The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa has been seen as an innovative approach to youth development. The E tipu e rea &#8211; Rangatahi Development Package was particularly useful for organisations implementing the strategy with Maori youth. There have been successful Maori youth development initiatives, though these have been ad hoc. Nonetheless, the realities and experiences of Maori youth are still not being fully addressed in national policy. This has implications for the support and resourcing of Maori youth development initiatives. Maori youth are members of a range of groups including whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities in te ao Maori as well as the wider youth population and New Zealand society. The histories, experiences and viewpoints of each distinct group contribute to diversity in the Maori youth population which presents challenges for Maori youth development. Maori development goals do not adequately focus on Maori youth and youth development theory does not fully consider culture. The challenge is to successfully integrate Maori culture and youth culture in a relevant and meaningful manner so that Maori youth can positively contribute to Maori development and wider New Zealand society. This study examines purakau (narratives) about Maui (Polynesian ancestor) as a template for the analysis of Maori youth development. Interviews were undertaken with a group of Maori youth from the Manawatu region. The research showed tikanga and ahuatanga were relevant to the contemporary daily lives of the participants. The study found that positive development and the realisation of potential for Maori youth was affected by individual and environmental influences.

In response to Pdeficiency treatment, plants display alterations in root system architecture caused by changes in primary root (PR) and lateral root (LR) length and LR density. In this thesis, the root growth of the agronomically important legume, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was found to be slightly stimulated in terms of PR length, LR number and total LR length when plants were grown in a P-deficient media (0.01 mM orthophosphate; Pi) when compared with plants grown in a P-sufficient media (1.00 mM Pi) when using a hydroponic growth system. When plants are grown in a P-sufficient media, treatment with 100 nM exogenous 1- aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and exogenous auxin (5 nM 1- naphthylacetic acid, NAA) resulted in significant increases in white clover PR length, LR number and LR length. However, when ethylene action or auxin transport were inhibited using 300 ppm 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and 100 nM 1-Nnaphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), respectively, root growth was significantly reduced which suggests roles for ethylene and auxin in mediating white clover root growth. To examine the effects of these hormones on plants grown in P-deficient media, 100 nM ACC treatment significantly enhanced the stimulatory effects of growth on Pdeficient media only, while exposure of plants to P-deficiency alone was sufficient to significantly neutralise the inhibitory effects of 1-MCP on root growth. Hence, exposure to P-deficiency is proposed to increase either ethylene biosynthesis or ethylene sensitivity in white clover roots. In contrast, for plants grown in P-deficient media, treatment with 5 nM NAA significantly abolished the stimulation of white clover root growth observed with P-deficiency so it is proposed that exposure to Pdeficiency increases either auxin biosynthesis or auxin sensitivity, but the 5nM NAA concentration used was too high to stimulate root growth. Using DR5p::GUS transgenic white clover, auxin activity was found in the root tips and root primordia. Using these plants, it is suggested that P-deficient treatment and ACC treatment influenced white clover root growth through an increase in auxin sensitivity. Overall, ethylene and auxin are found to be essential in mediating white clover root growth in P-sufficiency, and also in mediating root responses to P-deficiency through changes in terms of the biosynthesis and the sensitivity of these two hormones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White clover</field><field name="subject">Trifolium repens L</field><field name="subject">ethylene</field><field name="subject">auxin</field><field name="subject">phosphate</field><field name="subject">phosphorus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1247</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression studies of the ACC oxidase gene family of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Plant Biotechnology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chih-Ming</field><field name="description">Four ACO promoters and four ACO genomic sequences have been isolated and cloned from Trifolium repens L. The promoter sequences were cloned using Gene WalkerTM technology, and are defined as the 5' flanking sequences upstream of the ATG translation start codon, and designated pTR-ACO1 (1006 bp), pTR-ACO2 (1510 bp), pTR-ACO3 (1350 bp), and pTR-ACO4 (1250 bp). To confirm that each 5' flanking sequences represents distinct genes, Southern analysis was undertaken with each of the 5' flanking sequences used as probes. For TR-ACO1 and TR-ACO2, Southern analysis indicated that the genome of white clover contains two copies of each gene, while single copies of TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4 are evident. However, the pattern of recognition of pTR-ACO3 differs from pTR-ACO4 confirming TR-ACO4 as a newly identified member of the ACO gene family of white clover. The four genomic sequences isolated cover sequences downstream of the ATG codon to the stop codon, and each comprises 4 exons interspersed by 3 introns. In terms of sequence identity, for exon 1, identities over the four genes ranges from 69% to 94%, with 94% identity between exon 1 of TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4, while for exon 2, identities range from 60% to 99%, with 99% identity between TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4. For exon 3, sequence identities ranged from 71% to 89%, with 89% identity between TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4, while for exon 4, identities range from 62% to 100%, with 100% sequence identity between TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4. For the intron sequences, significantly lower identities are observed, with again, highest identities were observed for TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4. For intron 1, identities ranged from 40% to 81% with the highest identity of 81% observed between TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4. For intron 2, an identity range of 32% to 72% was observed with 72% identity between TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4, while identity values of 13% to 79%, with 79% between TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4. Analysis, in silico, of the 5' flanking sequences was undertaken to identify putative transcriptional binding domains using the PLACE and Mat-Inspector programmes. The TR-ACO1 5' flanking sequence contains a higher proportion of domains that are associated with young developing tissues, while the TR-ACO2 5' flanking sequence contains domains that are associated with environmental/hormonal cues. In contrast, the TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4 5' flanking sequences contain a higher proportion of ethylene-response and wound associated domains. The expression pattern, in vivo, directed by all four 5' flanking sequences during leaf development has been examined using GUS fusions and transformation into both tobacco and white clover. In tobacco, the pTR-ACO1 directed expression in the terminal bud and in axillary buds of younger leaves, with expression declining in the older tissues. The pTR-ACO2 directed expression in the petioles and mature-green and senescent leaves, while the TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4 promoters directed expression in the axillary buds, petioles and leaves of mature-green tissues and those in the early stages of senescence. In white clover, the TR-ACO1 5' flanking sequence directed highest expression in the apical tissues, axillary buds, and leaf petiolules in younger tissues and then declines in the ageing tissues, while the pTR-ACO2 directed expression in the axillary buds and leaf petiolules in mature-green tissues. The TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4 5' flanking sequences direct more expression in the ontological older tissues, including the axillary buds and leaf petiolules. However, in association with this ontological pattern, all of the 5' flanking sequences directed expression in most cell types examined during leaf ontogeny. In younger tissues, the TR-ACO1 5' flanking sequence directed expression in the ground meristem and newly emerged leaf tissue at the apical bud of the stolon, the ground meristem tissue of axillary buds, vascular tissue, pith and cortex of the internode and node, and the cortex and vascular tissue of the leaf petiolule. In ontological older tissue, the TR-ACO3 and TR-ACO4 5' flanking sequences directed expression in the ground meristem of the axillary buds, the vascular tissue of the stolon and petiolule. However, staining could be observed in the pith and cortex of the stolon, and the cortex of the leaf petiolule, but at a reduced intensity. These expression studies suggest that in leaf development of white clover, the primary cues for the transcriptional regulation of the ACO gene family are ontological in nature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Tobacco</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of asthma in selected Pacific countries : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Epidemiology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Foliaki, Sunia</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I describe a series of studies of the prevalence, causes, and management of asthma in the Pacific. The core study of the thesis is Phase III of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC). The ISAAC study is the largest worldwide epidemiological study on asthma prevalence and was established partly in response to the increases in asthma prevalence in most parts of the world over the last two to three decades. The ISAAC Phase I study found large variations in asthma prevalence globally, but no Pacific countries were involved. Thus, the situation in the Pacific was relatively unknown due to lack of standardised studies on prevalence and time trends. The burden and impact of other non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular and other metabolic disorder on the other hand have been the target of various studies in the Pacific for the past few decades The ISAAC Phase III study was therefore conducted in eight Pacific countries to address the above issues, as well as to enhance Pacific participation and contribution to international research on the causes and control of asthma. The collaboration also served the purpose of encouraging and strengthening health research capacity in the Pacific. The ISAAC Phase III study was followed by an asthma self-management intervention trial conducted in Tonga by the ISAAC Tonga study team. Methods The work presented in this thesis involved: (i) the conduct of the ISAAC Phase III study in the six Pacific islands of Tokelau, Samoa, Fiji Islands, Tonga, Niue and the Cook Islands, as well as the incorporation into the analysis of data that had already been collected in French Polynesia and New Caledonia; (ii) analysis of the data from an environmental asthma risk factor questionnaire which was included in the ISAAC survey in three countries (Samoa, Fiji and Tokelau); (iii) the conduct of the Tonga Asthma Self-management Study which was intended to assess whether the introduction of asthma education, including asthma self-management plans, would reduce morbidity from asthma. Results A total of 20,876 13-14 year olds, in the eight countries involved, participated in the ISAAC Phase III survey, with an overall response rate of 92%. The survey showed that there was considerable variation in the prevalence of asthma symptoms between the eight countries, ranging from 5.8% for current wheeze in Samoa to 16.2% in Tonga. Tokelau reported the highest prevalence (19.7%) for current wheeze, but the number of participants was relatively small. The prevalences of asthma symptoms among Pacific children in the Pacific were lower than those reported for Pacific, M&#257;ori and European children living in New Zealand from a previous study (ISAAC Phase I) conducted ten years earlier using the same methodology. The prevalence of 'asthma ever' in Pacific children living in the Pacific was also lower than that found among Pacific, M&#257;aori and European children in New Zealand. The ISAAC Phase III environmental questionnaire data was collected in Samoa, Fiji and Tokelau. The analyses indicated that the major factors associated with current wheeze (across the three countries) were paracetamol use in the previous year (odds ratio (OR) = 1.36, 95% CI 1 15-1.61), the use of open fires for cooking (OR = 1.34,95% CI 1.13-1.58), lack of physical activity as indicated by television viewing more than 3 hours per day (OR = 1.24,95% CI 1.04-1.47), regular meat consumption (OR = 1.30,95% CI 1.09-1.54) and regular cereal consumption (OR = 1.29,95% CI 1.07-1.54). However, these risk factors were not particular strong, and did not account for a large proportion of asthma cases (i.e. they had relatively low population attributable risks). The asthma self-management plan intervention study resulted in significant improvements in asthma morbidity and the management of asthma among individuals and the service provision. The success of the introduction of the self-management plan, in the context of an asthma clinic, was reflected by improvement in measures of asthma morbidity, such as peak expiratory flow rates and nights woken with asthma or coughing. There was also a reduction in the requirement for acute medical treatment, indicated by a decrease in emergency department hospital visits for asthma and hospital admissions. The programme was so successful that the intervention study evolved into a full regular asthma clinic for the main island of Tonga. It is now intended that the asthma self-management programme will be extended throughout the rest of Tonga, through the primary health care system. Conclusions The ISAAC Phase IIII survey has shown that, although there is a significant level of morbidity, asthma prevalence in Pacific countries is lower than those among Pacific people in New Zealand. Together with the large variations in prevalence between the six Pacific countries that participated, this further lends support for the role of environmental risk factors in asthma. The availability of data on eight countries using a standardised methodology also provides useful information on the burden of asthma in the Pacific that is comparable to other countries regionally and internationally as well as forming a basis for ascertaining trends in the future. The crucial role of asthma self-management plans in asthma management is supported by the findings of the Tonga study, and its implementation is essential in the resource-scarce Pacific health setting. The collaborative nature of ISAAC in the Pacific has further raised awareness of the need for capacity building and creating networks and environments that enhance health research in areas other than asthma. The study has also nurtured an environment and network that encourages and strengthens the establishment of health research as one of the vital tools for achieving better health.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma management</field><field name="subject">Environmental risk factors</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing sustainable distributed generation systems for rural communities : an application of optimisation modelling and decision analysis to include sustainability concepts and uncertainty into design optimality : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Agricultural Engineering (Renewable Energy) at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Murray, Phillip Edward</field><field name="description">The deregulation of the electricity supply industry in New Zealand has led to an increased level of interest in the security of electricity supply to rural communities. This in turn has led to questions about sustainable alternatives to conventional methods of electricity supply. A solution may be the adoption of sustainable community sized renewable energy (RE) based distributed generation systems. However, choosing between the myriad of possibilities requires much data and analysis. An accurate analysis of electricity load and RE resource matching is normally required. In most cases, this is an expensive and time-consuming assessment. In order to minimise these costs, and yet give due consideration to stakeholder preferences and technical uncertainty, a process incorporating the economic, social, environmental, and technical aspects of sustainable design in a relatively short timeframe will be required. This study developed such a method through the integrated use of the wind atlas assessment and analysis program (WAsP), the micropower optimisation model (HOMER), and three methods of decision analysis using Logical Decisions for Windows (LDW) software, which formed the decision analysis framework, SPiRAL (Sustainable Power in Rural Areas and Locations). The efficacy of the integrated use of the software in the SPiRAL framework was tested through two analyses using electricity load and RE resource data from a case study site. The first was an analysis using a full-year of data in a multi-method decision analysis process thus setting the framework in place. A further analysis then tested the minimum monitoring time required to obtain and analyse the data for modelling meaningful results. In both analyses, the results were ranked based on stakeholder preferences between the economic, social, environmental, and technical aspects of sustainable energy systems. The clear representation of the uncertainty of the electricity loads and the RE resources was paramount in the results. The short-term analysis results differed in small ways from the full-term, but were essentially similar. This study developed a decision analysis framework that delivered transparent results in a manner likely to instil insight and confidence in them, and this would provide the decision-maker with much valuable information on which to base their decision.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electricity supply</field><field name="subject">Sustainable energy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oho mauri : cultural identity, wellbeing, and t&#257;ngata whai ora/motuhake : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in M&#257;ori Studies at Massey University, Wellington, Aotearoa/New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pere, Lynne Mereana</field><field name="description">This study, Oho Mauri, seeks to understand the experience of mental illness from the perspective of those it affects most- the consumer. In order to test the assumption that mental health depends as much on culture and identity as psycho-biology, Oho Mauri examines the worldviews of 17 Indigenous people &#8211; M&#257;ori - who have had experience of mental illness (T&#257;ngata Whai Ora/Motuhake). Their views on mental illness, within the context of the recovery approach, constitute the core of the thesis. Oho Mauri examines the relationship between cultural identity and wellbeing, in order to answer the research question: "Does a secure cultural identity lead to improved wellbeing for T&#257;ngata Whai Ora/Motuhake?&#8221; Indigenous people the world over have considered this relationship, generally maintaining that greater wellbeing is a function of ethnic values, customs, and practices. A methodological approach that is cognisant of M&#257;ori knowledge and understandings was key to this research. So too was the Kaupapa M&#257;ori research paradigm that was employed alongside other relevant qualitative methodologies: feminist, case study, empowerment, narrative, and phenomenological approaches. Two main sets of conclusions emerge from Oho Mauri, both of which are drawn from the cultural values and cultural worldviews that T&#257;ngata Whai Ora/Motuhake hold. First, just as a secure cultural identity pays dividends in the recovery process, so can a cultural identity that has not been allowed to flourish increase the intensity of confusion and complexity that accompanies mental illness. Second, understanding mental illness has two dimensions: clinical; and personal. Whilst a diagnosis is a valuable clinical tool, understanding mental illness also requires recognition of the interpretations made by T&#257;ngata Whai Ora/Motuhake and the meanings they attach to their personal experiences. Often these provide alternative explanations and understandings of the experience of mental illness and are perceived as the most significant aid in a journey towards recovery. The findings in Oho Mauri do not claim that a secure cultural identity will necessarily protect against mental illness. They do demonstrate, however, that cultural identity is an important factor in the recovery process and that the recovery process itself can contribute to a secure cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori mental health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Men and manliness on the frontier: Queensland and British Columbia in the mid-nineteenth century</field><field name="creator">Hogg, Robert Paul</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Frontier and pioneer life -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Frontier and pioneer life -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Pioneers -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- Great Britain -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- British Columbia -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="subject">Masculinity -- Queensland -- History -- 19th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism destination development: Beyond Butler</field><field name="creator">Breakey, Noreen Maree</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">150604 Tourism Marketing</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Sunshine Coast.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The construction of whiteness in Australia: Discourses of immigration and national identity from the White Australia Policy to multiculturalism</field><field name="creator">Ganley, Nathan Tobias</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">White Australia policy -- History</field><field name="subject">Racism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- Government policy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism -- Australia -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical assessment of economic development, manufacturing and the political economy in Queensland, 1900 to 1930</field><field name="creator">Cameron, David Bruce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microbial ecology of equine laminitis of alimentary origin</field><field name="creator">Milinovich, Gabriel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equine, laminitis, hindgut, microbiology, microbial ecology, Streptococcus, oligofructose.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For reasons of governmentality: A genealogy of dividing practices in Queensland schooling</field><field name="creator">Meadmore, Daphne Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Queensland -- Entrance requirements.</field><field name="subject">Scholarships -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Widening horizons: The YWCA in Queensland 1888-1988</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Aline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Women -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social dynamics of lifecourse timing in historical perspective : transitions in an Australian rural community, Boonah, 1850-1978</field><field name="creator">Cole, John R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boonah (Qld.) -- Social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Christian Brothers in secondary education in Queensland, 1875-1965.</field><field name="creator">Connole, P.

Using data from 4904 Australian twins who completed a questionnaire on sexual attitudes and behaviours, I investigated the genetic and environmental influences underlying variation in and covariation between psychological and behavioural aspects of sexuality. Moreover, I explored the role of sexuality traits in several different contexts: evolution, mental health, public health, personality, and problematic behaviour. Before presenting reports of the four main empirical studies in this thesis, I make the case for the importance of studying human sexuality, outline previous findings on the etiology of individual differences in sexuality, and describe the behavioural genetic principles and techniques that were used in the investigations. I also present an additional fifth paper reporting a behavioural genetic analysis of EEG power, which I undertook in order to learn twin data modelling and complex multivariate techniques. In the first empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from an evolutionary perspective. As sexual orientation is genetically influenced, it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency. I tested the hypothesis that while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals&#8217; reproductive success, they may confer some advantage for heterosexuals who carry them. Results showed that psychologically masculine females and feminine men are 1) more likely to be nonheterosexual, but 2) when they are heterosexual have more opposite-sex sexual partners. Genetic modelling revealed that both these relationships are partly due to pleiotropic genetic influences common to each trait. Further, heterosexuals with a nonheterosexual twin had more opposite-sex partners than do heterosexual twin pairs. Taken together, these results suggest that genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could contribute to the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population. In the second empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from the perspective of mental health risk. Large epidemiological studies have shown that homosexuals are at much greater risk of psychiatric disorder than the general population. This has been assumed, with some supporting evidence, to be because of the prejudice and discrimination experienced by homosexuals in a heterosexist society. Here I tested the viability of alternative explanations, using Eysenck&#8217;s Neuroticism and Psychoticism scales as markers for psychiatric vulnerability. Firstly, I tested whether apparent sexual orientation differences in psychiatric vulnerability simply mirror sex differences &#8211; for our traits, this would predict nonheterosexual males having elevated Neuroticism scores as females do, and nonheterosexual females having elevated Psychoticism scores as males do. The results contradicted this idea, with nonheterosexual men and women scoring significantly higher on both Neuroticism and Psychoticism than their heterosexual counterparts, suggesting an overall elevation of psychiatric risk in nonheterosexuals. Secondly, I used the genetically informative sample to assess the viability of explanations invoking a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability. We found significant genetic correlations between sexual orientation and both Neuroticism and Psychoticism, but no corresponding environmental correlations, suggesting that if there is a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability it is likely to have a genetic basis rather than an environmental basis. The third empirical paper investigated the etiology of risky sexual behaviour, which is relevant to public health and welfare through its role in STD transmission and unwanted pregnancies. Results showed that variation in risky sexual behaviour is due to genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental influences to approximately equal degrees. The genetic influences partly overlapped with genetic influences on dispositional factors, with significant genetic correlations between risky sexual behaviour and Eysenck&#8217;s Impulsivity, Extraversion, Psychoticism, and Neuroticism. This suggests that the genetic influences that shape our personality may also predispose us to risky sexual behaviour. The fourth empirical paper investigated the etiology of a strong association (r = .50) between risky sexual behaviour and adolescent misconduct. Results indicated that the association is due to overlapping genetic and environmental influences, but that in males genes are the primary source of the association whereas in females shared environment plays the greater role. These findings suggest that a general predisposition to risky behaviour may manifest in different potentially harmful ways in adolescence (misconduct) and adulthood (risky sexual behaviour), and that different processes are involved in male and female etiology. Following the empirical reports, I provide a general discussion of my research findings and the study of human sexuality more generally. After summarising the findings and their implications, I then provide a detailed description of potential limitations of the research and to what extent they qualify the conclusions drawn. I also critically discuss the absence of sexuality traits from the major models of personality, and why this and other shortcomings make the personality models inadequate from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, I suggest directions for future research in light of the research and discussion presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual orientation</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">risky sexual behaviour</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cultural history of Brisbane 1940-1970</field><field name="creator">Hatherell, William</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature and society -- Queensland -- Brisbane -- History -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.) -- Intellectual life -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Brisbane (Qld.) -- Social life and customs -- 20th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honour denied: A study of soldier settlement in Queensland, 1916-1929</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Murray David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430101 History - Australian</field><field name="subject">780199 Other</field><field name="subject">Veterans -- Queensland -- Economic conditions.</field><field name="subject">Veterans -- Queensland -- Social conditions.</field><field name="subject">Veterans -- Employment -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Land settlement -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Agriculture -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eugenic ideology and racial fitness in Queensland, 1900-1950</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Emily Jane</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eugenics -- Queensland -- History -- 20th century.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organising and representing women's interests: A case study of a nurses' union</field><field name="creator">Elder, Ruth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321100 Nursing</field><field name="subject">Women labor union members -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Queensland Nurses' Union of Employees</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ghost of caution haunts House of Dunn: The rise and fall of a Queensland newspaper dynasty (1930-1989)</field><field name="creator">Kirkpatrick, Rod</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dunn family</field><field name="subject">Provincial Newspapers (Qld.)

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of teacher training in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Norman Reid</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers -- Training of -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For reasons of governmentality: A genealogy of dividing practices in Queensland schooling</field><field name="creator">Meadmore, Daphne Anne</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Education and state -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Queensland -- Entrance requirements.</field><field name="subject">Scholarships -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Widening horizons: The YWCA in Queensland 1888-1988</field><field name="creator">Gillespie, Aline</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Young Womens' Christian Association of Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Women -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social dynamics of lifecourse timing in historical perspective : transitions in an Australian rural community, Boonah, 1850-1978</field><field name="creator">Cole, John R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boonah (Qld.) -- Social life and customs</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Christian Brothers in secondary education in Queensland, 1875-1965.</field><field name="creator">Connole, P.

The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'What's wrong with being sexy?'

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FPGA-based asymmetric multiprocessor system-on-chip architecture and Linux operating system abstraction</field><field name="creator">Mr Xin Xie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lead Sulphide Nanocrystal Conjugated Polymer Bulk Hetero-junction Photovoltaics</field><field name="creator">Mr Andrew Watt</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Avian patch occupancy and landscape genetics of logrunners (Orthonyx temminckii) in fragmented subtropical rainforests of South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">David Charles Pavlacky Jr.</field><field name="description">The local extinction of habitat patches and dispersal between the patches are important processes structuring animal populations in heterogeneous environments. Understanding these two processes is crucial for the conservation of wildlife populations in landscapes impacted by human land-use. Approximately 50% of the subtropical rainforest in South East Queensland, Australia has been lost to deforestation over the last 100 years. While large areas of rainforest are reserved, little is known about the distribution and population status of rainforest birds within smaller remnants in the region. The overall research problem for this thesis was to understand how deforestation and fragmentation of subtropical rainforest affects the occurrence of rainforest birds and the effective dispersal of a rainforest-restricted species, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Understanding why some bird species are lost from habitat patches while others remain will lead to improved conservation of extinction prone species in fragmented landscapes. Although the mechanisms underlying local extinctions are well established in temperate systems, the relative importance of local and regional processes on species occurrence in subtropical and tropical rainforests is poorly understood. Chapter 2 investigated the relative effects of life history and scale of habitat modification on avian site occupancy using observational data collected at 46 rainforest sites in South East Queensland. A probabilistic model for the joint site occupancy of 29 bird species was used to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of avian life history traits on the occurrence of multiple species. The single-species occurrence models incorporated habitat effects on detection, which may be especially important in rainforests because dense vegetation and idiosyncratic occurrence of species can interfere with sampling. Occupancy rates for each species were modelled to determine the relative influence of process operating at the stand, landscape and patch scales. The life history analysis indicated taxonomic Family, body mass, migratory strategy and feeding strata had large effects on avian site occupancy, whereas abundance traits such as mean density and extent of occurrence showed little predictive ability. After accounting for correlated extinction risk attributed to life history, the degradation of stand structure at the local scale was more important for species richness than habitat modification at landscape or patch scales. While individual species showed various responses to the different scales of habitat modification, the distribution of many species was limited by vegetation structure at the landscape scale. Maintaining stand basal area and restoring degraded rainforests at the local scale will increase the probability of occupancy for members of the rainforest bird community. However, revegetation and retention of forest cover at the landscape scale may be necessary for the successful colonisation of many species. Chapter 3 introduced a predictive hypothesis-driven approach for quantifying the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. Current analytic frameworks in population genetics have difficulty evaluating meaningful hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. Confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes allowed the identification of dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. Two measures of indirect gene flow were estimated from microsatellite polymorphism among 11 logrunner populations. Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in a reconstructed historic landscape and a contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from non-independent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternate hypotheses. The historic and contemporary landscapes explained an equal proportion of variation in genetic differentiation and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. Migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. Landscape heterogeneity appeared to facilitate gene flow prior to European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal. Understanding asymmetric dispersal is becoming an important consideration for the conservation metapopulations. Populations acting as net exporters of dispersing animals may be able to rescue local populations from extinction and allow metapopulations to persist in degraded landscapes impacted by habitat loss. In Chapter 4, I estimated bidirectional migration rates from genetic data to infer dispersal among 11 logrunner populations. The first question posed was, does logrunner dispersal correspond to the source-sink or balanced model of dispersal? The second question involved determining the strength of evidence for two hypotheses about how landscape structure has affected asymmetric dispersal. Hypothesis one proposed that asymmetric dispersal was primarily influenced by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Hypothesis two asserted that asymmetric dispersal was predominantly influenced by anthropogenic landscape change. The data were confronted with the alternate hypotheses using linear mixed models and landscape covariates extracted from digital maps. The results showed the direction of asymmetric dispersal was consistent with source-sink population structure. I also discovered that the asymmetry in dispersal was influenced more by anthropogenic landscape change than by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Intact landscapes were net exporters of dispersing logrunners while landscapes heavily impacted by rainforest clearing were net importers of individuals. Elevated immigration rates into landscapes impacted by rainforest clearing appeared to arrest population declines in accordance with the rescue effect. The primary conclusion emerging from the study of patch occupancy and dispersal was that logrunner populations in South East Queensland conformed to a mainland-island metapopulation. Asymmetric dispersal from the largest expanse of upland rainforest appeared to prevent fragmented rainforests in close proximity from going locally extinct. While the distribution of logrunners was limited by the spatial configuration of rainforest patches, other rainforest birds exhibited variable responses to scale of habitat modification. The most consistent pattern was several species dropping-out of the community in degraded stands affected by selective timber harvest. Deforestation at the landscape scale also played a role in the extremely low patch occupancy rates of Albert&#8217;s lyrebirds (Menura alberti) and green catbirds (Ailuroedus crassirostris).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric dispersal, bird conservation, coalescent theory, forest fragmentation, gene flow, habitat loss, life history, migration, notophyll vine forest, species richness.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concept of an archipelagic state and its implementation in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Puspitawati, Dhiana</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of N-qubit chains</field><field name="creator">Mr Courtney Mewton</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of kunjin replicon vaccines</field><field name="creator">Ms Paweena Rattanasena</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Design of Free-Space Optical Interconnects for Optically Augmented Computing</field><field name="creator">Mr Feng-chuan Tsai</field><field name="description">Performance requirements of short-distance digital communication links have increased considerably with the escalating demand for high speed and high density data links. The high aggregate bandwidth and channel density achievable by free-space optical interconnects (FSOIs) make them ideal replacement for electrical interconnection schemes. Optical interconnects potentially have low power consumption, and can facilitate the development of radically novel designs for VLSI architectures including heterogeneous multiprocessor systems, and highly parallel computing systems. Recent developments in the integration of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) arrays and photodetector arrays with CMOS electronic circuitry have increased the practical potential of optical interconnects. However, VCSELs tend to operate in several transverse modes simultaneously, which will degrade the performance of FSOIs. Experimental investigation was performed to evaluate the operation characteristics and the intensity noise in VCSELs. The measurement results were later combined with optical simulations to analyse the effect of optical crosstalk in free-space optical interconnects. The VCSEL characterization included light-current-voltage relationships, relative intensity noise, modal spectral composition and modal beam profiles. The optical system simulation software (Code V) was used to simulate optical crosstalks in the FSOI system. Experimentally measured spectrally-resolved near-field images of VCSEL higher order modes were used as extended sources in the proposed simulation model. The simulation was performed using a combination of exact ray-tracing and the beam propagation method. A new type of crosstalk referred to as the stray-light crosstalk (SLC) was introduced. This type of crosstalk is caused by the overfill of the transmitter microlens by the VCSEL beam. It was discovered that part of the signal was imaged by the adjacent microlens to another channel, possibly far from the intended one. The simulation showed that the SLC is strongly dependent on the fill factor of the microlens, array pitch, and the channel density of the system. When comparing the diffraction-caused crosstalk (DCC) to SLC, an increase in the interconnection distance has little influence on the SLC. A simple behavioural model was developed which accurately approximates the crosstalk noise for a range of optical sources and interconnect configurations. The effect of transmitter and receiver array configurations on the performance of FSOIs was investigated. Our results demonstrate the importance of SLC in both square and hexagonal configuration. By changing the array lattice geometry from square to a hexagonal, we obtained an overall optical signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 3 dB. The optical SNR is optimal for the hexagonal channel arrangement regardless of the transverse mode structure of the VCSEL beam was shown. Furthermore, the VCSEL drive current required for the best performance of the FSOI system was determined. The optimal focal length of the transmitter microlens array which maximises the SNR by minimising the combined effects of DCC and SLC was determined. Our results show that shorter focal length needs to be used for higher order modes to obtain optimal SNR in an FSOI system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">optical interconnects</field><field name="subject">free-space optical interconnects</field><field name="subject">diffraction</field><field name="subject">optical crosstalk</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:166497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Rukmini-Krsna Bhakti Tradition in Maharashtra</field><field name="creator">Acharaya Kailashachandra Shastri</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The local bhakti tradition prevalent and popular in the state of Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra in India worships Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (Ru-K) as the divine couple. The divine couple R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the object of devotion of the greater Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava bhakti tradition has been the focus of several academic studies. Almost all scholarly publications and literature relating to the religious tradition of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a tend to focus on R&#257;dh&#257;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as the divine couple. In contrast, very little is published on Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a as a divine couple. My doctoral research examines the almost 700-year old Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition that is still very much alive today and that continues to thrive in the state of Mah&#257;r&#257;&#7779;&#7789;ra in India. The research has focused on centrality of Goddess Rukmi&#7751;&#299; in the tradition and its doctrine as revealed from the Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; devotional literature written by its poet-sants. I also study the devotional practices and profile of contemporary Ru-K tradition followers to establish how their understanding of the doctrine influences and shapes their personal practices. In particular, I explore the hypothesis that the Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition is a distinctive, syncretistic, and living devotional tradition that integrates Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava and &#346;aiva elements in its Marathi poet-sant literature as well as in its religious practice amongst its followers. Thus, in both theory and practice, the tradition caters to the needs and dispositions of followers from various social classes. My research methodology mainly comprised textual analysis Mar&#257;&#7789;h&#299; devotional literature written by the four major poet-sants of the Ru-K bhakti tradition. The research also involved a small component of field trip to study the contemporary followers and practices of the tradition. Research revealed that the followers of Rukmi&#7751;i-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition look upon Rukmi&#7751;&#299; as pure devotee of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a. The analysis of the hagiographies and local legends reveal Rukmi&#7751;&#299;&#8217;s role as a mediator and facilitator of meetings of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a with those who love him and are devoted to him. Acting as a mediator between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and his common devotees, she brought him out of his royal pastimes of Dv&#257;rak&#257; to Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura, albeit on the pretext of getting upset with him. Following K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a&#8217;s appearance in Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura, it has become the centre and springboard of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition. The Pa&#7751;&#7693;harapura pastimes of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a primarily involve personal loving exchanges between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a (as Vi&#7789;&#7789;hala) and his devotees from all walks of life. In these pastimes, Rukmi&#7751;&#299; plays the compassionate mediator between K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and his devotees, facilitating their meetings and exchanges. Therefore, Rukmi&#7751;&#299; is also looked upon by devotees as a kind and considerate mother. Analysis of the sant literature of the tradition revealed the dichotomous doctrinal stance of Advaitic (non dualistic) nirgu&#7751;a bhakti towards an impersonal Supreme taken by J&#241;&#257;ne&#347;vara and Ekan&#257;tha, and that of Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava (dualistic) sagu&#7751;a bhakti towards a personalised form of Supreme, taken by N&#257;madeva and Tuk&#257;r&#257;ma, co-existing under the umbrella of Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition. The reason for such a harmonious co-existence of mutually incompatible doctrines and flourishing of the tradition despite the incongruity is owing to the two common practices, singing the glories of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a and worshipping of personal form of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, both of which are considered to be of significance by both doctrines, albeit for different reasons and to achieve dissimilar objectives. Both practices have been instrumental in bringing together the followers and devotees with contrasting and incompatible doctrinal leanings. The case study of the contemporary devotees revealed a dichotomy, in the form of two different classes of devotees found within the tradition, one consisting of the non-elite rank and file devotees from rural and semi-urban regions displaying sagu&#7751;a bhakti practices and understanding, and the other consisting of devotees from the elite class taking an Advaitic nirgu&#7751;a stance. These classes continue to be maintained because the preachers, although Advaitic in their personal stance, tend to preach sagu&#7751;a bhakti to the masses, considering them to be insufficiently qualified for the advanced stage of Advaita. Consequently, the dichotomy perpetuates itself and is apparently harmonized through this bivalence on the part of preachers and common devotees. The unique aspect involving the fusion of &#346;aivism and Vai&#7779;&#7751;avism that one finds in the form of Hari-hara-aikya-bhava, sets the Rukmi&#7751;&#299;-K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a bhakti tradition distinctly apart from the greater Vai&#7779;&#7751;ava tradition, where such a fusion is not just absent, but rather clearly and consciously avoided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rukmini-krishna, vitthala, rukmini, marathi vaishnavism, varakari, panduranga, saguna bhakti, nirguna bhakti, marathi poet-sant, pandharpur.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical Simulation of a Hot Dry Rock Geothermal Reservoir in the Cooper Basin, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Muller</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the development and production of numerical simulations of the creation of a Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal reservoir. This geothermal reservoir that was simulated is owned by Geodynamics Limited and is located in the Cooper Basin, South Australia. The simulations show the geometry of the geothermal reservoir and predict the productive lifespan of the reservoir. Geothermal energy, which is the thermal energy that is stored in the interior of the earth, is an enormous energy source and as such there is great interest in technology that allows this energy to be harnessed. The HDR process of extracting the geothermal energy from rock involves drilling a borehole to a suitable depth and injecting cold water into the rock via this well (known as the injection well) to create a reservoir by opening up fractures in the rock. As water is forced through the reservoir, heat is extracted from the rock via conduction and transferred to the water, creating an heat exchange. Warm water is brought to the surface via another well known as the extraction well. The heat from the water is used to generate electricity and then the water is fed back into the injection well, completing the cycle. The creation of a HDR geothermal reservoir comprises of many aspects: the injection of the fluid into the jointed rock system, the opening and shearing of the joints, the creation of the fluid reservoir in the rock and the temperature effects of the fluid flow through the joints. This work incorporates all of these aspects. Due to the multi-physics nature of this process multiple computational modelling strategies were implemented to allow for authentic simulation of the entire process. The mechanical rock behaviour was primarily simulated the Distinct Element Method. This two dimensional Distinct Element Method program allowed for a realistically scaled model of the whole geothermal reservoir to be developed. This model was particularly useful for modelling the joint behaviour as the discrete nature of this method compares well with the joint system on such a scale. A discrete particle based model was used to model the joint behaviour on a small scale. These models demonstrated the behaviour of joints under compressional strain, showing slip and the effects of joint dilatancy. The productive lifespan of the geothermal reservoir was modelled using a Finite Element Method program based on Darcy's Law and an height-averaged heat equation. The aim of this model was to simulate the effects on the rock temperature of the fluid flow through the reservoir. The lifespan of the reservoir with differing well geometries was tested using this model to show which geometry would extend the productive lifetime of the geothermal reservoir. The results produced from the DEM models showed that the reservoir geometry is very much dependent upon the joint angle, and under the Cooper Basin stress regime steeper joints will be more likely to open. Joint dilatancy also affects the fluid flow rates as the amount of joint opening is dependent upon the joint dilatancy angle. The modelling of the temperature drawdown of the rock due to the fluid flow showed that a square configuration of wells is the ideal configuration to prolong the productive lifespan of the HDR geothermal reservoir. Results produced with the modelling parameters provided by Geodynamics Limited indicate that the productive lifespan of the Cooper Basin HDR geothermal reservoir created is approximately 50 years. This reservoir is only one of many that can be created at the site to prolong the productivity of the energy plant. The combined results of this modelling strategy give an overall image of the creation and lifetime of the HDR geothermal energy plant in the Cooper Basin.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">HDR</field><field name="subject">geothermal</field><field name="subject">Cooper Basin</field><field name="subject">Geodynamics</field><field name="subject">finite element</field><field name="subject">distinct element</field><field name="subject">Escript</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:173606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancing the Interhemispheric Switch Model of Perceptual Rivalry</field><field name="creator">Trung Thanh Ngo</field><field name="description">Perceptual rivalry refers to visual phenomena that are characterised by alternations between different percepts, despite an unchanging sensory input. Two common types of perceptual rivalry are (i) reversible figures &#8212; two-dimensional stable images that when viewed, are perceived to switch between different interpretations, and (ii) binocular rivalry &#8212; the alternations in image dominance resulting from the presentation of conflicting stimuli, one to each eye. Several investigators have suggested that these rivalling phenomena are mediated by similar neural mechanisms. Such a view, however, has not only been inadequately substantiated, but has also yet to be assessed in the context of a directly testable neurophysiological model. Miller and Pettigrew have proposed a novel, high-level interhemispheric switch (IHS) explanatory model of binocular rivalry. This model conceptualises the perceptual alternations as being mediated by alternations between one hemisphere&#8217;s selected image and the other hemisphere&#8217;s selected (rival) image. To assess their hypothesis, caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) was used. CVS is a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive brain stimulation technique that unilaterally activates high-level attentional areas. In accordance with the IHS model, CVS was found to significantly affect predominance (the duration that one image is perceived relative to the other, within a given viewing period) during conventional binocular rivalry with horizontal/vertical gratings and with orthogonal oblique gratings. The present thesis therefore aims, through the use of CVS, to extend this IHS model of binocular rivalry to reversible-figure alternations and propose a general IHS model of perceptual rivalry. Chapter 1 provides a detailed literature review of the field within the context of comparing both perceptual rivalries. In Chapter 2, investigations are presented on two different reversible figures &#8212; the perspective-reversing Necker cube and the figure&#8211;ground reversing Rubin&#8217;s vase&#8211;faces illusion. In these experiments, CVS was found to significantly change observers&#8217; predominance compared to their baseline predominance. These results demonstrate that interhemispheric switching also mediates the alternations of these visual phenomena, in addition to binocular rivalry, thereby extending the IHS model to one of perceptual rivalry in general. Moreover, the findings are interpreted in a cognitive neuroscience context, including a novel proposal of a forebrain framework for the IHS model. Chapter 3 presents CVS experiments that address the issue of percept&#8211;to&#8211;hemisphere selection and the reproducibility of CVS effects, following Miller&#8217;s initial work on two types of conventional binocular rivalry. In planned analyses, significant predominance changes were not found in horizontal/vertical rivalry, oblique rivalry and Necker-cube rivalry. In post-hoc analyses that accounted for study-design differences between Miller&#8217;s original experiments and the present experiment, CVS was again not shown to induce significant predominance changes in any of the rivalry types. Assessment of directional predominance changes following CVS appeared to suggest an arbitrary selection of percept&#8211;to&#8211;hemisphere in all rivalry types, although no firm conclusions could be drawn from the obtained data on this issue. Nevertheless, the experiments further extend upon Miller&#8217;s earlier work by examining the inter- and intra-individual reproducibility of CVS-induced effects on predominance. Such reproducibility was found to be low and potential reasons for this are discussed. The experiments in Chapter 4 examine a type of binocular rivalry in which dichoptic presentation of D&#237;az-Caneja stimuli yields rivalry among four different stable images: half-field rivalry between the images presented to the eyes, and coherence rivalry in which aspects of each eye&#8217;s presented image are perceptually regrouped into rivalling coherent images. Each of these rivalries was found to occur for about half the given viewing time. Furthermore, CVS significantly shifted the predominance of perceived coherent images (coherence rivalry) but not half-field images (eye rivalry). This finding suggests that coherence rivalry (like conventional rivalry according to previous experiments) is mediated by interhemispheric switching at a high level, while eye rivalry is mediated by intrahemispheric mechanisms, most likely at a low level. In addition, it is proposed that D&#237;az-Caneja stimuli induce &#8216;meta-rivalry&#8217; whereby these discrete high- and low-level competitive processes themselves rival for visual consciousness. The current thesis thus presents a novel meta-rivalry model of multistable binocular rivalry. It also presents the first direct evidence that interhemispheric switching mediates reversible-figure alternations, thereby supporting a generalised IHS model of perceptual rivalry. It is argued that both models provide a parsimonious exploratory framework within which specific predictions can be made and readily tested. Finally, the findings of all experiments in the current thesis are summarised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">reversible figures</field><field name="subject">perceptual rivalry</field><field name="subject">bottom&#8211;up versus top&#8211;down processing</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="subject">caloric vestibular stimulation</field><field name="subject">unilateral hemispheric activation</field><field name="subject">neural model</field><field name="subject">interhemispheric switching</field><field name="subject">percept-to-hemisphere attentional selection</field><field name="subject">meta-rivalry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:174117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making a Mark: negotiations in the commoditisation of authenticity and value at an Aboriginal art dealership</field><field name="creator">Barbara Ashford</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of processes of the dealership regarding Aboriginal art and artists. I take the approach that the art dealership is situated at a nexus of relationships that contest and negotiate culturally informed values and categories of fine art, Aboriginality and commodities. I argue that dealers in Aboriginal art mediate categories of value through their particular practices of representation of the art and through the social relationships they foster with artists and buyers. Therefore, through the relationships formed in the exchange process, dealers both make and mark culture. In this study I acknowledge the agency of Aboriginal artists but approach the process of negotiation of cultural categories from the perspective of the non-Indigenous audience for which the art is intended. The research is specifically concentrated on a particular dealership, Fire-Works gallery in Brisbane. I begin with the premise that buyers are drawn to Aboriginal art for more than aesthetic reasons and that objects and artists&#8217; cultural identities carry high value especially if judged authentically Aboriginal in the current art market. Both the art and the artists are made and marked as commodities in the art market; and while notions of authenticity are central to value, value is itself shifting and authenticity unstable. To establish the tensions and shifts in culture formation, I outline the historical biography of the acceptance of Aboriginal objects as fine art and the genesis of Fire-Works gallery within this socio-cultural and political milieu. In the latter chapters of the thesis I examine social relationships and situated practices chosen by the dealership to facilitate sales through the negotiation of valued cultural categories. The study provides an original examination of how shifting cultural categories are dynamically formed and reformed in the commoditisation of Aboriginal art by social agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">value, commoditisation, art, exchange, authenticity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coping with miscarriage: Australian women's experiences</field><field name="creator">Ingrid Rowlands</field><field name="description">This thesis combines quantitative and qualitative methods to examine both women&#8217;s psychological wellbeing after miscarriage and the specific coping strategies that are associated with coping well with this event. Chapter 1 reviews the ways in which miscarriage has been defined and its estimated prevalence. As definitions of miscarriage tend to vary across Western countries, the research implications of this are discussed. Chapter 2 reviews the literature related to women&#8217;s psychological responses following miscarriage, discussing the main outcomes which have been examined, including depression, anxiety, stress and grief. As the literature is relatively small, and current research is limited by small and non-representative samples, Chapter 3 takes an epidemiological approach by cross-sectionally investigating the psychological correlates, and relevant sociodemographic, reproductive and health-related variables associated with miscarriage using a large population sample of young Australian women. Sociodemographic and reproductive variables most strongly predicted membership of the Miscarriage and No Miscarriage groups, while psychological wellbeing did not distinguish the two groups in the stepwise logistic regression. Using the same data but applying longitudinal methods, Chapter 4 examined whether trajectories of Mental Health, Stress and Optimism varied over time and according to women&#8217;s miscarriage status. Relevant sociodemographic and reproductive variables identified in Chapter 3 as possible confounding variables were controlled in these analyses. Miscarriage was found to affect trajectories of Mental Health, Stress and Optimism, with poorer outcomes on all variables for women reporting miscarriage by comparison to women who had never miscarried over a seven-year period. Because miscarriage has significant effects on women&#8217;s mental health and wellbeing, the next part of the thesis was dedicated to examining the predictors of, and coping strategies related to, coping well after miscarriage. Since the term coping well is not easily defined, Chapter 5 is a critical review of the theoretical frameworks of coping, with an emphasis on identifying the conceptualisation and measurement problems which have limited advancements in the field. Chapter 6 is a review of the psychological, reproductive and sociodemographic predictors of adjustment to miscarriage, highlighting the conflicting evidence and the need for multivariate methods when analysing these relationships. Using the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#8217;s Health data, Chapter 7 uses longitudinal methods to investigate predictors of Mental Health among young women reporting miscarriage. Optimism, social support and the number of miscarriages were strong predictors of Mental Health among women reporting miscarriage. Chapter 8 is a review of the research which has examined the coping styles and strategies that women use to cope with miscarriage. The majority of this research tends to be of a qualitative nature, and therefore the next step was to complete interviews with nine women to gain a more in-depth understanding of the specific coping strategies related to positive outcomes after miscarriage. Social support was reported as facilitating adjustment to miscarriage, consistent with the quantitative analyses. Acknowledgement and support from health professionals was also described as facilitating adjustment. While the quantitative analyses had also initially suggested that satisfaction with the general practitioner was an important predictor of adjustment, this variable did not reach significance when other reproductive and psychological variables were controlled for. Taking all the results into consideration, it appears that changes to social norms and attitudes regarding miscarriage may help women to cope with this challenging and distressing experience. Interventions to help women cope with miscarriage need to be grounded in an understanding of women&#8217;s need for social and family support, and understanding from health professionals.

Despite a long history of phosphine use, little is known about either the mode of action of this compound or the mechanisms whereby insect pests have become resistant. To better understand phosphine toxicity and resistance mechanisms, a genetically well-characterised model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used in my PhD project. Three previously created phosphine resistant C. elegans mutants (pre-1, pre-7 and pre-33) developed from the wild type N2 strain were used in this study, though analysis of pre-33 was the primary focus. The three mutants were determined to be 2, 5 and 9 times more resistant toward phosphine than was the parental N2 strain by comparison of LC50 values. Molecular oxygen was shown to be an extremely effective synergist with phosphine as, under hyperoxic conditions, 100% mortality was observed in wild-type nematodes exposed to 0.1 mg/l phosphine, a non-lethal concentration in air. All three mutants were resistant to the synergistic effects of oxygen in proportion to their resistance to phosphine with one mutant, pre-33, showing complete resistance to this synergism. I take the proportionality of cross-resistance between phosphine and the synergistic effect of oxygen to imply that all three mutants circumvent a mechanism of phosphine toxicity that is directly coupled to oxygen metabolism. Compared with the wild-type strain, each of the three mutants has an extended average life expectancy of 12.5 to 25.3%. This is consistent with the proposed involvement of oxidative stress in both phosphine toxicity and ageing. Indeed, a correlation between phosphine resistance and resistance to other stressors (e.g. heavy metal, heat and UV) was also detected. On the other hand, no significant difference in methyl viologen sensitivity was found between pre-33 and N2 strains, suggesting that pre-33 mutant does not seem to provide resistance to phosphine via protection against oxidative damage. Additionally, to test for possible involvement of the DAF-2/DAF-16 signalling pathway in the phosphine response, the levels of phosphine sensitivity of mutants in this pathway were tested. Phosphine resistance levels were increased in daf-2 and age-1 mutants but decreased in daf-16 nematodes, which mirrors the longevity phenotypes of these mutants, suggesting some congruence in glucose signalling between the phosphine resistance and longevity traits. In contrast, no congruence is observed between phosphine resistance and oxidative metabolism as the clk-mutation, which disrupts oxidative metabolism does not cause phosphine resistance and neither do the phosphine resistant mutants cause the severe developmental delay of the clk-1 mutation. The phosphine induced time-dependent mortality was assessed in both N2 and pre-33 nematodes at two fixed phosphine concentrations (0.3 and 3.0 mg/l), allowing the determination of minimum exposure periods required for any mortality as well as the exposure time required to achieve 50% mortality. As a result, it was determined that 15 hours of exposure was needed for significant mortality in N2 and pre-33 strain when exposed to 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, respectively; whereas this period is 5 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l phosphine. The fact that the LT50 value for N2 at 0.3 mg/l phosphine is indistinguishable from that of pre-33 at 3.0 mg/l (24.6 and 24.5 respectively) suggests that 0.3 and 3.0 mg/l of phosphine have the same toxic effects on N2 and pre-33 nematodes respectively. This result is consistent with the finding that pre-33 is ~9 fold more resistant to phosphine than is the N2 strain. Moreover, the LT50 was determined to be 8.4 hours for N2 when treated with 3.0 mg/l of phosphine, which is only three times faster than pre-33 when exposed to the same level of phosphine. In contrast to the differential toxicity of phosphine between the N2 and pre-33 lines, the delay in reaching reproductive maturity caused by phosphine exposure is indistinguishable between WT and pre-33 nematodes. This indicates that the phosphine induced delay in maturation is independent of the toxic effects of phosphine. Since the inhibition of complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) in the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been proposed as a mechanism of phosphine toxicity, the phosphine effects on cellular ATP metabolism, presented as ATP+ADP content and ATP/ADP ratio, were also assessed. Phosphine exposure (0.3 mg/l, 25 hours) led to a significant decrease in ATP+ADP levels as well as the ATP/ADP ratio in N2 nematodes. Similar results were also detected in pre-33 nematodes when exposed to 3.0 mg/l phosphine for 25 hours. These observations indicate that phosphine can interrupt cellular ATP metabolism, which is associated with phosphine induced mortality. Additionally, the fact that mutant pre-33 can maintain its ATP levels under phosphine exposure at 0.3 mg/l suggests it has a greater ability to maintain mitochondrial function than does the N2 strain. To better understand the mechanism of phosphine toxicity in the wild type N2 strain, gene expression profiling by DNA microarray analysis was employed. A significant overlap between phosphine and DAF-16 regulated genes was detected, supporting the previous finding that the DAF-2/DAF-16 pathway can contribute to phosphine resistance. Phosphine exposure also strongly induced xenobiotic detoxification and stress responses, indicating nematodes are able to sense phosphine induced toxic effects and protect themselves by switching on native detoxification mechanisms. Furthermore, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were also up-regulated by phosphine, possibly due to an increase in energy demand caused by increased xenobiotic detoxification activities. Consistent with the previous findings that phosphine delays median reproductive age and reduces fertility, expressions of a large number of genes involved in growth, embryonic development and reproduction were suppressed by phosphine. Moreover, the microarray results of seven genes whose expression levels were significantly altered by phosphine were validated using RT-PCR, confirming the robustness of the microarray results. The most direct way to determine the phosphine resistance mechanism in mutant pre-33 is to identify and characterise the mutation itself. Using a classic F1 test, the resistance mutation in pre-33 was determined to be incompletely recessive. Additionally, using three mapping strategies, the resistance mutation was mapped to Chromosome IV between 12,591,683 and 12,879,637 bp with 45 genes located in this small region. In an attempt to identify the resistance gene, the effect of suppressing each of 28 of the 45 genes in the interval was determined using a commercially available gene suppression library. It was observed that only knockdown of gene vha-7 resulted in a slight decrease in phosphine sensitivity (84.6%) compared to N2 (97.6%). However, this result does not clearly implicate vha-7 as the resistance gene in pre-33. The microarray results indicated that linoleate and arachidonate signalling pathways might be activated by phosphine. This was observed as induction of a phospholipase A2 gene that regulates the release of arachidonic acid from the C-2 position of membrane phospholipids, as well as several CYP genes predicted to catalyse the oxidation of linoleate and arachidonate. Therefore, phosphine effects on the linoleate and arachidonate dependent signalling pathways were assessed. It was found that, in the presence of phosphine, the pre-33 mutant has a greater ability to transform linoleate and arachidonate epoxides to diols than does N2. This activity may help pre-33 to better maintain mitochondrial function and, therefore, ATP metabolism than N2 during phosphine exposure. The microarray results also showed that phosphine exposure caused up-regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, indicating phosphine regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. As expected, a preliminary metabonomic analysis by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) into the effect of phosphine exposure on metabolism in N2 nematodes revealed significant alteration of the metabonomic profile.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oxidative Stress</field><field name="subject">Longevity</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Metabonomics</field><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">ATP metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">World War II Nominal Roll database: accurate record or true record?</field><field name="creator">William A. Park</field><field name="description">The Australian Government Internet database, the World War Two Nominal Roll, is problematised and then analysed as a document of patron-sponsored alternative journalism as described by Atton and Hamilton, because it attempts to fulfill functions previously completed in Australia by newspaper publishers and television producers. These functions &#8211; of discovering, establishing, editing, contextualizing, recording and publishing memory &#8211; have long been regarded as roles of journalism. Later they have been seen as roles also of literary publishing and documentary filmmaking, and most recently of online records management. They became especially evident in the 1990s, the decade of the 50th anniversary of many World War II events, during which many anniversary supplements were published in Australian newspapers and in television documentaries. Partly as a result of this major anniversary, the Australian Government undertook the tasks of discovering, establishing, editing, recording, contextualizing, and publishing World War II military memories as an online database known as the World War Two Nominal Roll. The enactment of this large task required the engagement of a subcontractor who tendered on the basis of skills in records management, and the adoption of a methodology which offered some level of quality assurance of the outputs. The problematisation of this project suggests that the engagement of the subcontractor and the methodology adopted for the World War Two Nominal Roll are analogous to the engagement of professionalized journalists, and the adoption of recognised journalistic methods, for the publication of a media artifact such as an anniversary supplement. In that light, this thesis compares the error rates evident in the Nominal Roll with the literature of error rates in contemporary newspapers, and compares some of the audience effects of publishing the Nominal Roll with those of publishing newspapers. This involves a comprehensive examination and critique of the physical nature of the Roll and the processes of its production. The analysis in the first place suggests that the database Roll is overall more trustworthy than established journalism artifacts but in detail more susceptible to errors of fact and context and less likely to be corrected. This leads to the second assessment that the publication of the database Roll is less effective than newspapers as a means of memorialisation. Finally, the findings suggest that the processes deployed in the compilation of the database Roll would have benefitted from the adoption of aspects of ordinary journalistic routines not used by the database publishers. Reasons for this are proposed and discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400000 Journalism, Librarianship and Curatorial Studies</field><field name="subject">Records</field><field name="subject">Alternative journalism</field><field name="subject">Journalism</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Accuracy</field><field name="subject">World War 2 Nominal Roll Database</field><field name="subject">Veterans</field><field name="subject">Commemoration</field><field name="subject">Retention</field><field name="subject">Military recruitment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stories from the Hidden Heart of &#8220;sacred violence&#8221;: An exploration of violence and Christian faith in East Timor in dialogue with Ren&#233; Girard's mimetic insight</field><field name="creator">Joel Hodge</field><field name="description">This dissertation explores how Christian faith affected the hope and resistance of an oppressed people in their response to violence orchestrated against them. It undertakes this task through stories collected from the people of East Timor, a half-island nation located in South-East Asia that was brutally ruled by Indonesia from 1975 to 1999. The nature of Christian faith is a vexed question for the modern world particularly when this faith has grown in countries like East Timor where suffering, violence and oppression were inflicted on the people. This lack of understanding of the nature and development of Christian faith is evident in academic studies of East Timor. Moreover, the difficult nature of this question is compounded by the fact that the violence and oppression, such as that inflicted on the East Timorese, is often orchestrated by the nation-state, which itself is a creation of the modern West. Faith in these circumstances of violence is often explained away as a circumstantial reaction after which the people will return to the path of reason. Yet, this attitude is problematic in the way it juxtaposes reason and faith. It ultimately exposes an unsound anthropological understanding of the human person as well as a view of reason that is narrow and insufficient as it sees reason as unable to cope with the circumstances of violence. This dissertation argues for an understanding of faith and violence through an analysis of the experiences of the East Timorese. This analysis is undertaken from an anthropological and theological understanding of the human person, primarily based on the insights of Ren&#233; Girard which provide clarity in understanding the relationship between human being, reason and faith. This dissertation argues that Christian faith helped the East Timorese people confront the existential and anthropological challenges posed by violence, and so, enabled them to overcome the illusions and false transcendence of violence, which Girard (1977, 31) says &#8220;&#8230;is the heart and secret soul of the sacred&#8221;. The dissertation shows that Christian faith helped form purpose, hope and non-violent resistance to state-sanctioned violence in East Timor through the anthropological, existential and imaginative resources fostered in relationship with Christ. The dissertation proposes an explanation of the experiences of the East Timorese recounted in this dissertation that posits that relationship with and faith in Christ, as the self-giving and victimised &#8220;Other&#8221;, had a discernible and plausible effect on the East Timorese particularly in the circumstances of violence. This faith commitment seemed to change and free persons and cultural structures in East Timor from the violent transcendence imposed by the dictatorial state that presents itself as &#8220;sacred&#8221;. This freedom emerged as the oppressed and victimised East Timorese, through their experience of the violent depths of human relations, were directed toward the pacific transcendence located around the victim, Christ, the substance of which is Christ&#8217;s self-giving love originating from and shared with the Father through the Spirit. East Timorese people were directed and responded to Christ in faith as they encountered the self-giving mimesis of the Trinity sacramentally and through the martyrs. This faith formed a new ontological way, or direction, which fostered resistance to the sacred violence of the state and their supporters. Through the enactment of their faith in this new and pacific way of being in self-giving mimesis, the Christian community in East Timor sought to resist and transform the state into a more benign and responsive entity by exposing and removing its ability to arbitrarily and indiscriminately victimise and oppress. This ecclesiological stance sought to expose the truth in the midst of the lies of sacred violence through a pacific way of being that was learnt from communion with the risen Christ as self-giving victim.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Girard</field><field name="subject">East Timor</field><field name="subject">Christian faith</field><field name="subject">Mimetic theory</field><field name="subject">theology</field><field name="subject">anthropology</field><field name="subject">violence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bacterial Aggregation and Biofilm Formation by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli</field><field name="creator">Yanwen Cheryl-lynn Ong</field><field name="description">Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is one of the most common nosocomial infections and is caused by a range of different uropathogens, particularly by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Amongst the different virulence factors, biofilm formation and bacterial aggregation, often mediated by cell surface structures such as fimbriae, are common traits among uropathogens that cause CAUTI. In this study, a collection of UPEC isolates were screened for virulence genes and phenotypes associated with urinary tract infections such as biofilm formation and mannose-sensitive haemagglutination. Two strains, E. coli MS2027 (which formed a strong biofilm) and E. coli M184 (which aggregated strongly) were analysed in detail to determine the molecular mechanisms associated with these phenotypes. Transposon mutagenesis of E. coli MS2027 identified type 3 fimbriae as the factor responsible for its strong biofilm growth. Further screening revealed the presence of type 3 fimbriae in uropathogenic Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter koseri, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae and other E. coli. Phylogenetic analysis of the type 3 fimbrial (mrkABCD) genes from these strains revealed they clustered into five distinct clades (A-E) ranging from one to twenty-three members. The majority of the sequences grouped in clade A, which was represented by the mrk gene cluster from the genome sequenced K. pneumoniae strain MGH78578. We demonstrated that type 3 fimbriae are functionally expressed by different Gram negative nosocomial pathogens and present evidence to suggest that they contribute significantly to catheter colonisation. The type 3 fimbrial genes from E. coli MS2027 were found to be located on a conjugative plasmid. Sequencing and annotation revealed that this 42,644 bp plasmid, named pMAS2027, contains 58 putative genes. Bioinformatic analysis identified pMAS2027 as an incompatibility X (IncX1) plasmid. Plasmid pMAS2027 contained genes encoding two important virulence factors, type 3 fimbriae and a type IV secretion (T4S) system. The biofilm ability was solely based on the expression of type 3 fimbriae and not the T4S system. The T4S system, however, accounted for the conjugative ability of pMAS2027. Differential tagging with fluorescent reporter genes demonstrated conjugative transfer of pMAS2027 between cells during biofilm growth. Finaly, transposon mutagenesis of E. coli M184 revealed a number of putative genes potentially responsible for bacterial aggregation. Of these, genes involved in the synthesis of the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) were shown to be associated with an aggregation phenotype.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UPEC</field><field name="subject">CAUTI</field><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Type 3 fimbriae</field><field name="subject">Aggregation</field><field name="subject">Conjugation</field><field name="subject">Escherichia coli</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178812</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation in Older Adults: Personal Competence Factors and Social Vulnerability</field><field name="creator">Donna Pinsker</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Exploitation of older people can result in devastating emotional and financial consequences. Researchers and policy makers have widely recognised the deleterious effects of exploitation on older adults, particularly cognitively impaired older people. Studies to date have provided basic information about the demographic and health characteristics that contribute to exploitation in later life, namely extreme dependence, frailty, social isolation, severe physical illness, and cognitive impairment. However, an overarching explanatory framework of vulnerability, and clinical instruments to aid with identifying those individuals at elevated risk of exploitation a priori have been lacking. Furthermore, the specific cognitive and social factors at the level of the individual which promote vulnerability to exploitation remain largely unexplored. The present research was directed towards addressing these issues. For definitional purposes, the term social vulnerability is used throughout in reference to an individual&#8217;s degree of susceptibility to exploitation. Exploitation of older people can take many forms including social and sexual exploitation, mistreatment, and deprivation of rights. Financial exploitation in particular is a relatively widespread phenomenon among older people, and may be a salient marker of social vulnerability in later life. In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, literature relevant to financial exploitation and social vulnerability more generally among older people is reviewed, and a conceptual framework for describing and explaining heightened vulnerability is presented. Central to this framework are various factors of personal competence at the level of the individual (i.e., intelligence, cognitive functioning, social intelligence, social skill, personality traits) which, in theoretical terms, contribute to, or protect against, exploitation. Chapter 2 details the development and psychometric evaluation of a standardised scale for assessing social vulnerability among older adults (termed the SVS15). Given that financial exploitation may be a pertinent marker of social vulnerability in older people, item content for the scale includes items of a financial nature. The results of two studies provided support for the reliability (internal consistency) and validity (known-groups) of the SVS15. Results of a factor analysis revealed a two-factor solution, with the emerging factors labelled gullibility and credulity. Stability in factor structure of the SVS15 was established in an independent sample using structural equation modelling. Chapters 3 and 4 of the dissertation detail the methodology employed in, and results of, a series of three studies systematically investigating the relationships between personal competence factors and social vulnerability in older people. Using multiple regression analyses, non-significant associations between basic demographic characteristics and social vulnerability were found in a nonclinical older sample, indicating that heightened vulnerability to exploitation is not readily explained by age, gender, or education. Rather, general cognitive functioning emerged as the most significant correlate of SVS15 scores in a combined clinical and nonclinical sample of older adults such that poorer cognitive functioning was associated with greater vulnerability to exploitation. Executive functioning in particular showed significant overlap with SVS15 scores after controlling for differences in memory and age. These results support the inclusion of standardised neuropsychological tests of memory and executive functioning (tests which are routinely used) when issues of social vulnerability arise. After general cognitive functioning, social measures of self-awareness and social skill were also important correlates of social vulnerability scores, indicating that social measures could also contribute useful information when assessing social vulnerability in older people. From an applied perspective, Chapter 5 of the thesis presents normative data for the SVS15, and an examination of the Tclinical utility of the scale using individual case studies of older adults diagnosed with a dementia syndrome. In Chapter 6, an amalgamation of the results from the project is presented, and the theoretical and clinical contributions of the findings are highlighted. TThe findings contribute to the extant literature in two ways: (1) through the development of aT potentially useful and psychometrically sound instrument which targets symptoms of social Tvulnerability more directly than existing neuropsychological measures and (2) by enhancing the current understanding of the cognitive and social personal competence factors associated with heightened vulnerability in later life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">social vulnerability</field><field name="subject">financial exploitation</field><field name="subject">dementia</field><field name="subject">memory</field><field name="subject">cognitive functioning</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of post-translational modification sites in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor</field><field name="creator">Keyur Dave</field><field name="description">The dioxin receptor (DR), a transcription factor with basic-helix-loop-helix/PERARNTSIM (bHLH/PAS) homology domains, is activated by toxic xenobiotic ligands leading to severe physiological disturbances most of which are due to deregulation of receptor&#8217;s central role in normal development. Activation mechanisms of DR in the presence of exogenous or endogenous ligands are poorly understood. Elucidation of factors involved in the activation of the receptor would assist not only in development of an optimal measure for risk assessment of levels of common environmental pollutants but also in providing novel targets for therapeutic interventions. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) play an indispensable role in all major signal transduction pathways by increasing the inventory of chemical modifications beyond those already present in the side-chains of common amino acids. Thus, by simple on/off or complex patterns generated by these PTMs, they control a myriad of different biological outcomes. Numerous studies that have suggested an important role of posttranslational modifications in DR activation has prompted a search in this direction, however, apart from phosphorylations at Ser36 and Ser68 no other PTM sites are known. Advanced mass spectrometry (MS)-based characterisation of PTMs is an established technique that can comprehensively provide an accurate cast of all PTM variants and their locations on a protein. This thesis reports the first MS-based comprehensive characterisation of all PTM sites of the purified latent DR and preliminary analysis of identified PTM sites of the activated DR in response to developmental signals (suspension-activated DR) and signals leading to toxic outcomes (ligand-activated DR). The PTM map of the latent DR revealed from this study comprises of 25 phosphorylations, 4 monomethyl-lysines, 2 dimethyl-lysines, 1 O-acetyl-serine and 2 O-sulfono-serines. Most of the phosphorylations and other PTMs were present in the conserved regions of the protein. Investigation of the activated samples of the receptor revealed loss of the above repertoire of modifications and possible presence of some rarer modifications such as O-acetyl-serines in suspension-activated instead of O-sulfonations and pyrophosphorylation at Ser716 in both suspension- as well as ligand-activated DR. A comprehensive mutagenesis study is in progress to understand the functional consequence of each of these modification sites and unravel the functional posttranslational system in DR signalling.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mass spectrometry, phosphorylation, dioxin receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, proteomics, sulfonation, dimethylation, post-translational modifications</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Control of Finite Dimensional Quantum Systems</field><field name="creator">Paulo Marques Furtado de Mendonca</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the problem of developing a quantum counter-part of the well established classical theory of control. We dwell on the fundamental fact that quantum states are generally not perfectly distinguishable, and quantum measurements typically introduce noise in the system being measured. Because of these, it is generally not clear whether the central concept of the classical control theory --- that of observing the system and then applying feedback --- is always useful in the quantum setting. We center our investigations around the problem of transforming the state of a quantum system into a given target state, when the system can be prepared in different ways, and the target state depends on the choice of preparation. We call this the "quantum tracking problem" and show how it can be formulated as an optimization problem that can be approached both numerically and analytically. This problem provides a simple route to the characterization of the quantum trade-off between information gain and disturbance, and is seen to have several applications in quantum information. In order to characterize the optimality of our tracking procedures, some figure-of-merit has to be specified. Naturally, distance measures for quantum states are the ideal candidates for this purpose. We investigated several possibilities, and found that there is usually a compromise between physically motivated and mathematically tractable measures. We also introduce an alternative to the Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity for mixed quantum states, which besides reproducing a number of properties of the standard fidelity, is especially attractive because it is simpler to compute. We employ some ideas of convex analysis to construct optimal control schemes analytically. In particular, we obtain analytic forms of optimal controllers for stabilizing and tracking any pair of states of a single-qubit. In the case of stabilization, we find that feedback control is always useful, but because of the trade-off between information gain and disturbance, somewhat different from the type of feedback performed in classical systems. In the case of tracking, we find that feedback is not always useful, meaning that depending on the choice of states one wants to achieve, it may be better not to introduce any noise by the application of quantum measurements. We also demonstrate that our optimal controllers are immediately applicable in several quantum information applications such as state-dependent cloning, purification, stabilization, and discrimination. In all of these cases, we were able to recover and extend previously known optimal strategies and performances. Finally we show how optimal single-step control schemes can be concatenated to provide multi-step strategies that usually over-perform optimal control protocols based on a single interaction between the controller and the system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum control</field><field name="subject">state transformation</field><field name="subject">quantum channels</field><field name="subject">distance measures</field><field name="subject">semidefinite programming</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of an internet-based treatment for childhood anxiety (BRAVE for Children-ONLINE): An evaluation of efficacy and factors associated with treatment outcome</field><field name="creator">Sonja March</field><field name="description">The efficacy of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in the treatment of child anxiety disorders has been well established in the literature, with on average, just over 50% of children becoming free of their primary anxiety diagnosis immediately following treatment (James et al., 2008). Despite the existence of these efficacious treatments, up to two thirds of children with anxiety do not receive assistance for their difficulties (Essau et al., 2002). The reasons for this are varied, and include lack of available therapists or services, long waiting lists, high therapy costs and stigma associated with therapy. Computer- and internet-based interventions represent a modern alternative for delivering CBT interventions that may be more appealing and accessible to a greater proportion of children with anxiety. Various forms of computer-assisted therapies have been investigated, including palmtop computers, desktop computers, virtual reality and online programs. Although computerised interventions have demonstrated promise in the treatment of adult anxiety, they have only recently received interest in the child literature. Specifically, there are very few controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of computer- and internet-based interventions for childhood psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders. The present research involved the initial development and subsequent testing of an entirely internet-based, CBT intervention for child anxiety disorders. BRAVE-ONLINE was developed as an internet adaptation of The BRAVE Program, a clinic-based program which has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of childhood anxiety. The online intervention is a therapist-mediated program, in which children and parents receive email and telephone assistance from a therapist throughout treatment. BRAVE-ONLINE is an interactive program consisting of 10 child and 6 parent sessions to be completed by families in their own home. Following the development of BRAVE&#8211;ONLINE, the first study of this thesis included a randomised control trial to investigate the efficacy of the internet-based intervention (NET) compared to a waitlist control (WL). Seventy-three children aged between 7 and 12 years, diagnosed with separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder or specific phobia were randomly allocated to NET and WL conditions. Treatment effects were evaluated at 10-14 weeks post-assessment and 6-month follow-up, using multiple outcome measures including a diagnostic interview, clinician ratings of severity, parent and child questionnaires. Results indicated that at post-assessment, 30% of NET participants in the completer sample (22.5% in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) sample) no longer met criteria for their primary anxiety diagnosis, compared to 10% of WL participants. Significant gains were also evident for clinician severity ratings, global assessments of functioning, and several questionnaire measures. However, results also indicated that children and parents were slow to progress through therapy, such that a large proportion of families had not completed all treatment sessions at the post-assessment point. For this reason, 6-month follow-up may present a better indication of treatment efficacy. Indeed, at 6-month follow-up, treatment gains were improved upon such that 75% of children in the completer sample (52.5% in the ITT sample) no longer met criteria for their primary anxiety disorder. Reductions in severity ratings, global assessments of functioning and child and parent self-report measures were also improved upon at 6-month follow-up. Further, the online intervention was found to be highly acceptable to families and was associated with only minimal rates of attrition. The second study of this thesis aimed to explore factors associated with treatment outcome for the online intervention. Factors of interest included demographic factors (age, gender, income and educational background), treatment expectancy, initial symptom severity, program compliance and pre-treatment diagnostic comorbidity. Specifically, this study investigated the extent to which each of these factors predicted the improvement made by children on global assessments of functioning (CGAS) at 6-month follow-up. Results indicated that only some of these factors were directly associated with treatment outcome. Although treatment expectancy predicted compliance with the program, it was not associated with treatment outcome. Baseline severity also did not predict treatment outcome. Contrary to expectation, levels of program compliance by children negatively predicted outcome, such that children who were more compliant with the program showed fewer improvements in overall functioning. Parent compliance did not predict treatment outcome. A significant relationship was evident between diagnostic comorbidity (number of pre-treatment anxiety diagnoses) and treatment outcome, such that higher baseline comorbidity predicted poorer functioning on the CGAS at 6-month follow-up. None of the demographic factors were associated with treatment outcome. Overall, the findings of this research suggest that a CBT intervention delivered entirely over the internet was associated with reductions in indicators of anxiety at post-assessment, compared to a WL control, particularly for the completer sample. Further, these reductions were improved upon at 6-month follow-up, with a substantial proportion of children becoming free of their primary anxiety diagnosis. The results also indicated that the online intervention might not be as effective for children suffering from multiple anxiety disorders. The effects of program compliance were somewhat surprising and possible explanations are offered. Although these results are promising, conclusions should be regarded as tentative until further trials are conducted and the online intervention is compared with clinic-based treatments. Limitations of this research and areas for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Child Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">Computer</field><field name="subject">Online Therapy</field><field name="subject">Randomized Controlled Trials</field><field name="subject">Predictors of treatment outcome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heparan sulphate releasing biomaterials for tissue engineering</field><field name="creator">Emma Luong-van</field><field name="description">Tissue repair is a complex process that is difficult to emulate. The addition of the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS), a multi-potential regulator of numerous growth factors and cytokines endogenously expressed during the repair process, may represent a valuable tool for tissue engineering. The addition of exogenous HS into wound site has previously been shown to promote tissue repair in a number of models, however, the incorporation of HS into controlled release systems or biomaterials for tissue engineering had not been explored prior to the work presented here. Thus, this thesis explores the incorporation of HS and its analogue heparin into synthetic biodegradable polymer biomaterials with different potential applications, either as a slow releasing drug reservoir, or as a drug releasing cell scaffold. Polycaprolactone was used to make microcapsules and electrospun fibers for HS or heparin entrapment. These materials were characterized for their drug release profiles, biocompatibility and bioactivity. Microcapsules encapsulating heparin or HS were made by the oil - in - water solvent evaporation method which allowed fabrication of slow releasing drug reservoirs. Either pure water or a poly(vinyl alcohol) solution was used in the drug phase which resulted in capsules with similar size and drug loading. However the internal morphology and drug release profiles showed differences depending on the drug phase, in either case release was sustained for over 30 days. These capsules elicited no pro-inflammatory response from macrophages in vitro, and the released HS retained its bioactivity to induce the proliferation of human mesenchymal stem cells, an important cell type for bone tissue engineering. Heparin and HS were incorporated into electrospun fibers as a drug releasing scaffold for two different tissue engineering applications. Heparin fibers were studied as a drug releasing membrane that could be used in vascular repair to prevent the unwanted proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Heparin release was sustained from the fibers for at least 2 weeks. The fibers did not induce a pro-inflammatory response from macrophages in vitro and the released heparin retained the ability to inhibit the proliferation in vascular smooth muscle cells. HS fibers were studied as a tissue engineering scaffold for bone repair using human mesenchymal stem cells. HS release was maintained for over 30 days which is thought to be an appropriate time for bone repair applications. The release profiles depended on the HS concentration in the spinning solution which affected the morphology of the fibers. The fibers did not elicit a pro-inflammatory response in cultured macrophages and supported the proliferation and mineralization of human mesechymal stem cells. The HS fibers were then taken through to an in vivo model to study ectopic bone formation of pre-osteoblast cells on HS releasing scaffolds. The fibers produced a chronic inflammatory response in vivo, which lead to the clearance of implanted cells and no mineralization of the scaffold. The HS and heparin materials made in this work showed sustained release over appropriate time frames for different tissue repair applications. The released HS and heparin maintained bioactivity and showed good biocompatibility in vitro, however, further in vivo studies are required to fully test their efficacy for tissue engineering.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Heparan sulphate</field><field name="subject">heparin</field><field name="subject">regenerative medicine</field><field name="subject">polycaprolactone</field><field name="subject">drug delivery</field><field name="subject">microencapsulation</field><field name="subject">electrospinning</field><field name="subject">bone repair</field><field name="subject">vascular repair</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the growth behaviour of epitaxial InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures using electron microscopy</field><field name="creator">Mohanchand Paladugu</field><field name="description">Materials in smaller scales exhibit promising properties that are useful for wide variety of applications. Semiconductor quantum wells and quantum dots are two main examples of low-dimensional systems, where the quantum wells act as two-dimensional systems and the quantum dots act as zero-dimensional systems. Alternatively, semiconductor nanowires act as one-dimensional materials, and they exhibit promising and device applicable properties. These nanowires are relatively new class of materials compared to the quantum wells and the quantum dots. The semiconductor nanowires are expected to be the building blocks for future nanoelectronic and nano-optoelectronic device technology. Vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism is a widely used mechanism for the growth of semiconductor nanowires, where metal nanoparticles are used as the catalysts for the nanowires growth. This growth mechanism offers a flexibility to control the size, morphology and location of the semiconductor nanowires. In the VLS growth, changing the chemical composition of vapor constituents produce consequent compositional modulation in each nanowire. The compositional modulation along the nanowire axis produces axial nanowire heterostructures and in radial direction produces radial nanowire heterostructures. Such compositional modulation within an individual nanowire enables the designing of band structure of a nanowire and thereby allows the fabrication of single nanowire devices. These nanowire heterostructures show many potential properties and consequent applications. Although the semiconductor nanowire heterostructures are promising semiconductor nanostructures, the fundamental growth mechanisms of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures have not been explored sufficiently due to their complex nature of the growth. In this regard, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues associated with axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. For such fundamental investigations, this PhD work chooses InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system due to its potential applications. In fact, InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are the first reported axial nanowire heterostructure system. However, no detailed investigations were reported on this system so far. The detailed nucleation and growth mechanisms associated with InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system are explored in this thesis using electron microscopy investigations. This objective is achieved in the following steps. &#8226; InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are grown using Au nanoparticles and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method. To determine the axial and radial growth evolution of InAs on GaAs nanowires, different InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are produced by depositing InAs for different durations on GaAs nanowires. The GaAs nanowires are initially grown for 30 min and then the InAs is deposited on these nanowires for 1, 3, 5 and 30 min. &#8226; These InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations. These investigations determine that, in the initial stages of the InAs axial growth (1 min), the Au particles move sidewards and subsequently downwards by maintaining an interface with the GaAs nanowire. Such a movement of Au catalysts is attributed to lower Au/GaAs interfacial energy than Au/InAs. The detailed TEM investigations show that this Au movement depends upon the crystallographic nature of the GaAs nanowire. The Au particle is always tend to move towards {112}B sidewall of the GaAs nanowire rather than its {112}A sidewalls. Increase in InAs growth duration shows that InAs branches evolve from GaAs-InAs core-shell structures. Such evolution is observed in following steps: (1) the movement of Au particle terminates when it encounters the radially grown InAs on GaAs nanowires; (2) further growth of InAs leads to the InAs nanowire growth from those terminated Au nanoparticles in the form of branches. &#8226; The TEM observations of InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures show that, in the initial stages of InAs radial growth on GaAs nanowires, InAs nucleates preferentially in the concave regions of the non-planar sidewalls of the GaAs nanowire. The further growth of InAs leads to the preferential formation of InAs shell structure at the regions of concave regions. Such heterogeneous formation of shell structure resembles InAs nanoring structures around GaAs nanowire cores. InAs growth on the planar {112} sidewalls of GaAs nanowires with hexagonal cross sections shows different growth phenomena to the above described InAs nanorings formation. In this case, InAs preferentially nucleates on {112}A sidewalls of the GaAs nanowires and with further deposition of InAs, the complete shell structure of InAs form with {110} sidewalls on the GaAs nanowire cores. &#8226; In addition to the above mentioned investigations, to observe the growth evolution of GaAs on InAs nanowires, GaAs is grown for 3 and 30 min on InAs nanowires. The TEM investigations of these nanostructures show that the axial GaAs/InAs hetero-interface contains an InGaAs transition segment in contrast to the sharp InAs/GaAs (InAs on GaAs) hetero-interface. The different nature of hetero-interfaces is attributed to the different affinities between Au catalysts and Ga or In. The radial growth of GaAs on InAs nanowires show that the GaAs shell has grown in wurtzite structure around the wurtzite structured InAs nanowire cores. Overall, through the extensive SEM and TEM investigations, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues related to the growth of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. Such fundamental investigations are expected to advance the processing and application prospective of the semiconductor nanowires and their associated heterostructures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanowires, nanostructures, heterostructures, nucleation and growth, self-assembly of matter, vapor liquid solid mechanism, materials science, nanotechnology, transmission electron microscopy, crystal growth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric Dependence Structures</field><field name="creator">Anthony Hatherley</field><field name="description">Asymmetric dependence (AD) is defined as dependence that differs across opposing regions of the joint return distribution. Recent evidence of AD between equity returns suggests that dependence can be decomposed into a linear component, captured by the correlation matrix, and a higher order component. When these higher order terms are characterised by increased correlation in bear or bull markets, the effectiveness of diversification strategies is reduced. To the extent that an investor is unable to completely diversify these higher order terms of dependence, it follows that they should be reflected in asset prices and managed explicitly during the portfolio construction process. The aim of this thesis is to determine the extent of AD amongst asset returns, to investigate whether AD is priced and to develop a means of managing AD in the portfolio. I justify the existence of AD and the separation of AD from linear dependence via the bivariate Edgeworth expansion, finding that the joint return distribution may be described by an infinite number of higher order co-moments. Correlation (and hence &#946;) describes one dimension of an infinite number of higher dimensions describing dependence. To determine the importance of AD in finance, I first develop measures that can detect AD independent of the level of linear dependence and idiosyncratic risk. These measures are used to determine the extent of AD amongst US stock returns and the market, to obtain an understanding of how AD changes through time and to re-examine the evidence of AD between equity portfolios. By measuring AD separate from linear dependence, I demonstrate several findings. First, I find evidence of non-stationary AD that can exists irrespective of the magnitude of linear dependence, measured by &#946;. This time-varying AD consists of both significant upper tail dependence (UTD) and significant lower tail dependence (LTD), although LTD is found to occur more frequently than UTD, especially for small stocks and stocks displaying high idiosyncratic risk. Significant time-varying AD is also detected between domestic equity indices and international equity markets, implying that if a portfolio is weighted towards certain industries or countries, portfolio construction methods may need to be adjusted in order too meet risk and return targets, particularly if future AD cannot be adequately forecasted. Next, I investigate whether AD is priced in US equities using the Fama and MacBeth (1973) regression methodology in conjunction with my &#946; invariant AD metrics. I find that AD is as important as linear dependence in explaining the variation in returns. In particular, a positive relationship between LTD and return is found. I document an AD risk premium of 2.7% pa, compared to a &#946; risk premium of 6.18% pa. The AD risk premium increases to 6.9% pa for stocks with significant LTD. This result holds after controlling for size, book-to-market ratio, downside &#946; and coskewness. I also find past AD is a significant variable in predicting the future returns of small firms, whilst neither AD nor linear dependence predict the future returns of large firms. I subsequently demonstrate a means of incorporating AD structures during the portfolio construction process using copula functions. I then investigate how asymmetric return dependencies affect the efficient frontier and subsequent portfolio performance under a dynamic rebalancing framework. By considering the problem of tactically allocating a small set of domestic equity indices, I demonstrate several findings. First, I show that a Mean-Variance efficient frontier differs from the efficient frontier constructed under AD. Constructing paper portfolios based upon these differences, I find that real economic value lies in correctly accounting for AD structures. The primary source of this economic value stems from the ability to better protect portfolio value and reduce the size of any erosion in return relative to the normal portfolio. Finally, I document the benefits of actively managing AD during the portfolio construction process and determine a number of portfolio management principles required to successfully manage AD. I illustrate that managing asymmetry risk in a portfolio of international equity indices results in increased return, decreased risk and decreased transaction costs. I show that in order to yield these benefits, investors must actively and dynamically manage their portfolio. Furthermore, I illustrate that the ability to short-sell assets provides most of the benefits described.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asymmetric dependence</field><field name="subject">correlation</field><field name="subject">asset pricing</field><field name="subject">portfolio theory</field><field name="subject">copula theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Sex Specific Cell Cycle Regulation in Fetal Germ Cells</field><field name="creator">Cassy Spiller</field><field name="description">During development, somatic cell cues direct sex-specific differentiation of germ cells that is characterised by two distinct cell cycle states. At 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) in a testis, XY germ cells stop proliferating and enter G1/G0 arrest. In the ovary, XX germ cells bypass G1/G0 arrest and instead enter the first phase of meiosis I from 13.5 dpc. Whilst it is hypothesised that errors in cell cycle control during development precede the formation of testicular germ cell tumours, the mechanism of cell cycle control at this time has not been thoroughly investigated. This project therefore sought to explore the mechanism of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest using several approaches. Although cell cycle regulation for somatic cells is well established, we know very little regarding germ cell control of this process. Therefore my first aim was to profile this machinery at the transcript level using a cell cycle cDNA array. Purified populations of germ cells were isolated both before and after sex differentiation and expression of 112 cell cycle related genes was assessed. From this study a comprehensive network governing apoptosis and calcium signalling that was common to both XX and XY germ cells was observed. Importantly, the retinoblastoma family and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was implicated in the regulation of G1/G0 arrest in XY germ cells. Lastly, XX germ cells displayed a down-regulation of genes involved in both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle consistent with their progression past G1 phase. This study has provided a detailed analysis of cell cycle gene expression during fetal germ cell development and identified candidate factors for future investigation in order to understand cases of aberrant cell cycle control in these specialised cells. In order to investigate several candidate genes identified within the cell cycle array, I next sought to generate a germ cell-specific Cre recombinase mouse model for use in conditional knockout studies. As current Cre lines lack specificity or appropriate temporal expression, we used the germ cell-specific regions of the fragilis promoter to drive Cre expression during germ cell specification. Eleven founder lines were generated using this construct and four were analysed using a reporter line. Although we have not achieved germ cell expression from these lines to date, analysis continues in order to identify an invaluable new tool for germ cell research. Following the implication of the retinoblastoma family in XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest, I next investigated the role of RB in these cells using the Rb null mutant. RB is a known cell cycle suppressor that controls this process in many cell types and, subsequently, mice homozygous for the Rb deletion die in utero at 14.5 dpc. Using this model we analysed developing gonads from 14.5 &#8211; 16.5 dpc using ex vivo culture techniques. At 14.5 dpc when wild type germ cells have arrested, proliferating germ cells were detected in the absence of Rb using proliferation marker Ki67. This proliferation was accompanied by a slight increase in germ cell number at 14.5 dpc, however, two days later at 16.5 dpc germ cell numbers were slightly decreased in the Rb-/- testes. During this time we could also detect increased expression of other RB family members p107 and p130, suggesting that these factors may compensate for the loss of Rb in the germ line. This investigation has implicated RB in the regulation of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest and will form the basis for future work aimed at understanding the initiation of this cell cycle state. In addition to RB, a lesser-known transcription factor was also investigated in the initiation and maintenance of XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest. The high mobility group box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) suppresses proliferation and promotes differentiation in various cell types and was recently identified within the XY germ cells at the appropriate time of sex differentiation. In my analysis two Hbp1 transcripts were identified within the XY germ cells that display different sub-cellular localisations in vitro. Next, Hbp1-LacZ reporter lines were generated to aid in understanding the germ cell-specific regulation of these transcripts and lastly, I analysed the genetrap mutation for Hbp1. Surprisingly, this model revealed no aberrations to germ cell-cell cycle control during development. In summary, I have performed the first comprehensive study of the cell cycle machinery utilised by germ cells as they undergo the first stages of sex differentiation. Using loss-of-function models I was able to implicate the cell cycle regulator RB specifically in XY germ cell G1/G0 arrest and, conversely, demonstrate that the transcription factor HBP1 is not required for this process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fetal germ cell</field><field name="subject">cell cycle regulation</field><field name="subject">gonad</field><field name="subject">mitotic arrest</field><field name="subject">meiosis</field><field name="subject">testis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; Employee Knowledge Sharing on Knowledge Management Systems: Normative and Social Exchange Perspectives</field><field name="creator">Scott Krebs</field><field name="description">Capturing and sharing individual and organisational knowledge is vital for organisational functioning. Knowledge management systems (KMS) are information technology systems which enable employees to electronically capture and distribute knowledge across the organisation. Because knowledge sharing is often a discretionary behaviour requiring time and energy on behalf of employees, the success of KMS largely relies on their motivation and willingness to share. KMS implemented within organisations have been largely ineffective with failure rates of 80% documented in the knowledge management literature. There is a need for further understanding of the barriers and facilitators for employee contributions to KMS. In particular, there is a dearth of empirical research examining the role of social and organisational factors in knowledge sharing on KMS. To this end, a programme of research was developed which utilised normative and social exchange perspectives to explain employee knowledge sharing on KMS. A combination of research methodologies were employed across five field-based studies. The aim of Study 1 was to identify the determinants of knowledge sharing on KMS. In Study 1, qualitative data were collected through 16 in-depth interviews with employees from a medium-sized private sector organisation. While several barriers and facilitators were identified, the most prevalent themes to emerge from the content analysis were perceived benefits and management support, highlighting the central role of social exchange and normative processes in explaining employee knowledge sharing on KMS. The results of Study 1 were used in conjunction with previous research to design the subsequent quantitative studies. Study 2 examined the mediating role of perceived benefits in the management support &#8211; knowledge sharing intentions relationship. It used a cross-sectional survey design and sampled 41 employees from a large private sector organisation. Three main findings emerged. First, management support was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Second, perceived benefits were positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Third, perceived individual benefits mediated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing intentions. Study 3 examined the moderating role of perceived organisational support (POS) in the management support &#8211; knowledge sharing intentions relationship. Study 2 and 3 were both quantitative studies taken from the same organisational setting but with different user groups. In Study 2, the users directly contributed their knowledge onto the system. In Study 3 (N = 45), the users shared their knowledge through an intermediary person. Study 3 further extended Study 2 by investigating knowledge sharing behaviour (N = 27) in addition to knowledge sharing intentions. Study 3 had three key findings. First, consistent with Study 2, management support was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions. Second, POS was positively related to employees&#8217; knowledge sharing intentions and knowledge sharing behaviour. Third, POS moderated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing behaviour. Study 4 replicated and extended the findings of the previous studies in a different organisational setting. Two separate studies were conducted in a medium-sized public sector organisation. In Study 4a (N = 295) data were collected at a single point in time. Study 4b (N = 246) extended the previous quantitative studies by examining two forms of management support for the KMS as well as collecting self-reported behavioural data (N= 130) at a second time period. Overall, the findings of these studies provided mixed support for the predictions. First, system-related management support, organisational identification, perceived individual benefit and perceived organisational benefit were directly related to employee knowledge sharing on KMS. However, contrary to prediction, POS was not found to be directly related to employee knowledge sharing across the two studies. Second, organisational identification was found to moderate the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing in Study 4a but not 4b. Third, POS moderated the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing in Study 4b, however, no such relationship was found in Study 4a. Finally, across the two studies, both perceived individual and organisational benefit were found to uniquely mediate the relationship between management support and knowledge sharing intentions. On the basis of the findings of the research programme, several conclusions were made. First, system-related support from management is an important determinant of employee knowledge sharing on KMS. Second, employees&#8217; perception of the benefits derived from knowledge sharing has an important influence on their contributions to KMS. Third, the extent to which employees identify with the organisation influences their decision to share knowledge on KMS. Fourth, the extent to which employees perceive support from the organisation influences their decision to share knowledge on KMS.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge Sharing, Social Exchange, Norms, Knowledge Management Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CONSUMER EVALUATIONS OF SPONSOR BRAND ASSOCIATIONS</field><field name="creator">Pi-Hsuan Monica Chien</field><field name="description">Corporate sponsorships have received increased attention from brand managers and academics in recent years. While researchers agree that sponsorship aids in generating favourable images for the sponsor, both at the corporate and brand levels, a lack of theory-guided models has prevented investigation into more complex phenomena. Current understanding of sponsorship effects is largely confined to the single sponsorship context with dominant emphasis on sponsorship awareness. The challenge surrounding sponsorship image measurement is only heightened by the increase in sponsorship activities. A growing number of brands are becoming associated with multiple events or entities. The purpose of the present research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie consumer processing of a brand&#8217;s sponsorship portfolio to affect inferences about sponsor brand associations, and in particular brand personality, brand meaning and brand attitude. The present research consolidates a range of conceptual and theory-guided models used by previous researchers, and adds to sponsorship literature by outlining how an accessibility based model can be applied to explain the cognitive processes involved when consumers encounter a brand&#8217;s sponsorships sequentially. In the context of a sponsorship portfolio, the associative network memory theory, congruence theory, and accessibility-diagnosticity theory are considered collectively and integrated into a conceptual framework to guide the development of hypotheses. The general theory proposed here is that accessibility of a sponsorship episode determines whether it will be used in subsequent information processing and percolate through to sponsor evaluations. A three-experiment research program is developed to explore the dynamics behind the portfolio effects. Pretests are conducted to identify brands and sponsorship properties that conform to the experimental manipulations but also to control for extraneous variables. Experiment 1 is designed to investigate the impact of perceived sponsorship portfolio fit on sponsor brand associations, and to determine how consumers assess portfolio fit. The experiment employs a 2 (sponsorship category relatedness: related vs. unrelated) x 2 (event personality fit: high fit vs. low fit) x 2 (sponsor product category: apparel vs. watch) between-subjects factorial design. Results point to sponsorship category relatedness as an important reference point in the evaluation of portfolio fit because it pulls sponsorships together when event personality fit is low, showing the predominance of category-based mode of processing. The role of event personality fit emerges when sponsorships lack categorical relatedness, leading to piecemeal-mode processing. Its influence of event personality fit is largely mute when sponsorships are categorically related, possibly because the individual event concepts are overwhelmed by a superordinate categorical imagery. Experiment 2 is designed to (1) allow replication of the portfolio effects with an additional sponsor product and different sets of sponsorship portfolios, and (2) investigate how individuals respond to a sponsorship portfolio which contains sponsorship properties with conflicting categories and personalities. Specifically, Experiment 2 aims to determine whether one sponsorship &#8220;frames&#8221; the processing of another sponsorship in a portfolio, and if so, determines the direction of framing. The experiment employs a 2 (sponsorship presentation sequence: sports first vs. cause first) x 2 (visual cues: present vs. absent) x 3 (sponsor product replicates: apparel vs. watch vs. juice) mixed factorial design. Two key findings emerge from this experiment. First, inferences about the sponsor brands&#8217; personalities are made in an additive fashion by augmenting event personalities, conforming to the &#8220;entitativity&#8221; principle. Second, when a sports sponsorship (rather than a cause sponsorship) is presented first in a portfolio, conceptual fluency is enhanced. This is because the sequence of processing is consistent with the way that people naturally think, thus leading to greater processing fluency. Experiment 3 is developed to further test the sponsorship framing effect and to explore the role of articulation in forging a relationship for ostensibly unrelated sponsorships. The experiment uses a 2 (sponsorship frame: sports frame vs. cause frame) x 2 (articulation: present vs. absent) between-subjects factorial design, plus a replicate and two control groups. Results replicate the findings of previous experiment where inferences for the sponsor brand personality are determined in an additive fashion. The findings also provide insights into when and whether using articulation in sponsorship communications can be beneficial. While articulating the relationship between sponsorships increases the perceived brand meaning consistency and clarity, a boomerang effect on brand attitude is observed, possibly because the commercially oriented content attributes a sales-oriented motive to the sponsor, which in turn, leads to a less favourable brand attitude. Theoretically, this research adds to current understanding of consumer-focused sponsorship processing by moving beyond simple pairing of sponsor and event, to consider the relationship between sponsorship properties. Through the integration of accessibility-diagnosticity theory, this research demonstrates that the way sponsorships influence brand evaluations is likely to be more complex than suggested by the existing literature and contributes to the development of methods to measure image transfer process. Practically, this research assists managers who are interested in the formulation of sponsorship policy and strategic design of sponsorship portfolios. The conceptual model developed in this thesis offers useful guidelines in providing input into the decision-making process when considering whether sponsorships could be used as brand building tools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sponsorship, brand associations, marketing, consumer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Board in Firm Strategy: A Strategy as Practice View</field><field name="creator">Kevin Hendry</field><field name="description">In this thesis I investigate how boards of directors strategize, how they manage strategy and how context affects this role. The significance of this research is underscored by three points. First, while there is an extensive body of literature on the board&#8217;s role in strategy, our understanding of how boards address this role, particularly how boards interact with management on strategy, is limited. Second, there is an implicit, albeit largely unproven, assumption in the literature that board involvement in strategy leads to more effective organizational performance. Third, there is a significant concern, especially from a practitioner perspective, that boards are overly focused on aspects of compliance at the expense of strategy and hence, underemphasize their role in driving firm performance. I begin with a review of the relevant literature on the strategy role of boards, using this literature to inform and reframe the broad research question that initiated this thesis &#8211; how do boards of directors contribute to strategy? In synthesizing this literature, I argue that it has not adequately addressed actual board behaviour in strategy and the impact of context on this behaviour. With this argument in mind, I frame board involvement in strategy from a Strategy as Practice perspective. I define board level strategizing as the situated (context dependent), socially accomplished flow of activities that characterizes how boards manage strategy, alternatively expressed as how boards &#8216;do&#8217; strategy. I use this Strategy as Practice perspective to reframe and refine the original research question. I follow the literature review with a discussion of the philosophical and methodological basis for this thesis, outlining an exploratory research program focused primarily on qualitative inquiry and supported by quantitative inquiry. In the qualitative stage I follow an inductive process that involves the pragmatic use of Grounded Theory Method. My specific objective is to develop a rich understanding of the practices that characterize board level strategizing and how these practices are affected by contextual aspects of the firm&#8217;s internal and external environments. I draw on pre-existing ideas from the Strategy as Practice literature on corporate level strategizing practices &#8211; Procedural and Interactive Strategizing &#8211; and use these as the starting point for an investigation into the strategizing practices of boards of directors. This stage involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with all directors and senior managers (47 in total) in six purposively chosen organizations. It also involves in-depth interviews with another 17 senior managers in 15 different organizations. viii In the quantitative stage I rely on survey research. My specific objectives are to both simplify and enhance the understanding of board level strategizing developed in the qualitative stage. In simplifying understanding I aim to develop concise constructs that adequately capture board level strategizing; in enhancing understanding I aim to develop multiple item indicators for each construct that address its complexity. This stage involves three phases: a pre-test, a pilot survey in one Australian state and a national survey. In operationalizing constructs, I integrate key points from the literature with the detailed description of board level strategizing that emerges from the qualitative stage. Data analysis involves the use of Exploratory Factor Analysis in the Pilot study and Confirmatory Factor Analysis in the National study. The qualitative findings indicate that boards engage in a context specific balance between Procedural and Interactive Strategizing. The former involves an administrative, formalized and hierarchical focus while the latter involves an interpretative and reciprocal focus, one that emphasizes face-to-face interaction between directors and management. While Procedural Strategizing involves the board responding to management&#8217;s interpretation of strategy, Interactive Strategizing involves each group arguing for their own interpretations of strategy before reaching collective agreement based on these interpretations. The qualitative findings also indicate that Procedural and Interactive Strategizing are opposite but complementary practices and that the balance between these practices is affected by the interaction between three contextual aspects: (1) the strategic stance of the board; (2) board power relative to management; and (3) the perceived legitimacy of each practice on the part of the organizational actors involved. In elaborating this balance between Procedural and Interactive Strategizing I develop a new theoretical perspective to describe board involvement in strategy. The quantitative findings identify the specific micro-activities that comprise Procedural and Interactive Strategizing. I argue that this thesis makes three significant and interrelated contributions to knowledge. First, it develops a board specific strategizing framework and language, one that advances current concepts in the literature. Second, it represents the initial steps in developing an explanatory theory of board strategizing, one that focuses on the underlying, context specific, practices that constitute boards &#8216;doing&#8217; strategy. Third, it develops a preliminary scale to measure this strategizing behaviour. Finally, I discuss the implications of this thesis for further research and for practice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">Strategy, boards, directors, governance, strategizing, practice, behaviour, context.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of a targeted exercise program on function, activity and participation of young people with cystic fibrosis: Using the ICF model as a basis for design</field><field name="creator">Allison Mandrusiak</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model (World Health Organisation, 2001) to explore the multidimensional presentation of strengths and problems in young people with cystic fibrosis (CF), firstly examining its theoretical &#8220;fit&#8221; to the health condition, and secondly using it to characterise the performance of those with CF. Few studies in the literature demonstrate such an holistic approach to the physiotherapy assessment and management of this population. It was expected that this description of performance would provide a framework for identifying key areas for physiotherapy exercise intervention. This then formed the basis for further studies to examine the effect of a targeted exercise program (compared to current exercise practice) on inpatient outcomes, as well as on outcomes of outpatient management. The position paper included provides theoretical support for the ICF model as an appropriate tool in the management of young people with CF. Building on this, Study 1 explored the practical utility of the ICF model for describing the presentation of young inpatients and outpatients with CF. Eighty-four participants with CF were recruited as a consecutive series who satisfied selection criteria to provide a cross-sectional view at younger (7-12 years, n=51) and older (13-17 years, n=33) ages. Musculoskeletal, respiratory and physiological measures represented the body structures and functions domain, the six-minute walk test and jump tests were included in the activities domain, and participation was described by the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire&#8211;Revised Version and Fels Physical Activity Questionnaire. Contextual factors were also considered (age, gender, inpatient/outpatient status). In this exploratory study, performance of this population was compared to normative data where available. Also, correlations between measures within and between ICF domains were examined as suggested by the model itself. Finally, effects of contextual factors on performance were investigated using univariate analysis of variance. This first study and the position paper support the ICF model as an effective tool for describing performance of young people with CF, and for investigating functional relationships within and between domains. Results showed significant differences in this population compared to normative data, and interrelationships were identified within and between ICF domains. Between inpatients and outpatients in the specified age groups, there was a statistically significant difference in means for a number of measures, whereby inpatients displayed consistently poorer mean scores than outpatients, with this effect significantly stronger in the older age group. The application of the ICF model was useful for highlighting areas to target in physiotherapy exercise intervention, and for substantiating selected measures to assess the program&#8217;s effectiveness across domains. Study 2 was a randomised controlled trial with blinded assessor, which investigated the effectiveness of a 10-14 day inpatient-based exercise program (the Cystic Fibrosis: Fitness Challenge) (CF:FC) tailored for young people with CF (7-17 years). The CF:FC program (n=15) included exercise strategies based on recommendations from previous work in the field, and from findings from Study 1. This program included a portable exercise package (FitKitTM) designed to be adaptable to limited space environments such as at the hospital bedside, important when inpatients with CF are isolated according to infection control procedures. Participants in the control program (n=16) received the current exercise practice provided for young people with CF at a tertiary hospital, which included mainly aerobic-type activities to affect airway clearance. Performance on study measures (scoped within the framework of the ICF model, presented in Study 1) were compared pre- and post-intervention (admission and completion of the inpatient exercise program) between the groups. This trial showed significant improvements for participants in both groups from admission to discharge for a range of measures, including respiratory function, muscle strength and quality of life measures. Participants in the intervention group showed significantly greater improvements for some measures, for example: ankle dorsiflexor strength, six-minute walk distance and perception of their respiratory status. The continuation of the intervention and control programs into the outpatient setting was the focus of Study 3. The FitKitTM was provided for the intervention group, incorporating strategies to enhance adherence including a physical activity log (PAL) and internet-based follow-up. The control home exercise program consisted of the current practice provided on discharge. Interestingly, the control group improved significantly in hip abductor strength and six-minute walk distance during the outpatient period, whereas the intervention group sustained the improvements gained in the inpatient period but generally showed no further significant improvement. When the change from inpatient admission to outpatient follow-up was considered, it was apparent that greater improvements during the inpatient period provided a &#8216;buffer&#8217; to accommodate for possible deteriorations in function in the outpatient phase. Issues regarding adherence to exercise programs during the outpatient period are discussed. This thesis confirms the usefulness of the ICF model for describing young people with CF, guiding assessment and review processes to achieve comprehensive management, and strengthening the evidence-base for targeted physiotherapy exercise intervention. A novel, tailored exercise program is introduced which is effective during inpatient periods, and provides a maintenance effect during outpatient periods, but strategies to enhance adherence during outpatient periods require further investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cystic Fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">ICF model</field><field name="subject">Randomised controlled trial</field><field name="subject">Inpatient</field><field name="subject">Outpatient</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183778</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration as Transnational Leisure: The Japanese in South-East Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jun Nagatomo</field><field name="description">In the 1990s, the bubble of the Japanese miracle economy burst and the country fell into recession. Following this, Japan experienced considerable economic and social transformation, including a reconsideration of its approach to work and employment. Among the consequences of these changes, such as unprecedented mobility in the labour market and an increase in part-time employment, there was a shift in lifestyle values, particularly those of middle class Japanese. In contrast to the traditional Japanese work ethic and company-orientated lifestyle which prized collectivism and self-sacrifice, new lifestyle values were largely centred on attaining an improved life-work balance which was less structured and more &#8216;Western.&#8217; These new individualised lifestyle values began to be reflected in a new-found interest in leisure, characterised by a shift from group-oriented leisure activities to more individualised and personalised ones. There has been another very significant change of great relevance to this thesis: an increased and unprecedented interest in overseas tourism and migration. This thesis discusses an intriguing new dynamic between the transformation of the economy and the Japanese engagement with tourism and migration. Until the 1990s, due to the guaranteed lifetime employment and the prevalence of seniority systems of Japanese corporations, there was a relatively stable life model among Japan&#8217;s middle class. In addition to healthy demand in the domestic labour market and work-dominated lifestyle, stable work opportunities meant this group rarely considered pursuing individual tourism and migration. However, since the 1990s, increasing numbers of young middle class Japanese began to drift from the safe and assured life model and chose to live abroad. This thesis, based on qualitative methodology and in-depth interviews with 31 Japanese migrants to Queensland, is a study of Japanese lifestyle migration to Australia. It draws upon several important topics and theories in contemporary sociology including globalisation, transnationalism, migration and tourism. The complex linkages between these themes are an important characteristic of this thesis and are discussed in the literature review of Chapter 2. The methodological issues of this research are presented in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 contextualises lifestyle migration against the background of broader history of Japanese migration to Australia. The chapters that follow examine three key themes pertinent to exploring the interrelationship between social transformation in Japanese society in the 1990s, changing lifestyle values and migration to Australia. Chapter 5 considers the implications of social transformation of Japanese society, specifically focusing on the lifestyle value shifts as push factors in a broad sense. Chapter 6 explores the pull factors and focuses on motivations for migration to Australia. Chapter 7 examines the lives of Japanese lifestyle migrants in Australia and highlights a unique settlement process characterised by the lack of upward social mobility, the absence of geographical concentration of Japanese migrants and the impact this has on the formation of a sustainable ethnic community. Finally, Chapter 8 summarises the argument of this thesis and discusses its contribution to the field of sociology. Possible directions for future research are also outlined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">immigration</field><field name="subject">lifestyle migration</field><field name="subject">ethnic community</field><field name="subject">settlement</field><field name="subject">work</field><field name="subject">leisure</field><field name="subject">social transformation</field><field name="subject">Australian multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Japanese society</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:183953</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating Lapita subsistence and pottery use through microscopic residues on ceramics: methodological issues, feasibility and potential</field><field name="creator">Alison Crowther</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of experimental and archaeological investigations of microscopic plant residues on Lapita pottery from the western Pacific Islands. Lapita is a critical phase in the culture history of the Pacific region and has been associated with the development and spread of a subsistence system based on the cultivation of tropical starch crops, particularly those in the taro-yam complex. However, few archaeobotanical remains been recovered from Lapita sites to lend empirical support to this model. This study explores whether microscopic starch granules, calcium oxalate crystals and other plant microremains on Lapita potsherds can provide direct evidence for the preparation and consumption of staple plant foods, as well as important clues to the function and use of pottery in Lapita society, matters which remain the subject of some debate. This research was undertaken in two main phases. The first involved a series of technical studies aimed at developing methods for recovering and identifying starch and raphide residues on archaeological pottery. Changes to starch during cooking and charring under different heat and moisture conditions were examined to understand how granules survive differentially depending on cooking method and food type. Various methods used to extract native starch granules from charred residues were then tested and a procedure based on a weak oxidising treatment was developed for use on the archaeological residues. The reliability of calcium oxalate raphide analysis, which is much less developed than that of starch, was also critically assessed. Issues with previous identifications of raphides in Pacific microfossil assemblages were highlighted. Morphological criteria were presented for identifying aroid raphides more accurately and chemical tests were developed to differentiate them from naturally-occurring calcite crystals, which were abundant in the sites analysed. The second phase of research analysed microscopic residues on Lapita and post-Lapita potsherds from archaeological sites in the Mussau and Anir Islands (PNG), the Reef Islands (Solomon Islands), New Caledonia, and the Samoan Archipelago. Despite the generally small quantities of residue recovered from the archaeological samples, several sherds with possible use-related starch residues were identified. These initial results indicate that ceramic vessels, including both plain and dentate-decorated Lapita wares, were employed in a variety of tasks involving the cooking and/or consumption, and storage or preparation of starch-based foods. It was also found that these were among the activities performed at the &#8216;special purpose&#8217; stilt house structure at the ECA site, which raises questions about the possible social or ritual status of staple starch resources in Lapita society. One of the most significant findings to emerge from this study was of taro (Colocasia esculenta) starch granules on sherds from the ERA Lapita site (Anir, New Ireland), and granules identified tentatively as taro on sherds from RF-2 (Reef Islands) and Mulifanua (Samoa). A number of unidentified morphotypes were also present on the Lapita and post-Lapita sherds, suggesting that a variety of plants not among the key root crops were also exploited. These may include some of the many fruits and nuts attested in archaeobotanical assemblages from Pacific sites. The ceramic residue data complement starch and phytolith evidence recovered from cultural sediments from RF-2, which demonstrate the presence and probable exploitation of a suite of crop plants typically associated with the Lapita &#8216;economic package&#8217;. In addition to taro, these include at least one cultivated species of Eumusa banana, non-domesticated (seeded) Australimusa bananas, bamboo, and possibly also Canarium, coconut, and sago. These data support models suggesting that Lapita groups were cultivating and transporting subsistence plants, including at least one of the major root crop complexes, and associated knowledge of their production and preparation across the western Pacific from the mid-late Holocene. This study demonstrated that analyses of microscopic starch residues on archaeological ceramics from the Pacific region can yield significant insights into vessel use and plant exploitation. Further methodological refinements should aim to increase starch yields, which will enable stronger associations between residues and vessel uses to be established. Expansion of reference collections is also required so that more precise identifications of the specific plant foods involved can be achieved.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lapita</field><field name="subject">Pacific</field><field name="subject">subsistence</field><field name="subject">pottery</field><field name="subject">starch</field><field name="subject">raphides</field><field name="subject">cooking</field><field name="subject">residue</field><field name="subject">microscopy</field><field name="subject">archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical Modelling of the Plasma Membrane</field><field name="creator">Valeriu Dan Nicolau</field><field name="description">Many crucial cellular processes take place at the plasma membrane. The latter is a complex, two-dimensional medium exhibiting significant lateral structure. As a result, a number of non-classical processes, including anomalous diffusion, compartimentalisation and fractal kinetics take place at the membrane surface. The evaluation of various hypotheses and theories about the membrane is currently very difficult because no general modelling framework is available. In this thesis, we present a stochastic, spatially explicit Monte Carlo model for the plasma membrane that accounts for illmixedness, mobile lipid microdomains, fixed proteins, cytoskeletal fence structures and other interactions. We interrogate this model to obtain three classes of results, regarding (1) the effect of lipid microdomains on protein dynamics on the membrane (2) the effects of microdomains, cytoskeletal fences and fixed proteins on the nature of the (anomalous) diffusion on the membrane and (3) the effects of obstructed diffusion on reaction kinetics at the membrane. We find that the presence of lipid microdomains can lead to nonclassical phenomena such as increased collision rates and differences between long-range and short-range diffusion coefficients. Our results also suggest that experimental techniques measuring long-range diffusion may not be sufficiently discriminating and hence cannot be used to infer quantitative information about the presence and characteristics of microdomains. With regard to anomalous diffusion in particular, we find that to explain this phenomenon at the levels observed in vivo, a number of interactions are required, including (but not necessarily limited to) obstacle-induced diffusion and segregation, or exclusion from microdomains. The effects of these different interactions upon the nature of the diffusion appear to be approximately additive. Finally, we show that a widely used non-spatial method, the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, can be modified to take into account anomalous diffusion and that this significantly increases its predictive accuracy. The model presented in this thesis is expected to be of future value in evaluating different models of cell surface processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">membrane</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">lipid rafts</field><field name="subject">anomalous diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relatedness, host specificity and richness of the genus Ceratomyxa (Myxozoa: Myxosporea) in teleost fishes</field><field name="creator">Nicole Gunter</field><field name="description">The genus Ceratomyxa Th&#233;lohan, 1892 is one of the largest myxozoan genera, the species of which almost always infect the gall bladder of marine teleosts. Although there are over 180 species known globally, prior to this study only three had been described from Australia. This study explores the systematics, host specificity and species richness of Ceratomyxa species from a diverse range of Queensland marine fishes. The first part of this thesis deals with the issues associated with spore based taxonomy and incorporates the first molecular studies to investigate host specificity and radiation in three common families of Great Barrier Reef (GBR) fishes. Twenty-two new species were described in these chapters, and although they were superficially similar in morphology all were genetically distinct. A focus on Ceratomyxa spp. infecting labrid, pomacentrid and serranid fish revealed tight host specificity of parasite species, confirmed the presence of multiple parasite species in a single host and revealed that no parasite radiation had occurred that could be associated with co-evolution with host families. Exploration of intra- and inter-specific variation by sequencing of multiple replicates from host/parasite combinations allowed interpretation of species boundaries within the system. Ten additional species described in Chapter 5 supported the findings from the labrid, pomacentrid and serranid studies but broadened the host range studied. In total 32 Ceratomyxa species were described from Queensland fishes increasing the number of described species in the genus by 15%. This study also reports on undescribed species collected from a further 70 host species and broadens the known host range to seven families of fishes. A checklist of bivalvulidans from marine teleosts in Australia is compiled of described and undescribed species and highlights the abundance of Ceratomyxa relative to other gall bladder dwelling myxosporeans. A phylogeny of the Ceratomyxa based on SSU rDNA analyses explored the taxonomic integrity of the genus. In general, the morphological diagnostic characters that divide the Myxozoa into genera are not well supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses. The relationship between 42 Ceratomyxa spp. and 36 other marine myxosporeans was examined using Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. Results indicate Ceratomyxa is one of the most cohesive lineages within the Myxozoa and that the freshwater fish parasite, C. shasta, does not represent an independent lineage as suggested in previous studies. The strict host specificity of Ceratomyxa species prompted the investigation of species richness on the GBR. Species accumulation curves were used to explore species richness by using Choa2 and Jackknife1 estimators. The estimates suggested Ceratomyxa is almost as rich as their teleost hosts and that 1,600 species could be present on the GBR and as many as 15,000 species may exist globally. As an unexpected result, Ceratomyxa may be the richest metazoan genus in the sea. In light of what the study revealed, a revision of a second genus within the family Ceratomyxidae, Leptotheca, is presented. The boundaries between Ceratomyxa and Leptotheca were unclear. The diagnostic characters that separate these genera (length to thickness ratios) were found to be plastic and the type species of Leptotheca ultimately fitted the diagnosis for Ceratomyxa. To eliminate confusion between these genera and also between Sphaerospora and Leptotheca, the genus Leptotheca was considered invalid, with all species appropriately assigned to other genera based on morphological and biological characters and supported by genetic evidence.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Myxosporea</field><field name="subject">Ceratomyxa</field><field name="subject">Systematics</field><field name="subject">Host Specificity</field><field name="subject">Richness</field><field name="subject">SSU rDNA</field><field name="subject">phylogeny</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">Fishes</field><field name="subject">Parasitology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl without hands: extract from the manuscript of a novel. The Maiden without hands: from folktale and fairy ale to contemporary novel</field><field name="creator">Melissa Ashley</field><field name="description">The Girl without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel By Melissa Jane Ashley Abstract The major component of the thesis is an extract from the manuscript, The Girl without Hands, a novelised interpretation of the folktale and fairy tale, The Maiden without Hands. The novel is composed of three books, with point of view structured as shifting third person; most of the story is narrated by the central character, Marina Fischer. The manuscript deploys a variety of fairy tale and folktale related literary techniques, including magic realism, intertextuality, framing, and fantasy. Events span a period of eight years, the action set in rural and urban parts of Queensland and Victoria. On an unsupervised picnic with friends, fourteen year old Marina Fischer&#8217;s twin sister Sonia suffers a fatal head injury. Grief-stricken and self-blaming, Marina reacts to the trauma by losing all feeling and movement in her hands. Six months following the accident, Marina seems on the verge of recovery; she attends regular therapy and is protected by her loyal friends, siblings Amelia and Sammy Jones. However, the patina of stability begins to crack when Marina is confronted at the year ten formal by Sonia&#8217;s former associates, Kylie Bates and Jody Cutter, also present at her death. Distraught and upset, Marina flees the dance in Jody&#8217;s older brother&#8217;s car. Seven years later Marina meets Matt Soverign, a gifted hypnotist, who tries to help her regain movement in her hands. They sleep together and Marina unexpectedly falls pregnant. Their son Tristram is born while Matt attends an interstate conference. Thinking a child would help her hands to heal, Marina becomes depressed when she continues to suffer from paralysis. She begins to dwell on memories of her sexual assault the night of the school dance, slowly losing touch with reality. But a phone call from her estranged friend, Amelia Jones, shakes Marina out of her stasis. Her close mate Sammy, who now lives in Melbourne, has fallen dangerously ill. With her relationship in pieces, Marina purchases train tickets for herself and Tristram and embarks upon a spontaneous&#8212;though much delayed&#8212;journey to reconcile the past. The critical component of the thesis is an essay entitled &#8220;The Maiden without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel&#8221;. Chapter one, &#8220;The Tale is Not Beautiful if Nothing is Added to It,&#8221; is a literary survey of cross-cultural folktale and fairy tale variants of the 1200 year old narrative, The Maiden without Hands. I explore academic debate regarding the literary fairy tale&#8217;s indebtedness to the oral folktale, discussing Susan Stewart&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;distressed text&#8217; and Lewis Seifert&#8217;s theory of &#8216;nostalgic recuperation.&#8217; Chapter two, &#8220;Then the Devil Will Take Me Away,&#8221; undertakes a close reading of the Grimm Brothers&#8217; influential but controversial 1857 re-write of The Maiden without Hands narrative. I suggest that Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s suppression of the &#8216;unnatural father&#8217; episode, found in the traditional folktale, aided the story&#8217;s survival in and beyond the nineteenth century, when such themes became taboo. I explore how the Grimms&#8217; aesthetic revisions of folk material&#8212;to make them appeal to a middle class audience, including children&#8212;helped proliferate stereotyped representations of females and femininity in classic fairy tales. These depictions, I argue, often cause ambivalence in contemporary female readers, however they also instigate creative revisionary projects (such as my own), which seek to explore the residual energy contained in fairy tale texts, while at the same time destabilising their sexual stereotyping. In the last chapter, &#8220;The Only Thing She Doesn&#8217;t Have is Arms,&#8221; I discuss how extensive research into the many incarnations of The Maiden without Hands altered my understanding of the narrative&#8217;s symbols, tropes and metaphors, leading to significant changes to the plot of my novel. Citing examples from my text, The Girl without Hands, and comparing and contrasting them with excerpts from variants of the folktale and fairy tale, I analyse my creative interpretation of The Maiden without Hands&#8217; major themes: loss and lack; sexual assault and violation; creativity and writing; and, finally, healing and wholeness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Fairy tale</field><field name="subject">Folktale</field><field name="subject">The Girl without Hands</field><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Novel</field><field name="subject">Conversion Disorder</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic manipulation of Grain storage protein digestibility in sorghum.</field><field name="creator">Phuong Mai Hoang</field><field name="description">Abstract Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is the world&#8217;s fifth most common cereal crop and provides an important source of staple food in the semi-arid tropics and feed in many other countries. The plant has the ability to grow and yield in hot and dry climates. However, sorghum grain is less digestible than the other major staple crops such as rice, wheat and maize. Therefore, the aim of this project is to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum grain by applying cutting-edge biotechnologies which involve the use of tissue culture and genetic transformation. Recently, Agrobacterium has been used by many researchers to introduce foreign genes into the sorghum genome. This method has some advantages compared to particle bombardment, however, one limitation is the regeneration of transgenic tissues. In this study successfully transformed sorghum using Agrobacterium and regenerated transgenic plants via an organogenic tissue culture system is reported. The results of transformation efficiency were achieved with co-cultivation after 48 hours. Regeneration of the sorghum transgenic plants was improved by using organogenic tissues. The GUS reporter gene and the Hpt and bar selectable markers were used. Southern blots and PCR were used to confirm transgene presence in the T0 and T1 generations. In this study, stable transgenic sorghum plants have been produced. The factors found to most influence Agrobacterium transformation were the type of organogenic tissue from different genotypes. The genotypes and the period of co-cultivation, as well as the selectable marker gene and selection strategy used. However, the transformation efficiency from this method was low (1.12%) compared with the previous efficiencies published for Agrobacterium-mediated sorghum transformation. Therefore, to improve the transformation efficiency for this method further work may need to be done. Thioredoxin genes were transformed into the sorghum genotype 296B by particle bombardment. In the first experiment no transgenics over-expressing trx and ntr were confirmed by Southern blot. In subsequent experiments, a limited number of transgenics of the T1 generation were confirmed and used for further analysis. A transgenic line with both trx &amp; ntr was created by crossing a trx line and a ntr line. The 2 genes in this line were confirmed and showed different levels of expression by Real Time PCR. Also, the level of expression in the T2 hybrid plants was higher compared to the T1 parents. The grains from the transgenic lines were different in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting properties and in-vitro digestibility. The ntr line was confirmed to be more digestible than the other transgenic lines and a non-transgenic line. There was a significant increase of 11% (P=0.02) in digestibility of the sorghum ntr line over the non-transgenic. However, the transgenic sorghum seeds did not germinate after storage for more than 6 months. Differences in the morphology of the starch granules and protein matrix of the transgenic lines when compared to non-transgenic were observed with Scanning Electron microscopy. The difference was observed from the transition to the central zone. Pores appeared in the starch granules of the sorghum transgenic lines, but not in the non-transgenic. This may be directly related to the changes in gelatinization, viscosity, pasting and digestibility. To find regulatory sequences which can direct expression of transgenes in developing endosperm, the &#946;-kafirin promoter was identified and cloned. Two constructs of varying length were made to test tissue specificity of the promoter, by replacing the Ubi promoter of the pUBIGUS vector. The GUS gene was used as the marker gene under the control of the amplified &#946;-kafirin promoter. The result was determined on different explants of sorghum by transient expression via particle bombardment. The result shows the successful identification of the &#946;-kafirin promoter region and its effect on transient expression levels. Agrobacterium transformation of sorghum organogenic tissue was developed. The digestibility of grain sorghum was improved by over-expressing the thioredoxin genes. In conclusion, the sorghum grain digestibility can be improved by transforming sorghum with thioredoxin genes, via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Further experimentation is required to identify regulatory sequences to optimise transgene expression in sorghum endosperm. In order to determine the reason behind the difficulties of seed germination, larger numbers of independent transgenic lines need to be generated and tested to determine whether over-expression of trx &amp; ntr always has detrimental effects on seed longevity and germination.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorghum transformation, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase over-expressed, Agrobacterium-mediated, organogenic tissue, &#946; -kafirin promoter.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ontology Server for Ontology-based Interoperation of Information Systems</field><field name="creator">Mohammad Ahmad</field><field name="description">In order for information systems supporting two different organizations to interoperate, there must be an agreement as to what the words mean. Such an agreement is often called an ontology, or description of a shared world (a.k.a domain ontology). An ontology in general is an agreed understanding (i.e. semantics) of a certain domain, axiomatized and represented formally as logical theory in a computer resource. It can enable semantic interoperability where autonomous and distributed applications can meaningfully communicate to exchange data and interoperate independently of their internal technologies. The main goal of this thesis is twofold. First (general sense), it presents a specification for ontology engineering to guide ontology designers towards building ontology supporting interoperation of information system using a standard modeling approach. Second (specific sense), it presents a specification for what the ontology server is going to serve at commit-time. At this time, the server is used to assist players to obtain a portion of an ontology relevant to their interoperation requirement. First, we investigate the definition of an ontology as a specification of a conceptualization by showing that an ontology supporting interoperating information systems can be seen as the result of interlocking institutional worlds (IWs). An institutional world is the collection of integrated speech acts and consequent institutional facts made by a particular institution. This institutional world is the conceptualization of which the ontology is the specification. To be more specific, we call this ontology is a domain ontology of IWs. Second, we specify a software system, an ontology server needed to support domain ontology of IWs at commit-time for ontology engineering: 1) Commit-time requirements for an ontology server and 2) Ontology view extraction. The commit-time requirement is a functional requirement of the server to assist a player to obtain a relevant portion of an ontology. The discussion of this requirement has led to research into ontology view extraction. Based on the notion of formal ontology, our approach to ontology view extraction takes into accounts both endurants (entities that exist in time) and perdurants (entities that happen in time). Making a link to the domain ontology of IWs, the speech act is an example of event perdurant, while the institutional fact is an example of endurant. That is, our ontology view extraction involves perdurant ontology (ontology of speech acts) and endurant ontology (ontology of institutional facts). The principal contribution of this work is our technical solution for ontology view extraction. Based on an existing structural metamodel for modeling endurant ontology developed by Guizzardi, we present a technique using existential dependency for endurant extraction starting from a seed provided by the user. Since the user wants to commit to the ontology in order to interoperate with other players, the endurant seed is derived from the actions the user wants to perform, which are described in the perdurant ontology. Our metamodel for perdurant ontology is based on an existing business process metamodel for modeling speech acts, namely, Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations (DEMO). The seed is the institutional facts involved in the speech acts the user wants to perform. These strategies have been implemented by extending with profiles the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Generally, the perdurant ontology is represented by the UML activity diagram, while the endurant ontology is represented by the UML class diagram. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we develop several collections of running examples based on an extended hypothetical ontology for the Olympic Games. This research is a contribution to the theory of conceptual modeling by proposing a set of specifications that can be used to model domain ontology of IWs. The specification here can be understood from two perspectives: 1) Metamodel and 2) Model. The former is addressed at meta-level which consists of metaconcepts for the languages in which the ontologies are represented. The latter is the resulting specification when these metaconcepts are used to represent some aspect of the reality or world in the domain of IWs. Most importantly, the work here contributes to the ontology server research since the view extraction based on the metamodel is what the server is going to serve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Treadmill Walking at High Intensity During Rehabilitation Following Stroke</field><field name="creator">Suzanne Kuys</field><field name="description">The majority of people with stroke regard walking in their community as very important (Lord et al 2004). Walking in the community is limited by slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity (Lord et al 2004; Patterson et al 2007). Slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity are identified sequela in people with stroke (Hill et al 1997). By the end of rehabilitation approximately 80% of people with stroke achieve independent walking (Dean &amp; Mackay 1992; Hill et al 1997). However, less than 10 percent are able to easily walk in their community (Hill et al 1997). Optimal motor learning requires task-specific practice (Carr &amp; Shepherd 2003). Treadmills offer the opportunity for repetitive practice of complete gait cycles (Shepherd &amp; Carr 1999), potentially providing greater intensity and longer duration walking practice than usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Recently there has been some suggestion that high-intensity interventions may improve walking in people with stroke (Moseley et al 2005). Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in people with stroke have been shown to impact on walking, in particular walking capacity (Kelly et al 2003). Treadmills, commonly used to retrain cardiorespiratory fitness in the healthy population, have been used to implement high-intensity interventions, improving cardiorespiratory fitness in people with chronic stroke (Macko et al 2005). Therefore it is possible that exercise aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness may improve walking in people with stroke. The aim of these four studies was to investigate in those following stroke if walking on a treadmill at high-intensity during inpatient rehabilitation could improve walking capacity without compromising pattern and quality. The first study determined, in an Australian setting, the duration and intensity of usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Study 2 compared walking pattern immediately following overground and treadmill walking practice at the same intensity. Study 3 examined the effect of treadmill walking at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness on walking pattern and quality. The final study, investigated the feasibility of implementing a high-intensity treadmill intervention in addition to usual physiotherapy rehabilitation in people following stroke able to walk undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Intensity in all studies was calculated using heart rate reserve or the Karvonen method. Heart rate is a valid, accurate and stable indicator of exercise intensity due to its relatively linear relationship with oxygen consumption (ACSM 2006). For those people taking beta-blocker medication, the heart rate-lowering effect of this type of medication was accommodated. A target intensity of 40% heart rate reserve was used; as this is the minimum required improve cardiorespiratory fitness (ACSM 2006). Walking pattern and quality were measured in Studies 2-4. Walking pattern was measured by linear kinematics using GAITRite (CIR Systems, Clifton, NJ, USA) and angular kinematics using a 2-dimensional webcam application. Walking quality was determined by observation of the webcam footage and scored using the Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Wisconsin Gait Scale and a vertical visual analogue scale by blinded assessor. The first study found that people with stroke spent an average of 21 (SD 11) minutes participating in standing and walking activities that are associated with reaching the target intensity during physiotherapy rehabilitation. Those who could walk spent longer in these activities (25 minutes, SD 12) compared to those would couldn&#8217;t walk (17 minutes, SD 9). However, the intensity of these activities was low; walkers reached a maximum of 30% heart rate reserve and non-walkers reached 35% heart rate reserve. Using the treadmill as a mode of task-specific physiotherapy rehabilitation, the second study in this thesis found that walking pattern was similar following 10 minutes of treadmill and overground walking practice at the same intensity. The third study found that during walking on the treadmill at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (up to 60% heart rate reserve), many of the linear and angular kinematic parameters moved closer to a more normal pattern and walking quality was not compromised. The final study in this thesis, a randomised controlled trial, found that a 6-week high-intensity treadmill walking intervention was feasible in people with stroke able to walk who were undergoing rehabilitation. Participants attended 89% of the treadmill sessions, reaching an average duration of more than 20 minutes and an intensity of 40% heart rate reserve after two weeks. The intervention also appeared effective with significant improvements in walking speed and capacity following the treadmill walking intervention. Improvements in walking speed were maintained at 3 months. In summary, these studies found that usual physiotherapy in people with stroke was of low intensity. In addition, it was found that treadmill walking was safe and feasible as a means of increasing the intensity of physiotherapy rehabilitation, without compromising walking quality and pattern. Therefore, it may be possible to improve walking in people with stroke using high-intensity treadmill walking.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke Rehabilitation,</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy,</field><field name="subject">Gait,</field><field name="subject">Treadmill</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of 129Xe NMR to the Study of the behaviour of Polymers in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide</field><field name="creator">Kylie Varcoe</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">xenon, nuclear magnetic resonance, NMR, supercritical carbon dioxide, polymers, Kalrez, interaction parameters</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184958</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership development in Queensland Christian Brothers schools</field><field name="creator">McManus, Brendan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">130211 Religion Curriculum and Pedagogy</field><field name="subject">2204 Religion and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">Christian Brothers, Irish -- Education -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools -- Queensland -- Administration.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pragmatic Transfer by Chinese EFL Learners in Requests</field><field name="creator">Wei Li</field><field name="description">The present study investigates pragmatic transfer by Chinese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) at low and high proficiency levels in email requests. Data was elicited using an email production questionnaire consisting of four email situations, which vary along two social dimensions: relative power, either equal or higher, and size of imposition, either big or small. Four groups of participants, who were all university students, took part in the study. Thirty-seven Chinese native speakers of Mandarin and 35 Australian native speakers of English provided the baseline data. Thirty-five Chinese EFL learners at low proficiency level and 38 Chinese EFL learners at high proficiency level provided the target data. Altogether 580 emails were collected. Data was classified according to an adapted version of the coding scheme developed by Blum-Kulka et al. (1989). Email requests were analyzed at both the utterance and discourse levels. At the utterance level, directness level, strategy types and internal modifiers were examined. At the discourse level, external modifiers, including all the supportive moves in the opening, body, and closing of an email request were analyzed. Following Beebe et al. (1990), data was looked at in terms of the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis methods were adopted. To determine evidence of pragmatic transfer, first, the Chinese baseline data and the English baseline data were compared. The EFL data was then compared with that of the two baseline groups. Pragmatic transfer was confirmed if the EFL data resembled the Chinese baseline data but differed from the English baseline data. In addition, the instances of pragmatic transfer displayed by the EFL groups at low and high proficiency levels were compared to examine the correlation between pragmatic transfer and language proficiency, that is, whether pragmatic transfer increases or decreases as learners&#8217; language proficiency increases. Pragmatic transfer was investigated on both pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic levels. Findings of the present study show that pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic transfer occurred at the utterance and the discourse levels in all three areas: the frequency, content and average number of pragmatic features, by both the low and high proficiency EFL learners. Moreover, a comparison of the performance of requests by the two learner groups indicates that the high proficiency learners had a greater amount of pragmatic transfer than the low proficiency learners. The findings of this study lend strong support to the positive correlation hypothesis proposed by T. Takahashi and Beebe (1987). The findings of the present study highlight the importance of the inclusion of pragmatic components in foreign language teaching. Pedagogical implications of the findings are discussed. Possible suggestions regarding how to improve the EFL learners&#8217; pragmatic competence are provided.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">pragmalinguistic transfer</field><field name="subject">sociopragmatic transfer</field><field name="subject">request</field><field name="subject">directness</field><field name="subject">indirectness</field><field name="subject">politeness</field><field name="subject">pragmatic failure</field><field name="subject">pragmatic competence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evan Mackenzie : pioneer merchant pastoralist of Moreton Bay / John H.G.

Forrestal as Cold War Policymaker: A Re-Assessment</field><field name="creator">Belinda Lohrisch</field><field name="description">This thesis critically examines the career and significance of America&#8217;s first Secretary of Defence James V. Forrestal from a post-Cold War perspective. Within traditional Cold War scholarship, Forrestal&#8217;s legacy is problematic. The nature of his role as a defence administrator, combined with his suicide in 1949, has led scholars to underestimate his significance and relegate his legacy to the occasional biography. The few studies that examine his contribution utilise conventional analytical approaches that fail to fully assess his policymaking impact. The end of the Cold War, however, has brought additional insight into the policy concerns that dominated the conflict, new analytical approaches to its scholarship and fresh material on which to base a re-assessment. As this thesis demonstrates, the employment of new methodologies to study Forrestal&#8217;s impact is long overdue. By drawing on theories specifically related to leadership and decision-making behaviour, this thesis brings a deeper, fuller understanding of Forrestal&#8217;s policy-making impact as a Cold War official through an examination of his professional conduct. Despite Forrestal&#8217;s many successes, political controversies surrounding his defence career overshadowed his many achievements. This thesis argues that such controversies were the result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication as a public official, his policy-making and management styles, and the structure of his authority as defence secretary. They were not, as some have argued, the result of his ineffectiveness as a policy-maker, &#8220;hawkish&#8221; attitudes or declining mental health. His collapse, furthermore, was not the natural conclusion of any paranoid delusions or obsessive nature, but rather a result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication to his work at the expense of his own health. This thesis undertakes a content analysis of Forrestal&#8217;s writings and an examination of his policy-making approach, concentrating on the evolution and execution of his policy advice and initiatives, as well as the structure of his authority as secretary of defence. It begins with a biographical overview of his life and public service career, as well as an assessment of existing Cold War scholarship and its general tendency to underestimate Forrestal&#8217;s significance. The components of his legacy are then analysed thematically, with chapters devoted to his foreign policy influence, his role in the unification controversy and his administrative efforts as defence secretary. Throughout, Forrestal&#8217;s career and significance is reassessed both in the application of new theoretical and methodological insights, and the analysis of recently declassified and reorganised documents, particularly the complete and unexpurgated version of Forrestal&#8217;s official diaries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">james forrestal, cold war, policy-making, defence policy, defence administration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Flue Gas Desulphurisation System Utilising Alumina Causticiser Residue</field><field name="creator">Leon Munro</field><field name="description">The ever increasing global demand for materials has placed aluminium as the world&#8217;s second most used metal, with world annual production currently &gt;24 million tons. Consequently, the global alumina industry is perpetually striving to meet demands in conjunction with research, development and implementation of more efficient and sustainable processes and practises. Of specific concern for many proponents within the industry is that increased alumina production inadvertently results in increased Bayer Process-derived alkaline solid and liquid waste loads. Furthermore, in-house power generation at all Australian alumina refineries contributes to acid gas emissions, particularly SOx and NOx, both of which have environmental and anthropogenic impacts of global concern. The focus of this work is SO2 emission. SOx emission control measures can be achieved before, during or after combustion; the latter is termed flue gas desulphurisation (FGD). Commercially available FGD systems are dominated by once-through wet processes whereby the flue gas passes up through an absorbtion tower. The most favourable medium for industrial use is seawater, followed by limestone, and in some cases, a combination of both. However, the ever-increasing stringency of environmental emission legislation continues to inflict tighter controls on power production and is forcing industry to investigate alternative cost-effective FGD mediums. Therefore much research is currently dedicated to the utilisation of high volume, alkaline waste streams over manufactured sorbents. Modern environmental engineering approaches to waste product minimisation, neutralisation and/or reuse have lead to many new processes which change the view of many materials from waste product to environmental resource. Subsequently, this work examines the application of an isolated Bayer Process waste product, tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate (TCA6), as a FGD medium. Initial research assessed the dissolution behaviour and performance of the proposed medium with sulphuric acid, followed by batch reactor trials with a simulated flue gas. Data derived from this research indicated the suitability of TCA6 as a FGD medium and was subsequently applied to a preliminary model and proposed design parameters required for further pilot scale investigations. This work provides strong support for an economically viable and more sustainable approach to FGD for the alumina industry.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bayer Process</field><field name="subject">calcination</field><field name="subject">reduction</field><field name="subject">sulphur dioxide</field><field name="subject">tricalcium aluminate hexahydrate</field><field name="subject">flue gas desulphurisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE FUNCTION AND ACTIVITY: (BIODYNAMIC ANALYSIS)</field><field name="creator">William Mccullagh</field><field name="description">Abstract There is a need in medicine and research for noninvasive, painless, safe and simple bed-side techniques to measure physiological processes associated with muscle function and activity. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a widely used, noninvasive, painless, safe and simple procedure for the measurement of body composition. However, although capable of producing accurate and reproducible data, it is known to be prone to movement artifacts. This poses the interesting question &#8220;Could impedance changes be used to monitor movement and, consequently, be related to muscle function or activity?&#8221; This project investigated the utility of impedance change as a monitoring technique for physiological processes that involve movement such as muscular contraction, the calf muscle pump, and swallowing. The impedance of leg muscle segments during locomotion, whilst riding a stationary exercise cycle, was measured at discrete frequencies and by bioimpedance spectroscopy to monitor muscle function or activity. Impedance traces were compared to information obtained by electromyography (EMG). Impedance, at a discrete frequency, was able to measure the cadence of cycling and its magnitude was related to the position of the pedal during the pedal cycle. When the cycling action was measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy, R0 and Zc showed a statistically significant difference, (p&lt;0.05), between all angles of the pedal crank cycle while R&#8734; showed a statistically significant difference between angles in the lower hemisphere of the pedal crank cycle. The cyclical changes in impedance during cycling may be attributed to changes in shape and volume of the muscle during contraction as well as a volume change due to blood and lymph being pumped from the limb by the action of the calf muscle pump. Based on procedures used in the cycling studies, an impedance-based method for the measurement of calf muscle pump function during an exercise protocol, originally designed for use with air plethysmography, was developed. It was shown that impedance measured at 5 kHz provides a simple, non-invasive method for the measurement of the ejection fraction and ejection volume of the calf muscle pump as well as other haemodynamic variables. The impedance-based method was less technically challenging than accepted volumetric methods, such as air plethysmography and strain gauge plethysmography, and non-invasive c.f. ambulatory venous pressure, enabling it to be used repeatedly. Muscle function and activity is not confined to the legs so impedance changes in the arm and forearm during exercise were measured. Impedance measurements, at discrete frequencies and using bioimpedance spectroscopy, of the forearm during contractions of the hand were able to distinguish the difference between a ramp and a pulse contraction. When the impedance of the arm and forearm were plotted against the angle of the forearm to the horizontal during a bicep curl, there was an hysteresis effect. Impedance traces of a bicep curl were compared to an EMG trace of the same action. The larynx is a hollow muscular organ situated in the front of the neck above the trachea consisting of a framework of cartilages bound together by muscles and ligaments. The two major functions of the larynx are deglutition and phonation. Dysphagia, which is becoming more prevalent as the population ages, is defined as difficulty in swallowing thin liquids such as water or juices which splash into the trachea because the patient is unable to control the thin liquid bolus. Aspiration pneumonia and dehydration can be prevented by using thickened liquids which allow patients to achieve a safer swallowing response, but it is difficult to assess this response without interfering with the swallowing process. Impedance pharynography (IPG) is a technique using BIA to monitor an impedance waveform of the swallowing process that presents no radiation hazard to the patient, is non-invasive and does not require specialist trained personnel to operate it. Resistance changes across the neck were measured while subjects swallowed solutions of different viscosities. The resistance changes were distinctive and reproducible for each of the solutions of different viscosities which were swallowed. Measuring the function of the larynx by this method could be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia. In conclusion, the studies described in this thesis demonstrate the potential usefulness of the measurement of change in impedance as a measure of muscle activity. Impedance-based methods can measure volume changes associated with changes in cross-sectional area of the muscles involved in contraction as well as compartmental fluid changes caused by the force of the contraction on the surrounding tissues including the vasculature. In particular, measuring the ejection fraction and other haemodynamic variables of the calf muscle pump by impedance has the potential to become the method of choice in the future because it is easy to use, inexpensive, non-invasive, safe, and hygenic. Measuring resistance changes across the neck during swallowing yields distinctive waveforms with features corresponding to the physiological phases of the swallowing process as well as identifying distinctive swallowing patterns associated with the different viscosities of liquids swallowed. Function of the larynx and the associated diseases of the larynx will potentially be easier to diagnose and treat with a safe, non-invasive, inexpensive, portable bed-side method of assessment such as BIA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">impedance, calf muscle pump, dysphonia, dysphagia, bioelectrical impedance analysis, hysteresis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of middle school science textbooks recommended for use with a constructivist syllabus in Queensland schools.</field><field name="creator">Christine Milne</field><field name="description">This thesis describes an analysis of science textbooks, eight years after the implementation of the Years 1-10 Queensland Science Syllabus, which suggested a move towards constructivist teaching in Queensland schools (QSSC 1999). The textbooks have been analysed for evidence of constructivism, and this has led to recommendations for writing better textbooks. This thesis has been written in five chapters. In Chapter 1, a review of literature develops a conceptual framework, which is the basis of this research. Chapter 2 describes the process used to develop its methodology, and Chapter 3 presents the results of this analysis. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the findings of this research and its implications for textbook content and design. In the literature review the themes of constructivism and the nature of science and the use of textbooks by teachers are explored. It suggests that textbooks continue to be central to developing curriculum, that they are used as a reference and as an independent learning tool, rather than as a guide to enacting curriculum. It also shows constructivist teaching closely aligns with authentic science, that it moves school science closer to that practised by scientists, and that it can engender improvements in teaching practice and in student interest. The data from this research has been collected using an analytical grid developed from three successive trials, after the literature review showed no previously developed analytical grid was suitable. In this final version of the grid, Likert scales are used to observe four dimensions of constructivism in textbook activities: coherence (use knowledge and concepts in a range of contexts), student-centredness of inquiries, language used and analysis questions to practice making new knowledge claims. The unit of analysis was ecology chapters of four middle school science textbooks. The research questions asked in this study are as follows: &#8226; Is a constructivist approach discernable in the textbooks reviewed in terms of the four dimensions of constructivism identified in the literature review? &#8226; What elements of constructivism are readily identifiable, and therefore are easily included in textbooks? &#8226; What elements of constructivism are not discernable? The results of this research have been synthesised and show no textbook could be considered constructivist, although one textbook had inquiries that could be considered exemplary. Two of the textbooks had no claim to be constructivist because they lacked inquiries, and this is where students experience the methods of scientists and practise making knowledge claims. &#8195; Other conclusions of this research include the following: &#8226;All textbooks reviewed were deficient in at least one dimension of constructivism, and those with one inquiry cannot be constructivist; &#8226;Activities and contexts made textbooks more coherent; &#8226;Technical terms were reduced compared to what has been traditionally covered by textbooks, however technical terms are also essential to scientific literacy and need to be used appropriately; &#8226;Most methods of inquiries are prescribed, so they do not allow students to solve problems in their own relevant contexts; even in those textbooks with more inquiries; &#8226;There was little evidence of hypothetico-deductive reasoning in inquiries rather data collection and simple analysis were usually suggested. Guidelines for writing better textbooks have become apparent from this research. Coherent textbooks are inherently constructivist because they apply concepts across contexts, and have more inquiries. Inquiries with a rigorous, authentic hypothetico-deductive approach arise naturally when the methods, concepts and language of science are applied in contexts that students are likely to find relevant and interesting, and where real-life problems need to be solved. Adopting these recommendations could lead to textbooks being more centrally positioned in enacting curriculum than now, because they are more likely to be constructivist (and represent the best thinking in the field).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">constructivism, science textbooks, middle school, ecology, philosophy of science, language, inquiries</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185237</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electricity Deregulation, Vertical Integration and the Importance of Independent Electricity Retailers</field><field name="creator">Donald Burtt</field><field name="description">Abstract The natural progression of generators and retailers, following electricity deregulation, to vertically integrate is a contentious subject involving, at one extreme, expectations that a laissez- faire market approach will deliver economic benefits to all participants, and at the other extreme, suspicions that the unusual features of the electricity sector, in providing generators with market power, may not provide electricity consumers with an improved outcome. The objectives of this thesis were to: understand fully the drivers of generators and retailers to vertically integrate and to apply this knowledge to the Queensland electricity market to determine the financial impact on generators, retailers and consumers from vertical integration (VI). A literature review was undertaken of VI in a generic sense, noting the distinction between market contracting and &#8216;internalisation&#8217;, with particular reference to the writings of Oliver Williamson. The Federal Court case involving Australia&#8217;s largest electricity retailer, Australian Gas and Light Ltd, seeking approval to purchase a minority shareholding in the Victorian generator Loy Yang Power, was closely examined from the perspectives of theoretical and practical electricity sector VI integration issues. A quantitative analysis was undertaken of an assumed 60% VI of the Queensland electricity market to assess the costs and benefits to generators that vertically integrated and to consumers. The quantified generator benefits included margin elimination, savings in overheads, more rapid decision-making, and demand side management (DSM) savings in deferred capital expenditure on peaking generation and network expenditure through reduced peak demand. To support the quantitative analysis, two scenario models were developed. The first model replicates the process by which generators build up revenue certainty over time from hedge contract sales and bidding of output into the electricity grid. How generator bidding behaviour is affected by the level of hedge cover and hedge contract prices is examined, particularly in regard to how this behavior is affected by the competitive relationship between retailers and generators. The second scenario model replicates the attitude of vertically integrated generators (VIGs) towards offering DSM services by observing how the attitude of individual VIGs is affected by level of peaking generation and by the generation-to-retailing output proportion. It was determined that a combination of these features and particular market scenarios could result in some VIGs being financially worse off by providing DSM services, an important conclusion in the context of the increased community focus on energy conservation. The extent to which VIGs pass on VI and DSM benefits to consumers was calculated under scenarios of weak and strong retail competition. Of most relevance was the difference in market behaviour between retailers that had became vertically integrated, and those that had not, with the latter expected to become less competitive in both the wholesale and retail markets. This outcome was observed to provide generators with additional market power potential, a subject closely examined. The quantitative analysis of the Queensland market concluded that the maximum possible benefit that consumers could expect from VI was $138 million per annum with current DSM technology and strong retail competition, increasing to $156 million per annum if DSM technology improved, for example in regard to more cost-efficient meters. Total possible benefits to VIGs and consumers was estimated at $321 million per annum, so that consumers could expect to receive no more than 50% of total expected benefits from VI. This conclusion is not surprising because generators will only seek to be vertically integrated if they perceive clearly identified benefits from VI. The reasons why consumers are unlikely to receive benefits greater than this are: &#8226; $30 million per annum of internal savings being retained by VIGs; &#8226; VIGs achieving a minimum $60 million per annum additional revenue benefits through wholesale and retail price increases, arising from their stronger generation and retail positions; and &#8226; $75 million per annum of potential DSM benefits not being offered to consumers, because of the reluctance of VIGs to provide DSM services where the outcome could be reduced export revenue, reduced sales revenue and lower pool prices. In summary, using the Queensland market as a case study, in a strongly competitive retail market consumers could expect to receive, at the most, 50% of VI and DSM benefits. However in a weakly competitive retail market, where VIGs retain most of the benefits and are able to achieve higher wholesale prices, the outcome could instead be an overall cost to consumers. The thesis concludes with a brief discussion of policy implications and approaches to addressing key issues arising from increasing VI in deregulated electricity markets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electricity Deregulation</field><field name="subject">Vertical Integration</field><field name="subject">Independent Electricity Retailers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Mobility in a Hybrid Chinese Economy: Social Capital and Emerging Entrepreneurs</field><field name="creator">Pamela Jackson</field><field name="description">As China develops and progresses as a nation, unique patterns of social mobility are emerging. For many years a centrally planned economy, the country is now a hybrid economy characterised by its authoritative political structure while allowing its entrepreneurs to experiment with innovative ways to accumulate wealth and &#8216;get ahead&#8217;. The research is particularly interested and aims in understanding how a specific group of people, namely the home-grown entrepreneurs, have been able to achieve social mobility within the contemporary Chinese economy. It focuses on the city of Suzhou in Jiangsu Province. Suzhou was chosen as the research setting because, since the beginning of the 1980s, it has been rapidly transformed into a business and industrial centre by implementation of economic reforms shaped by Deng Xiaoping and the production of infrastructure, such as the Economic and Technological Development Zones, from Communist Party initiatives. Home-grown entrepreneurs were ready to take advantage of the booming business opportunities by using their personal resources and networks afforded by the economic reforms that introduced foreign direct investment to coincide with private business reform. Specifically, it examines how the economic reforms have fostered conditions that allowed home-grown entrepreneurs to emerge and prosper and, in turn, how these entrepreneurs cultivate and utilise their social capital to form strategies to create pathways leading to social mobility. Qualitative research uncovers the social mobility of these entrepreneurs by interviewing in-depth a total of 50 home-grown entrepreneurs from different generations currently operating in Suzhou. The research reveals that while the economic reforms did provide a favourable environment for conducting private businesses, it has been equally important for each generation of home-grown entrepreneurs to take specific risks and seize opportunities to acquire various forms of social capital and to adjust personal values and imposed goals to reflect the complex social and political dynamics of their times. They had to make appropriate decisions to consolidate their businesses through careful consideration and manipulation of a variety of social capital. While social mobility may seem more accessible under the new hybrid economy, business failures and growing social inequalities have not been uncommon. Data analysis provides insights to conclude that the research may construct a new normative theory about a value driven society with economic aspirations within social controls constructed by authoritarian capitalism. As home-grown entrepreneurs begin to dominate, they are not only redefining how various forms of social capital should be linked to trajectories for social mobility, increasingly they are also transforming the social landscapes of China&#8217;s business world.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China, Entrepreneurship, Social Capital, Social Mobility</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taint</field><field name="creator">Cheryl Jorgensen</field><field name="description">Abstracts THE TAINT This is a memoir of Ray &#8220;Poss&#8221; Ide, a man who has carried the taint of a horrifying crime since he was seventeen years old&#9472;a crime he claims he did not commit. The crime was the rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. The Taint looks at the time leading up to his conviction for rape, including the years he spent in Westbrook Boys&#8217; Reformatory and Boggo Road Gaol as a minor, and then his sentence served in NSW gaols with such inmates as Stephen Bradley, the man who kidnapped and murdered Graham Thorne, and the bizarre but rather likeable Dave Scanlan, known for his exploits as &#8220;the Kingsgrove Slasher&#8221;. In prison, Scanlan encouraged him to become an elite sportsman and released, Poss was recruited by Canterbury Eels football team; but just on the point of making a name for himself in Sydney, someone discovered that he had been gaoled for rape, and humiliated, he left the team. He moved back home to Queensland via Grafton, NSW (where he met and later married the Jacaranda Queen) and continued his sporting career, but never again in the Big League. He became the Manager of the Waterside Workers&#8217; Club and helped prevent a turf war between the Wharfies and members of the Painters and Dockers. Poss is now working with lawyer Robert Bax to have his case re-opened. He believes his story to be a cautionary tale for young men. It is a chronicle of social change, including the sexual revolution of the sixties, the confrontations with &#8220;the demons&#8221; in the streets of Brisbane during the Joh era of Bible-bashing fundamentalism and police corruption. It&#8217;s a story about what really went on behind closed doors in institutions where vulnerable children were preyed upon, in gaols where men were expected to become beasts. It is a story of how the taint of a terrible crime affected a man&#8217;s whole life. &#8220;QUESTIONS OF OWNERSHIP&#8221; Writing someone else&#8217;s story can be an ethical minefield&#9472;especially regarding questions of ownership. Who owns the story, the subject or the author? The easy answer to this is the subject owns the story and the author the text, but on closer examination this may not necessarily be so. Then there are those other stakeholders who claim ownership of story: people who embrace a narrative because of its similarity to their own lives. Published stories about institutional abuse have resonated for adults who as children were placed into the care of churches or the state. Another kind of ownership is claimed by readers who accept a version of a story and dismiss any counter-story as being invalid. What I call the &#8220;Plath Phenomenon&#8221; is an example of this. I will examine these kinds of ownership of story with particular reference to the work of Janet Malcolm on biography and then will look at gaps and silences in &#8220;official&#8221; stories, those created in police stations and courtrooms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">police corruption, injustice, Bjelke-Petersen, unions, verballing, court transcripts, sportsmanship, prison life, Westbrook, tainted evidence.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opposition to C. Julius Caesar: Motives, Methods, Successes and the Question of Tyranny.</field><field name="creator">Mark Avery</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the motives, methods and successes of opposition to C. Julius Caesar in the period 60-50 leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49. An attempt has been made to distinguish between traditional and innovative methods of opposition. An evaluation of creativity levels and the social acceptability of actions has been conducted in an effort to understand adherence to moral standards in the pre-war period. In Chapter 2, opposition to Caesar in 60 and 59 is examined and found to be fierce, persistent and, despite Caesar ultimately achieving his aims, successful in a limited way. Chapter 3 examines the circumstances of 58-57. Caesar&#8217;s position was more firmly secured through the agency of Clodius&#8217; tribunate, during which Cicero was exiled and Cato was removed from the political scene for both political and personal reasons. Examination of opposition to Caesar in Chapter 4 focuses on the period 56-54. It is demonstrated that prior to the conferences of Luca and Ravenna, opposition to Caesar was broadly undertaken by groups or individuals who fomented dissent between Crassus and Pompey in order to undermine the triumvirate as a whole. In 55 opposition to Caesar was nullified by a renewal of the triumvirate. In 54 opposition was resurgent and dominated the courts with limited success. In Chapter 5, opposition to Caesar in the period 53-50 is examined and is shown to be marked by anarchy, attempted reforms and the disintegration of the triumviral alliance. Given widespread impressions of pressure, corruption, violence and breakdown, especially in modern accounts of the period, it is suprising to discover that tactics used by Caesar&#8217;s opponents were traditional and socially acceptable for the most part, despite vehement political and personal disagreement. The will of the people was still respected by Caesar&#8217;s opponents; popular opinion in 59 was in fact the cause of opposition failure. While the Republic had suffered civil war in the opening decades of the first century BC, the state had resumed constitutional operation prior to 60. Traditional moral values and methods of gaining rank and prestige were still important and continued to be adhered to after 60. Methods of influence and social communication remained largely unchanged in the 50s, and ensured the continuity of political exchange without substantial innovation. From 56 to 54 opposition methods were opportunistic, a result of the renewal of the triumvirate. Caesar&#8217;s opponents continued to adhere to traditional political practice, despite dominance of the political machinary by the triumvirate. In 54 Caesar&#8217;s opponents gained control of the law courts, which resulted in numerous trials but no break with traditional or socially acceptable behaviour. Opposition between 53 and 50 remained traditional in most cases within an environment marked by anarchy and political stalemate, fueled by the intransigence of Caesar and Pompey who refused to recognise each others&#8217; dignitas. The Civil War, then, was not caused by an extended period of constitutional instability. The Civil War was the result of political deadlock at the end of the 50s, motivated by the social and political inflexibility of a small group of Senators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">caesar, roman republic, politics, roman law, voting assemblies, roman senate, pompey, cicero, cato minor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cancers of the Oesophagus: Exploring the Roles of Smoking, Alcohol and Gastro-oesophageal Reflux</field><field name="creator">Nirmala Pandeya</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Background Oesophageal cancer has a high mortality; it is the 6th most common cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Of the common subtypes of oesophageal cancer, it is the adenocarcinomas that have been rising rapidly in incidence throughout the western world. The incidence of adenocarcinomas now exceeds the previously common squamous cell carcinoma. These recent changes in the incidence patterns of oesophageal cancer suggests that the environmental risk factors associated with these subtypes differ, and that changes in the prevalence of these exposures over time are the most likely explanation for the observed shifts in the incidence. However, due to its low incidence until a few decades ago, the adenocarcinoma subtype has been less studied compared to squamous cell carcinoma, and the environmental factors associated with this cancer have not been so clearly defined. Smoking and alcohol have been the strongest environmental risk factors reported for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whereas for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), the effect of smoking appears to be weaker, and the evidence for an effect of alcohol is scant and inconsistent. However, epidemiologic studies consistently identify people with frequent symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) as having the highest risk of OAC, but the effect of GOR on OSCC has been negligible. Furthermore, it has been argued that adenocarcinoma occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJAC) may have different aetiology again. Together, these reports suggest the three subtypes of oesophageal cancers (OAC, GOJAC and OSCC) may arise through different mechanisms with different strengths in the impact of risk factors. This thesis investigated the independent associations of smoking, alcohol and gastro-oesophageal reflux on cancers of the oesophagus by considering the possibility of variation in the risks due to differences in the dose effect patterns of various measures such as smoking, alcohol and GOR. Method Data from a population-based case-control study of oesophageal and ovarian cancers in Australia were used. Study participants comprised histologically confirmed cases of OSCC (n=308), OAC (n=367) and GOJAC (n=426) who were frequency matched to 1580 controls from the general population. Exposure history for both cases and controls were derived from health and lifestyle questionnaires. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the risk factors analysed. In addition, generalised additive model with a logit link was also used to explore and present the non-linearity in the dose effect pattern for continuous exposures adjusting for other confounding factors. The effects of two exposures combined on these cancers were assessed by obtaining synergy index. Results Smokers were at significantly higher risk of all three subtypes of oesophageal cancer with the risk greatest for OSCC. The effect of smoking was greater for adenocarcinoma occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction compared to that of the oesophagus. Of the various measures of smoking, duration was significantly associated with all three subtypes of cancer whereas intensity was associated with only OSCC and GOJAC and the dose effect was non-linear. Time since quitting was associated with a steady decline in risk of all three cancers emphasising the health benefits of quitting among smokers. Alcohol was not associated with OAC or GOJAC but was significantly associated with OSCC among those drinking in excess of 170g/week. The association between alcohol and OSCC was modified by smoking; the association with alcohol was significantly greater among current smokers with effect. Low to moderate wine consumption was associated with significant risk reduction for all three cancers compared to non-drinkers. Increased frequency of GOR symptoms was associated with increased risks of OAC and GOJAC, although the risk of OSCC was constrained to frequent GOR symptoms only. The effect of GOR symptoms were exacerbated by smoking whereas it was weakened by regular NSAID use. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis that assessed the effect of non-participation among controls in the estimated effect of smoking and BMI (the two risk factors most likely to be affected by non-participation) showed a slight overestimation of effect of smoking assuming higher exposure rate among non-participants but not BMI while the effect remained strong and statistically significant. Conclusion Smoking, alcohol and GOR symptoms were the environmental factors strongly associated with all subtypes of oesophageal cancers. However, the dose effect patterns of these exposures varied by cancer subtypes. Smoking and alcohol were the larger contributing factors for OSCC whereas smoking and GOR symptoms had greater impact on OAC and GOJAC. Low to moderate wine consumption and regular NSAID use reduced the risk of all three subtypes significantly. While selection bias may have led to mildly inflated risks for smoking, the effects persisted even when modelled under extreme scenarios of biased participation amongst controls, and there was no evidence that selection bias materially affected the other associations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oesophageal cancer, risk factors, smoking, alcohol, gastro-oesophageal reflux</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF A CONTEMPORARY REMOTE URBAN INDIGENOUS ETHNOMEDICAL SYSTEM AND THE SOCIO-CLINICAL REALITY SHAPED BY THE RESERVE DWELLERS AND THE HOSPITAL RESIDENTS IN THE 1980s</field><field name="creator">Robyn Mobbs</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study in medical anthropology is a critically interpretative analysis of fieldwork documentation I recorded during field research conducted in the mining city of Mount Isa in the far northwest of Queensland during the 1980s. Eighteen months of participant observation research was undertaken over four fieldtrips (1981-82, 1983, 1985 and 1988) at inter-connected locations: two urban reserves for Aborigines and the people I refer to as the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the local hospital and a group of hospital resident medical officers who I refer to as the Residents. During the field research I found that both Reserve Dwellers and the Residents experienced a difficult relationship during their interactions in medical consultations in the hospital clinics. Now in this dissertation I ask an overarching question of my time-lag field data. It is How can we understand the problematic relationship between indigenous reserve-dwelling help-seekers and biomedical practitioners at their local hospital clinics in the 1980s. To describe this problematic relationship I analyse time-lag data from my diaried participant observation at both the reserves and the hospital; semi-structured interviews with the hospital Residents; case studies and case histories of consenting help-seekers from the Reserves; and illustrative transcriptions of consultations between Residents and Reserve Dwellers that were tape recorded by the Residents during hospital clinics. The contemporary ethnomedical system of the Reserve Dwellers was inclusive of biomedicalized clinics and the Residents as clinicians at this remote hospital in the 1980s. I provide an ethnographic account of a changing contemporary indigenous ethnomedical system and describe the lifeways of the Reserve Dwellers in the 1980s; their pattern of help-seeking at their local hospital including grievous happenings; and their experiences in outpatients clinics and the emergency section of the local non-indigenous hospital. Their lifeways and help-seeking were in many ways defined by the collective sociality of Kalkadunga and other regional indigenous cultures as impoverished, very sick survivors of a genocidal contact history less than 100 years before. This local history is also reconstructed. The Residents view of local indigenous illness, help-seeking, and experiences of biomedicalised hospital clinics further describe the socio-cultural reality of the time. I found that the Residents had an insightful, even predictive assessment of local illness burden. At the same time, they held strong views about a pattern of help-seeking in the outpatients and emergency clinics that was considered disruptive of hospital routines. I also describe how they expressed their difficulties interacting with Aboriginal help-seekers including the taking of biomedical histories. My thesis is that a localized socio-clinical reality was shaped by a synchronic, coeval relationship between Reserve Dwellers enculturated within a changing, contemporary ethnomedical belief system that incorporated biomedicalized hospital clinics, and the Residents as clinicians enculturated within a culture of biomedical science at a remote hospital. I argue that the lifeways and pattern of help-seeking of the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the Residents&#8217; views about sick indigenous help-seekers, formed this particular socio-clinical reality. It was then consistently replicated by problematic socio-clinical interaction and biomedicalized praxis that inhibited investigation and curative outcomes for the Reserve Dwellers and other indigenous help-seekers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal health and hospitals, indigenous lifeways, indigenous help-seeking, socio-clinical reality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic etiology of human sexuality</field><field name="creator">Brendan Zietsch</field><field name="description">Sexuality is central to our individual lives, our society, and our evolution, but its etiology is not thoroughly understood. Using data from 4904 Australian twins who completed a questionnaire on sexual attitudes and behaviours, I investigated the genetic and environmental influences underlying variation in and covariation between psychological and behavioural aspects of sexuality. Moreover, I explored the role of sexuality traits in several different contexts: evolution, mental health, public health, personality, and problematic behaviour. Before presenting reports of the four main empirical studies in this thesis, I make the case for the importance of studying human sexuality, outline previous findings on the etiology of individual differences in sexuality, and describe the behavioural genetic principles and techniques that were used in the investigations. I also present an additional fifth paper reporting a behavioural genetic analysis of EEG power, which I undertook in order to learn twin data modelling and complex multivariate techniques. In the first empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from an evolutionary perspective. As sexual orientation is genetically influenced, it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency. I tested the hypothesis that while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals&#8217; reproductive success, they may confer some advantage for heterosexuals who carry them. Results showed that psychologically masculine females and feminine men are 1) more likely to be nonheterosexual, but 2) when they are heterosexual have more opposite-sex sexual partners. Genetic modelling revealed that both these relationships are partly due to pleiotropic genetic influences common to each trait. Further, heterosexuals with a nonheterosexual twin had more opposite-sex partners than do heterosexual twin pairs. Taken together, these results suggest that genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could contribute to the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population. In the second empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from the perspective of mental health risk. Large epidemiological studies have shown that homosexuals are at much greater risk of psychiatric disorder than the general population. This has been assumed, with some supporting evidence, to be because of the prejudice and discrimination experienced by homosexuals in a heterosexist society. Here I tested the viability of alternative explanations, using Eysenck&#8217;s Neuroticism and Psychoticism scales as markers for psychiatric vulnerability. Firstly, I tested whether apparent sexual orientation differences in psychiatric vulnerability simply mirror sex differences &#8211; for our traits, this would predict nonheterosexual males having elevated Neuroticism scores as females do, and nonheterosexual females having elevated Psychoticism scores as males do. The results contradicted this idea, with nonheterosexual men and women scoring significantly higher on both Neuroticism and Psychoticism than their heterosexual counterparts, suggesting an overall elevation of psychiatric risk in nonheterosexuals. Secondly, I used the genetically informative sample to assess the viability of explanations invoking a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability. We found significant genetic correlations between sexual orientation and both Neuroticism and Psychoticism, but no corresponding environmental correlations, suggesting that if there is a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability it is likely to have a genetic basis rather than an environmental basis. The third empirical paper investigated the etiology of risky sexual behaviour, which is relevant to public health and welfare through its role in STD transmission and unwanted pregnancies. Results showed that variation in risky sexual behaviour is due to genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental influences to approximately equal degrees. The genetic influences partly overlapped with genetic influences on dispositional factors, with significant genetic correlations between risky sexual behaviour and Eysenck&#8217;s Impulsivity, Extraversion, Psychoticism, and Neuroticism. This suggests that the genetic influences that shape our personality may also predispose us to risky sexual behaviour. The fourth empirical paper investigated the etiology of a strong association (r = .50) between risky sexual behaviour and adolescent misconduct. Results indicated that the association is due to overlapping genetic and environmental influences, but that in males genes are the primary source of the association whereas in females shared environment plays the greater role. These findings suggest that a general predisposition to risky behaviour may manifest in different potentially harmful ways in adolescence (misconduct) and adulthood (risky sexual behaviour), and that different processes are involved in male and female etiology. Following the empirical reports, I provide a general discussion of my research findings and the study of human sexuality more generally. After summarising the findings and their implications, I then provide a detailed description of potential limitations of the research and to what extent they qualify the conclusions drawn. I also critically discuss the absence of sexuality traits from the major models of personality, and why this and other shortcomings make the personality models inadequate from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, I suggest directions for future research in light of the research and discussion presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual orientation</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">risky sexual behaviour</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using wildlife tourism and post-visit support to enhance families&#8217; conservation learning at Mon Repos Conservation Park</field><field name="creator">Karen Hughes</field><field name="description">Abstract Nature-based tourism and wildlife tourism are becoming increasingly popular worldwide and are often promoted as a means of protecting and preserving environmental resources. These forms of tourism are usually accompanied by interpretation such as signs, presentations and activities specifically designed to raise visitors&#8223; awareness of, and concern for, environmental issues. The rationale behind this approach is that enhancing visitors&#8223; environmental knowledge, understanding and attitudes prompts the adoption of environmentally responsible behaviours. This is supported by a growing body of research that suggests that environmental interpretation has considerable potential to impact upon visitors&#8223; conservation knowledge and attitudes, and that well-designed interpretive experiences and messages are an effective means of reducing a range of negative &#8222;on-site&#8223; behaviours such as littering, straying from walkways and feeding wildlife. However, there has been little exploration of whether environmental interpretation influences the uptake of conservation practices &#8222;off-site&#8223; or how the positive impacts of nature-based tourism can be maintained over time. Until recently, tourism research exploring post-visit behaviour has used visitors&#8223; immediate post-visit intentions as a measure of behaviour change. There is increasing evidence, however, that stated intentions to engage in conservation behaviours rarely manifest as actual behaviour, and that visitors&#8223; on-site enthusiasm and commitment tends to wane following their visit. The current research aimed to investigate whether providing visitors with post-visit support in the form of learning materials and reminders would prevent this decline and enhance long-term conservation learning (hereby defined as knowledge, attitudes and behaviour). This research explores short and long-term changes in families&#8223; conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour following their visit to Mon Repos Conservation Park, a world renowned turtle rookery in Queensland, Australia. Stage one of the study involved surveying 100 Australian families to identify barriers and benefits associated with six conservation practices (re-using containers, buying minimal packaging, reducing use of plastic bags, picking up litter, recycling and composting). Using Community-based Social Marketing theory, responses informed the development of printed and online post-visit action resources specifically designed to reinforce the wildlife tourism experience and support families&#8223; conservation learning. Resources focused on the six conservation behaviours outlined above but also included other environmental activities and conservation information of relevance. v In stage two, two hundred Australian families visiting Mon Repos in December 2007 and January 2008 were sampled and assigned to either a treatment group (provided with post-visit action resources and regular contact) or the control group (no post-visit support). All families were asked to complete pre-visit, post-visit and follow-up questionnaires to enable the researcher to ascertain short-term and long-term changes in their conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and to identify factors contributing to the uptake of off-site conservation practices. The final sample comprised the one hundred families who completed all three questionnaires. Comparisons between responses of the control and treatment groups revealed that post-visit action resources reinforced respondents&#8223; knowledge of threats to turtles and enhanced their attitudes towards protecting wildlife and the natural environment. Families who received post-visit support were also significantly more likely to pick up litter and introduced more conservation actions than those who did not receive this support. Aspects of the post-visit action resources that were particular effective were updates of turtle activity at Mon Repos, emails, fact sheets and the newsletter. Other factors that prompted the adoption of conservation practices included Mon Repos&#8223; interpretation and the opportunity to view wildlife in its natural surroundings. The influence of other family members and pre-visit knowledge and interest were also found to be associated with subsequent uptake of conservation behaviours. Implications for wildlife interpretive practice and the design and delivery of post-visit support are discussed and recommendations for future research presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation learning</field><field name="subject">wildlife tourism</field><field name="subject">family learning</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="subject">Community-Based Social Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making war real: the discourse of professional journalism and the Iraq War, 2003.</field><field name="creator">Giles Dodson</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT As this thesis argues, the pursuit of professionalism in journalism should be understood as a discourse that hegemonises the discursive formation of journalism and produces news that fulfils professional needs. Professionalism articulates and states its object, in this case war, rather than apprehending it through fidelity to normative criteria, such as the objective truth of &#8216;reality&#8217;. Conceiving of professional journalism as such provides a means of understanding and analysing media production outside of the theoretical bounds of &#8216;ideology critique&#8217;. Empirically, this thesis takes Australian war journalism during the invasion of Iraq, 2003, and professional journalistic discourse observed in interview with a selection of Australian Iraq war correspondents as its object of analysis. Previous analyses and critiques of journalism generally, and war journalism specifically, rely heavily on some conception of journalism as ideological. As this thesis argues this category of analysis is theoretically redundant and the discourse perspective provides a more fecund and insightful critique of journalism. The thesis provides a historical and critical account of professionalism&#8217;s emergence, eventual domination and hegemony of the journalistic field. It is argued that professionalism, as an articulation of social and cultural norms, retains its central cultural legitimacy in journalism, and is expressed through the journalistic norms of objectivity, independence and news values. It is argued that within the contemporary cultural conditions of postmodernism and neo-liberalism these modern norms are no-longer credible and useful in journalism. The empirical analysis of the professional discourse undertaken by the thesis demonstrates journalism as a pragmatic and contingent process of meaning creation, which legitimates and normalises its practices, forms and pre-occupations. In this sense the discourse, as a regime and process of meaning creation, produces its object, or makes war &#8216;real&#8217; for news audiences, rather than reflecting the independent reality of war. In the context of the Iraq invasion, 2003, the thesis reveals many limitations, contradictions and inconsistencies within journalistic norms and subjectivities. The thesis also demonstrates how the discursive needs of professional journalism tend to be coincident with the strategic communication intent of military and political power. This stands in marked contrast to journalism&#8217;s professed normative democratic function and to analyses of war journalism that consider this normative function irresistibly dominated by military and political power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism, war, professionalism, discourse, conflict, media, Iraq, Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Life and Times of Alex Doucas: Migrant and Author: Searching for a new identity</field><field name="creator">Abraham Sophocleous</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis offers the first detailed critical account of the Greek-Australian writer, Alex Doucas (1900-1962) who came to Australia in 1927 as a migrant from Asia Minor. It attempts to place his work in the perspectives of Greek and Australian literatures and to evaluate his position both as a migrant and as a writer. The Asia Minor Catastrophe and the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923, as well as the Great Depression he faced in Australia along with many other Australians had a profound effect on his social outlook. Considered one of the pioneers of Greek-Australian Literature, Doucas played an important role in the development of Greek community life in Australia during the pre- and post-World War II periods. His work consists of two published novels (one posthumously) and a significant body of published and unpublished, stories, poems, translations and essays. Out of print for some decades, it remains largely unknown to the general public or even to academic circles in Greece and in Australia. It was, however, a landmark of Greek-Australian Literature and continues to have more than historical interest in its treatment of migration, exile and displacement, and in its use of intercultural perspectives to forge a positive vision for humanity. Although forced into ill-paid manual labour for much of his life after his arrival in Australia, Alex Doucas tried to develop links and relationships with Australian intellectual circles and to become involved in Australian life in the broadest way. At the same time, he never lost contact with social, political and literary developments in Greece. Alex Doucas maintained close relations with both the Greek and Australian literary traditions. As a writer he belongs to the Greek generation of the 1930s and its literary traditions. In his work, he dealt with events which took place in Anatolia before the Asia Minor Catastrophe as well as with the impact the catastrophe had on Greek society. He is one of the first writers of his generation who turned his attention to the &#8220;other side of the coin&#8221; and investigated the impact of the Catastrophe on the Turkish people. This perspective was adopted mainly due to the openness that he found in Australia, an openness that led to Multiculturalism. Alex Doucas was a multiculturalist before his time. His work is a fine example of the Australian version of Multiculturalism. Through his brother Stratis Doucas (also a writer) and others, he kept himself informed on all sorts of changes and developments in his native country, Greece, especially as it was shaped after the Asia Minor Catastrophe. At the same time, he tried to understand the Australian way of life, its culture and its literary traditions. His bi-cultural position gave him a powerful perspective. He attempted to understand the Australian way of life through his Greekness and to find answers for problematic events that happened in Greece through his Australian experience. Across the entire span of Doucas&#8217;s work, it is clear that his political philosophy and his belief in the goals of socialism played a crucial role in his consciousness of himself as a writer whose role was to provide the artistic equivalent of the philosophical basis of Marxism, best expressed in the Theses on Feuerbach (1845) by Marx, in his famous dictum, "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it". In other words, it was never enough for Doucas simply to describe in social realist terms the conditions of life and the aspirations of human beings. His aim was to show how these conditions might be changed for the better, not only for the individual, but for the community as a whole. Equally, he wished to show how people&#8217;s aspirations, particularly those of an immigrant community familiar with exile, suffering and loss, might be more fully realised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural literature, migrant literature, comparative literature, social realism, asia minor catastrophe, modern greek literature, australian literature, literary traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular Mechanisms of axon guidance and targeting in the olfactory system</field><field name="creator">Man-yee Chan</field><field name="description">Olfactory sensenory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium are located in the nasal cavity and project axons that synapse onto dendrites of second-order neurons within the olfactory bulb in neuropil structures termed glomeruli. Each OSN expresses one of the over 1000 odorant receptors (ORs) and are randomly dispersed across one of the four partially overlapping regions of the olfactory epithelium. OSNs expressing a single OR project their axons to typically two symmetrically bilateral glomeruli, one each on the medial and lateral surfaces of the olfactory bulb. The target choice of the OSN axons appears to depend on a combination of molecular determinants that first promote segregation of axons into broad regions of the olfactory bulb and then favor sorting and convergence into specific glomeruli. The role of ORs has clearly been demonstrated to play a significant role in axon sorting and targeting to the glomeruli, however other guidance molecules have clearly been shown to be required in the precise targeting of the OSN axons. During development of the mouse olfactory system, olfactory sensory axons first contact their terminal zone in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb during late embryonic period and target to their appropriate glomeruli over the next few days. During this period, many axons can branch inappropriately into several glomeruli and overshoot the target layer and enter deeper layers of the olfactory bulb. The aberrant axonal projections are normally detected within the deeper layers of the bulb up to postnatal day 12. By the end of the second postnatal week, axon trajectories are refined and axons over-projections are seldom observed in adult animals. A detailed understanding of the process of axon over-projections enabled the identification of directional cues that navigate the outgrowing axons to their defined destination. There are two aims of the present thesis, first, to investigate the role of cell surface carbohydrates in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying axon navigation in the developing olfactory system. To achieve this aim, transgenic mice expressing two glycosyltransferases (Mgat3 and 5) under the control of OMP promoter to drive expression in all mature OSNs have been generated. The results obtained from these transgenic mice showed that the transgene is expressed based on the ability to detect GFP reporter expression, however no apparent targeting defect in the olfactory pathway was observed from these transgenic mice. The purpose of the second study was twofold: 1) To examine the trajectory of olfactory sensory axons that penetrate past the glomerular layer in OMP-Zsgreen transgenic mice and 2) using in vitro cultures of the olfactory epithelium from OMP-Zsgreen mice which allowed visualization of mature OSN and their axons, together with extract prepared from inner layers of olfactory bulb to elucidate the impact of distinct molecular and cellular cues on defined OSN populations. Our results revealed that targeting of OSN axons was initially imprecise where extensive axons over-projection was observed in early postnatal animals. This targeting error was then refined later in development after the first two postnatal weeks and rarely observed in adult animals. The in vitro study using cultured OE explants to examine the effect of the extract prepared from the inner layers of the olfactory bulb on the axon outgrowth suggests the presence of a repellent activity in the inner layers of the olfactory bulb and that this inibition is stronger in P17.5 animals than P8.5 and P2.5 animals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a scenario-based coral reef ecosystem model to assist management following mass coral mortality events</field><field name="creator">Glen Holmes</field><field name="description">Coral reefs are experiencing increasing levels of stress due to climate change, overfishing, coastal development and nutrient runoff from agriculture to name a few. They are however, economically vital ecosystems in terms of both their income generating capacity and as a source of food for millions of people around the world. This predicament emphasises the need for effective ecosystem management to be able to balance the benefits of coral reefs with the inherent stressors associated with people utilising their resources. It is particularly important given the potential large scale impacts associated with climate change such as mass coral bleaching events. Similarly, much of the need for direct management of coral reefs exists in developing countries where the resources, information, and technology are limited or unavailable for such a task. This places them, in particular, at the high end of management uncertainty and impact vulnerability. Accordingly, there is a pronounced need to improve this capacity to understand coral reef ecosystem function and to use this to better predict the overall systems level outcome of management options. This thesis has sought to improve our understanding of key ecological elements of coral reef ecosystems and to build on this new knowledge to produce a widely applicable ecosystem model that will allow managers to better understand and predict the outcomes of their actions. Coral reef ecosystem behaviour is far from understood in its entirety and there are many facets that require detailed further investigations to be able to more confidently predict ecosystem response to any given disturbance. To enhance the current understanding of coral reef ecosystems prior to the model development, investigations were undertaken into the dynamics of nitrogen on a coral reef following bleaching induced coral mortality. The results showed that the rates of nitrogen fixation on surfaces made available due to a coral mortality event increased dramatically in the three months following coral mortality, potentially acting as a driving force for the ecosystem to pass through a phase shift to algal dominance. Application of these nitrogen dynamics to entire coral reef ecosystems required a methodology for scaling these sub coral colony processes to entire reefs. This scaling issue is particularly pertinent given the improved understanding of the overwhelming significance of micro-scale processes to community dynamics. The surface index (SI) concept, relating the two-dimensional projected area to the three-dimensional area of corals was refined and developed for variations of gross coral morphologies. This allowed for the scaling of nitrogen flux estimates to be made over entire reef systems, enabling the incorporation of these fluxes into an ecosystem scale model. One of the key factors associated with the potential for a coral reef to recover from a mass coral mortality event is the potential for new corals to successfully recruit. The process of coral recovery could potentially be enhanced if recruitment is viable in the immediate aftermath of a mortality event. Although investigations in this area were inconclusive, extensive herbivore action on turf assemblages up to eight months old indicated that recruitment may be inhibited through the high palatability of turf assemblages in this age bracket. Integrating these processes with the many other published dynamics of coral reefs allowed for the development of the dynamic systems model. By constraining the model structure to known relationships between the modelling parameters, the model can be calibrated to replicate the dynamics of any coral reef ecosystem. This allows the model to be applied to systems where limited data and/or resources are available, making it widely implementable in developing countries such as the small island states scattered around the tropics. The model is ideally suited to the adaptive management framework whereby managers can continually assess the potential future outcomes of management interventions. In addition, due to the spatially inexplicit and generic nature of the model, it can be easily adapted and integrated into large scale regional modelling frameworks or combined with other modelling packages such as socio-economic or fisheries models to provide enhanced management packages. The culmination of the targeted research and integration of existing knowledge has allowed for the development of an ecosystem model for coral reefs that can be easily adopted by coral reef managers throughout the world. It is however, by no means a definitive coral reef ecosystem model and there are many facets that can and should continue to be refined to enhance the reliability of the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coral reef</field><field name="subject">ecosystem response</field><field name="subject">ecosystem based management</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">surface area</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">ecological modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Tools for the Assessment of Social Competence in Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Catherine Hynes</field><field name="description">Background: Patients with non-penetrating traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are at high risk for damage to ventral prefrontal brain regions, due to the brain&#8217;s acceleration into the bony ridges of the anterior portions of the skull. Current neuropsychological assessments of these patients focus mainly on the assessment of so-called &#8220;executive functions,&#8221; which are associated with dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Ventral prefrontal pathology is more likely to disrupt social and emotional functions, but assessments of these abilities using objective measurements that require patients to demonstrate their competence are rare. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic social and emotional deficits are common in TBI, and that these difficulties result in significant functional impairments post-injury, making clear the need to develop and use objective assessment tools during clinical neuropsychological assessments. Methods: In the current project, the Global Interpersonal Skills Test (GIST), a questionnaire measure of social skills with both a self-rated and an informant-rated version, was developed, along with three novel or adapted performance-based measures of social and emotional functioning. The first novel measure was the Assessments of Social Context (ASC), a video-based task examining comprehension of social context using non-verbal cues, including the identification of emotions, intensions and positive or negative attitudes of one person towards another. The second task was the Awareness of Interoception Test (AIT), a heartbeat detection paradigm adapted from previous literature that measures participants&#8217; sensitivity to their cardiac function, which is implicated in basic emotional functioning. The third task was the Social Interpretations Task (SIT), an animation-based task adapted from previous literature examining participants&#8217; ability to apply a social interpretation to stimuli that are not inherently social in nature. All novel tasks were developed and piloted with healthy undergraduates. A group of patients with moderate to severe TBI (N = 16), and a group of non-brain damaged controls (N = 16) underwent neuropsychological testing. Standard neuropsychological measures including the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Digit Span and Digit Symbol Coding from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, phonemic (FAS) and semantic fluency (Animals) from the Verbal Fluency Test, and the Trail Making Test, as well as the novel measures to both patients with TBI and controls were administered. The following predictions were made: vi 1) The novel performance-based measures of social abilities would be more sensitive to the presence of moderate and severe TBI than the standard neuropsychological measures of cognition; 2) On the informant version of the GIST, but not the self-report version, patients would have scores than controls; 3) Patients&#8217; performance on the ASC would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this difference would be associated with real-world social skills, measured by the informant-version of the GIST; 4) Patients&#8217; AIT performance would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this would be related to their self-rated emotional changes; 5) Patients&#8217; SIT performance would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this difference would be associated with real-world social skills, again measured by the informant-version of the GIST. Findings: Findings were consistent with these hypotheses: 1) A statistically significant logistic regression revealed that a Social composite variable comprising the ASC, AIT and SIT was more sensitive to the presence of TBI (&#946; = 9.59, p &lt; .05) than a Cognitive composite variable comprising Digit Symbol Coding, Trails B completion time, and Phonemic Fluency (&#946; = 0.006, p = .466). 2) A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that informants of patients gave lower GIST scores to patients than the informants of controls (F(1,28) = 22.2, p &lt; 0.0001), whereas there were no differences between groups on the self-rated version of the GIST (F(1,28) = .35, p = .56); 3) Patients&#8217; ASC performance was significantly poorer than controls&#8217; on a MANOVA (F(1,31) = 21.7, p &lt; .0001), and ASC total scores were significantly correlated with GIST informant scores, using Spearman&#8217;s rank-order correlations (&#961;(31) = .624, p &lt; .0001). 4) Patients&#8217; AIT performance was significantly poorer than controls&#8217; using an independent samples t test (t(13) = 1.43, p &lt; 0.005), and qualitative investigation of subjective reports of emotional change among patients suggested a potential relationship between emotional changes and AIT performance. vii 5) Patients&#8217; SIT performance was significantly poorer than controls on an independent samples t test (t(30) = -2.12, p &lt; 0.05), and SIT scores were significantly correlated with GIST informant scores, using Spearman&#8217;s rank-order correlations (&#961;(31) = .460, p &lt; .0001). Interpretation: This research represents a preliminary step in the development of clinically useful measures of social and emotional difficulties following TBI. Given the small sample size of the patient group, and the presence of co-morbid difficulties among some of the participants in this research, further testing of these measures in larger, more homogeneous samples would strengthen the current results, as would using a comparison group of people with milder TBI, rather than neuro-typical controls. The complexity of social behaviour requires that the current measures be further validated against other real-world assessments of social ability, and that assessments of other aspects of social behaviour be conducted. Nonetheless, the measures described here are a promising start to supplementing the neuropsychological toolkit in an area that requires further development at the present time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">frontal lobe, traumatic brain injury, closed head injury, assessment, neuropsychology, social skills, emotions, executive function, social dysfunction non-verbal behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a continuous encapsulation method in a microfluidic device</field><field name="creator">Edeline Wong</field><field name="description">Delivery of a desired &#8216;active&#8217; compound (for example, starch (as an energy substrate)) to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is most easily achieved by oral administration. Unfortunately, the efficacy of most actives is greatly reduced due to the aggressive nature of digestive enzymes and processes which occur in this environment. A commonly applied strategy to prevent deactivation of the active prior to absorption at the target site is to encapsulate the active in another &#8216;sacrificial&#8217; or non-degradable polymer matrix. Traditionally, the active and matrix is processed into a microparticle format for easy oral delivery (dispersed in a liquid or paste). However, established encapsulation methods which rely on bulk-phase processing to produce these microparticles (e.g. emulsification) are far from ideal as they lack control over the final microparticle size, size distribution, composition and shape. The lack of control in the physical properties of the resultant microparticles in turn results in an inherent lack of control over the kinetics of release of the active at the target site. In contrast, recent advances in microfluidic device fabrication and methodology development have firmly proven that these new generation devices can produce monodisperse droplets and microparticles in a continuous, controllable and predictable manner. Their potential as a processing tool for the production of highly tailored microparticles for targeted delivery, however, remains to be fully explored. Both the physical and chemical (physicochemical) properties of microparticles made from a single polymer system may be altered by the deposition of one or more additional polymer layers onto the microparticle surface (for example, alternating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to produce core-shell like particles), and this method has proven to be favorable with regards to retarding the release of active compounds. However, this addition of alternate layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (so called Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition or assembly) does increase the number of processing steps the particles must undergo prior to storage or delivery. Further, the overall effectiveness of this additional processing is still highly dependent on the properties of the original (core) microparticles. In this thesis, a microfluidic technique was developed to encapsulate starch granules in alginate-based microparticles. Using this continuous technique, the size of the microparticles produced were shown to be monodisperse and reproducible. The developed microfluidic device included a drop formation section, followed by a gelation region and a transfer section, where the particles made on-chip are transferred from the carrier oil phase to an aqueous phase prior to collection. The microparticles collected from this microfluidic device were found to be stable for several weeks and in stark contrast to particles produced via a standard bulk emulsification routes, no aggregation was observed over this time frame. The release profile of glucose (as a result of starch hydrolysation) from microparticles produced using both a standard bulk emulsification method and the developed microfluidic-based method were compared. It was found that the monodisperse particles produced using the microfluidic method showed significantly more retardation to release compared to the glucose release profile from bulk-processed particles. This retardation effect was more pronounced when a thin layer of an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (chitosan) was adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface (alginate is an anionic polyelectrolyte) of the microfluidic-processed microparticle. The microfluidic device developed within this thesis and the resulting tailored microparticles thus show significant potential with regards to offering a new generation of microparticle delivery systems with highly deterministic delivery over extended lifetimes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="subject">microparticles</field><field name="subject">microfabrication</field><field name="subject">Alginate</field><field name="subject">Encapsulation</field><field name="subject">surface patterning</field><field name="subject">release study</field><field name="subject">Rheology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Buddha's Second Renunciation: doubt, groundlessness and autonomy in contemporary Western Buddhism</field><field name="creator">Martin Kovacic</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a major trend (what might be termed a &#8220;post-Buddhism&#8221;) within contemporary Western Buddhist thinking, and hence practice, emphasising the epistemic, existential and ethical autonomy of self as it engages with the Asian Buddhist traditions. Aligning its enquiry with a corresponding hermeneutic of the Buddha&#8216;s biography in his &#8220;second renunciation&#8221; (his social-psychological and praxiological relinquishment of the structures of religious authority) it focuses on the work of contemporary Western dharma teachers Stephen Batchelor, David Loy and Alan Clements. Their respective emphases of agnostic doubt, ontological groundlessness, and existential-ethical autonomy are investigated in turn, alongside a corresponding reading of the Buddha&#8216;s praxis prior to his enlightenment. Of interest to academic Buddhist Studies, this analysis introduces potential re-theorisations of the meta-epistemic nature of Buddhist praxis and the phenomenology of self and Buddhist &#8216;non-self&#8217; as it/they engage with both Buddhist and Derridean deconstructive (contemplative and intellectual) praxis. It also considers a re-contextualisation of Buddhist ethics as it is influenced by the deconstructive and ethical strategies of Derrida and Levinas, as well as a (native but under-explored) Buddhist &#8216;ethics of non-duality.&#8217; (All of these themes might be seen as more or less implicit also in the work of Western Buddhist theorists such as Roger Jackson, John Makransky, Jos&#233; Ignacio Cabez&#243;n, Alan B. Wallace, John Pickering and so on, and their deconstructionist counterparts in John Caputo, Robert Magliola, Steven Laycock, Carl Olson and others.) The thesis concludes with a general theorisation of the newly-inflected models of Buddhist enlightenment, praxiology and ethical engagement that necessarily emerge from such a shift of emphasis: a post-secular, non-hierarchical trans-religious culture of self-determination both within and without tradition. The Buddha&#8216;s enlightenment itself emerges as a heterogeneous culture of human freedoms rather than a form of univocal religious transcendence. Similarly, Batchelor, Loy and Clements&#8217; concerns around authenticity can be seen as productive elements of an evolving model of Buddhism within Western culture: one that in paradoxically grounding itself in &#8216;groundlessness,&#8217; returns to the meta-religious roots of Gotama Buddha&#8216;s own socio-historic transformation of the (religious and other) conditions of his time. Such a transformation becomes characterised by a greater attention to the contingencies of the unique self and its environment, knowledge-acquisition and its constructed character, justice and ethical ambiguity, and the indeterminacy of normative religious claims.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Buddhism, biography of the Buddha, contemplative praxiology, non-dual ontology, Buddhist psychotherapy, deconstruction, post-secularity, Levinasian ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First language influence on second language syntactic processing of English relative clauses</field><field name="creator">Ken-ichi Hashimoto</field><field name="description">Fluent sentence comprehension requires the automatic application of grammatical principles, in combination with other kinds of information, to a linear input string. The latter can vary greatly in complexity, and it has been observed that structures that involve non-adjacent relationships (non-local dependencies) cause particular processing difficulties, for even fluent readers. This thesis focuses on the potential role that L1 transfer plays in processing non-local dependencies in the L2. Although L1 transfer has been demonstrated in a variety of L2 domains (Juffs, 2005), the degree to which L1 syntactic properties influence the L2 in real-time processing remains an open question (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). A better understanding of L1 influence on L2 processing has important implications for emerging models of L2 sentence processing and SLA theory in general. This thesis examines L1 effects on the processing of L2 English relative clauses. It builds on established models of L1 relative clause processing (e.g., Gibson, 1998) and focuses on the asymmetry observed in the processing of subject versus object relative clauses. Research has shown that L1 individuals find object relative clauses more difficult to process than their subject counterparts (King &amp; Just, 1991), and off-line L2 research suggests that this asymmetry might hold for L2 processing as well (Izumi, 2003; Kanno, 2007). This thesis will examine the asymmetry on-line and investigate the role that L1 background plays in on-line performance, both alone and in combination with other processing factors. The main data are on-line performance by three groups of advanced-level learners of L2 English from Japan, China, and Vietnam. The three L1s differ from English to varying degrees in relative clause formation, as reflected in head direction, branching direction and the presence of an overt relative marker. Vietnamese shares all three properties with English and Japanese none, leading to the prediction that the Japanese learners will have the greatest difficulty, as evident in the largest subject/object asymmetry in processing times. Evidence for the effect of L1 syntactic properties on L2 processing will be sought in a set of studies that compare processing outcomes for these learners across key individual difference factors in L2 processing, working memory capacity, lexical processing efficiency, and proficiency. The effect of non-structural information, in the form of animacy contrasts and frequency effects, on L2 syntactic processing across the L1 groups will also be examined. By systematically examining group differences across these key factors, the degree and nature of potential L1 influence on the processing of these non-local dependencies can be better assessed. Three groups of advanced-level L2 English learners from China, Japan, and Vietnam, a group of intermediate-level learners in Japan, and native English controls participated in the data collection. Participants were first tested on a battery of individual difference measures that established language proficiency and general processing skill for individual participants and groups. On-line reading data of relative clause structures were then collected and reported in a set of five studies. Study 1 examined reading when the target structures contained high frequency content words, which minimized word recognition demands. Advanced L2 learners took longer to read object relative clauses, and the difference was the greatest for the Japanese group. Study 2 revealed that the subject/object asymmetry and L1 influence evident in Study 1 disappeared when word recognition was effortful, as in sentences with low frequency words, suggesting that L1 syntactic influence may only be evident when lexical processing is relatively automatic. Study 3 examined the effect of proficiency differences on processing outcomes by comparing performance by Intermediate and Advanced Japanese learners. The Intermediate learners showed no subject/object asymmetry in sentences with high frequency words, providing further evidence that processing efficiency is a key factor when considering possible L1 effects in L2 processing. Study 4 demonstrated that advanced L2 learners benefited from animacy cues in on-line processing, with the difficulty associated with object relative sentences and the L1 effect evident in sentences with animate head nouns neutralized in sentences with inanimate head nouns. The findings indicate that L2 learners may rely on lexical information as an alternative to syntactic knowledge in some cases. Finally, Study 5 compared processing performance on full or reduced relative clauses to examine both the influence of L1 syntactic properties and L1 structural frequency biases on L2 processing outcomes. Although the influence of frequency information was not evident, the results suggested that the availability of an overt relative marker in the L1 affected L2 processing outcomes. Overall, the results provide some support for the view that L1 background influences the processing of complex syntactic structures in the L2, a finding consistent with Juffs (2005) but contrary to Clahsen et al. (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). However, the effect is sensitive to a range of factors, which appears to support the claim by the latter that L2 learners may rely more on lexical-semantic information than L1 individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relative clause</field><field name="subject">syntactic processing</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer</field><field name="subject">L2 processing</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">word recognition</field><field name="subject">proficiency</field><field name="subject">animacy</field><field name="subject">structural frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of higher education for knowledge on and for Africa: A historical critique</field><field name="creator">Adelino Chissale</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the ways in which higher education in Africa has been construing its mission for Africa&#8217;s development and how such constructions are shaped by particular global regimes of knowledge on development. The thesis unpacks the ways in which such regimes are deployed using specific technologies: neo-liberal precepts on economic development. To that end, I pose a set of questions which can be summarized in these two: How has higher education in Africa discursively construed Africa&#8217;s experiences? Second, in which terms such constructions have helped responding to Africa&#8217;s problems of development? Taking Mozambican higher education as a unit of analysis, I used postcolonial theory to unsettle neo-liberal regimes of development and to show how contingent they are. Methodologically, a historical critique was carried out to historize neo-liberal globalization as a contingent process and to understand multiple possibilities of construing Africa&#8217;s experiences. My data consisted of texts discussing ways in which Africa is discursively understood by both, African and Western scholarship, higher education policy in Mozambique, interviews with senior administrators of some Mozambican higher education institutions and text materials from higher education institutions&#8217; websites in Mozambique. The findings suggest that, on the one hand, constructions of Africa as being in crisis are not new. In fact, for centuries Africa has always been a subject of knowledge from which the West constructs its differences. It is from such differences that the West assumed a civilizing mission in order to integrate African peoples in the world order. On the other hand, African scholars&#8217; responses to Western constructions of Africa&#8217;s experiences end up building another crisis at the theoretical level: the difficulties of thinking effectively on Africa so as to solve its problems. The second finding is that Mozambican higher education&#8217;s responses to the crisis have been marked by a development agenda within the broader context of Mozambique&#8217;s history from late the 1970s onwards: first, within the socialist model of central planning economy and, second, within the international agenda of global neo-liberal market economy. My analysis suggests that both development practices reflect, to some extent, continuities of colonial regimes of development which did not take into account the contextualities of the colonized. Finally, my investigation found that higher education institutions in Mozambique are responding to development challenges based on very technological conceptions of development following global trends. The thesis contends that an engagement with the ethics of knowledge and development would lead to a development model more preoccupied with the social contexts beyond market rationalities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Africa, developmentalist discourses, higher education, historical critique, neo-liberal globalization, postcolonial theory, post-independent Mozambique, regimes of knowledge.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hartz revisited: German liberalism and the fragment cultures of 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland</field><field name="creator">Christopher Herde</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of the relationship between migrants&#8217; ideology and the dominant political culture in their host country, exploring what happened to German liberal migrant politicians in 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland. It does this by using Louis Hartz&#8217;s fragment theory which he developed in The Liberal Tradition in America and The Founding of New Societies. Hartz argues that the crucial factor in the political development of the new settler new societies was the migration of a fragment of European society bound by a common Weltanschauung or world view. In the United States, Hartz identifies the relevant group as the Puritans who fled Britain in the 17th century, and whose Calvinism he links to Lockean liberalism. Hartz and his collaborator Richard Rosecrance, who wrote the Australian section of New Societies, argue Australia was shaped by the lower-middle and working-class migrant fragment, inspired by political reform movement in England, and who arrived in the first half of the 19th century armed with a utilitarian-radical ideology. With no strong opposition these fragments congeal without reference to Europe and stagnate into monolithic political cultures where all the disparate elements merge into a broad - although at times quarrelsome &#8211; national consensus. According to Hartz, this consensus is re-enforced by the individualist capitalism of The American Dream or the radical collectivism of The Australian Legend &#8211; which become the foundation of the two nations&#8217; respective national character. Hartz acknowledges that the new migrant from Europe is a constant threat to this political-cultural status quo. However, he says by &#8220;consciously articulating the fragment ethic&#8221;, the new migrant is absorbed, keeping in check the ideological challenges inherent in migration. This thesis argues that, in the case of the German liberals, who left their homeland in the 1840s and 1850s, the process was more complex than the one Hartz describes. In Wisconsin, German liberalism was most aligned to Jeffersonian democracy and the Germans either rejected outright or never fully embraced other strands within the political consensus such as Puritan moralism, Jacksonian democracy and Hamiltonian federalism. In Queensland their German liberalism was most compatible with utilitarianism and the Germans rejected most elements of classical liberalism, the evangelical element within social liberalism and the working-class radicalism of the Labor Party. They accepted Jeffersonian democracy and utilitarianism in their respective new homes because they were closest to their core German liberal principles of secularism, the primacy of the rule of law, romanticism, opposition to the aristocracy, and an aversion to rampant capitalism. Most important, however, were their attitudes towards the Staat and Volk. The Staat was both as a potential enemy and also a vital ally in liberal reform and the Volk were seen as potential colleagues in a liberal state but also as a danger to stability. Over the course of their careers they ideologically realigned, leaving parties and factions whenever challenged and using their German liberal ideals as their political reference point.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Louis Hartz, Queensland, Wisconsin, 19th century, US political culture, Australian political culture, fragment, German liberalism, migration, political history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chondrichthyans and the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery: Bycatch reduction, biology, conservation status and sustainability</field><field name="creator">Peter Kyne</field><field name="description">The chondrichthyan (shark, batoid and holocephalan) bycatch of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (ECTF) was examined through a series of fishery-independent trawl surveys, together with fishery-dependent (opportunistic) sampling. Project aims were to document the chondrichthyan bycatch composition in order to test the effectiveness of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), to examine biological aspects of bycatch species, and to combine data collected through these parts to assess the conservation status and sustainability of bycatch species. A total of 37 chondrichthyan species (one holocephalan, 19 batoids and 17 sharks) from 18 families were recorded in the bycatch of the fishery. The most speciose families recorded were the stingrays (Dasyatidae; 7 species), the requiem sharks (Carcharhinidae; 5 species), the catsharks (Scyliorhinidae; 4 species) and the stingarees (Urolophidae; 3 species). Chondrichthyan bycatch was highly variable between fishery sectors; catch rates were low in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector (north Queensland; 0.02&#8211;0.12 individuals ha-1 trawled) and in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector (southern Queensland; 0.08 individuals ha-1 trawled), intermediate in Hervey Bay (southern Queensland; 0.25 individuals ha-1 trawled) and in the scallop sector (central Queensland coast; 0.31 individuals ha-1 trawled) and highest in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector (southern Queensland; 0.96 individuals ha-1 trawled). Chondrichthyan bycatch in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector was dominated by the three batoids Aptychotrema rostrata, Trygonoptera testacea and Urolophus kapalensis (~92% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector by the skate Dipturus polyommata and the two catsharks Asymbolus rubiginosus and Figaro boardmani (~83% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the scallop sector by the three batoids A. rostrata, Neotrygon kuhlii and Neotrygon picta (~91% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), and in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector by the two batoids Himantura astra and Gymnura australis and the two sharks Chiloscyllium punctatum and Hemigaleus australiensis (~67% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number). The testing of TEDs and BRDs, which are mandatory throughout the fishery, demonstrated only a limited ability to reduce chondrichthyan bycatch in the ECTF, which is comprised mainly of relatively small species. The shorter trawl durations of the surveys compared with normal commercial activities may have under-represented larger species. No significant reductions in chondrichthyan bycatch were found using a TED and a radial escape section BRD in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector, using a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector, or using a TED and a fisheye BRD in Hervey Bay. There was however, a significant difference in the probability of capturing the group &#8216;sharks and guitarfishes&#8217; (comprised largely of A. rostrata) between codend types in the scallop sector, with the lowest probability of capture in nets fitted with both a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD (the difference was largely attributed to the effects of the TED). In the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector, in which three different BRDs were trialed (fisheye, square-mesh codend, square-mesh panel), the probability of capturing chondrichthyans was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD than in the standard (control) net, and the probability of capturing batoids was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD or with a square-mesh codend BRD than in the standard (control) net. The small sample size of chondrichthyan catches in some sectors may have reduced to power to detect bycatch reduction. The biology of several bycatch species from the families Rajidae, Rhinobatidae, Urolophidae and Scyliorhinidae was examined. For D. polyommata, size at birth was estimated at ~100&#8211;110 mm total length (LT), size at first feeding at ~105&#8211;110mm LT, size at 50% maturity (LT50 and 95% CI) at 321 (305&#8211;332) mm LT for females and 300 (285&#8211;306) mm LT for males. Diet (described by the index of relative importance as a percentage) was predominantly crustacean based, with carid shrimps (53.6%) and penaeoid prawns (23.3%) being the most significant prey groups. For A. rostrata, size at birth was estimated at &lt;170 mm LT, size at 50% maturity (LT50 and 95% CI) at 640 (618&#8211;663) mm LT for females and 597 (551&#8211;649) mm LT for males, and litter size was 9&#8211;20 (n = 9; mean &#177; S.E. = 15.1 &#177; 1.2). For T. testacea, size at birth was estimated at 77&#8211;100 mm disc width (WD), size at 50% maturity (WD50 and 95% CI) at 163 (156&#8211;169) mm WD for females and 146 (140&#8211;150) mm WD for males, and litter size was always one (n = 6). For U. kapalensis, size at birth was estimated at 75&#8211;100 mm WD, size at 50% maturity (WD50 and 95% CI) at 154 (145&#8211;160) mm WD for females and 155 (149&#8211;159) mm WD for males, and litter size was always one (n = 16). The catsharks A. analis, A. rubiginosus and F. boardmani were all confirmed as single oviparous species (carrying only one egg case in each uterus at one time). Ovarian fecundity (the number of vitellogenic follicles) averaged 13.6 (range 13&#8211;20) in A. analis, 13.5 (range 5&#8211;23) in A. rubiginosus and 10.4 (range 9&#8211;13) in F. boardmani. While only limited data were available from southern Queensland, several indicators suggest that Asymbolus catsharks are reproductively active year-round. A general lack of small-sized or immature catsharks captured during the study made assessments of size at maturity difficult for these species. The conservation status of ECTF bycatch species was examined through the application of the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM Categories and Criteria, which considers extinction risk at the global level. Of the 24 ECTF chondrichthyan bycatch species evaluated against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, four have been assessed globally as Vulnerable (a threatened category indicating that a species is &#8216;facing a high risk of extinction in the wild&#8217;), seven as Near Threatened, 11 as Least Concern and two as Data Deficient. While the four globally threatened species (A. nichofii, Heteroscyllium colcloughi, Rhynchobatus australiae and Urolophus sufflavus) were only minor components of the ECTF bycatch, their global conservation status warrants that fisheries management and industry should act to ensure minimal impacts on these species. An ecological risk assessment method (Susceptibility-Recovery Analysis) was used to assess the relative sustainability or risk of individual species to the fishing activities of the ECTF. Two separate approaches were taken to the technique, which considers sustainability to be dependent on the susceptibility of a species to the fishery and the recovery potential of a species after depletion by fishing activities. The first approach applied the precautionary principal when data were lacking for the calculation of recovery attributes, while the second used biological data from similar species when species-specific data were lacking. The precautionary approach tended to overestimate risk to poorly known oviparous species. The biological approach suggested that A. nichofii, F. boardmani, Rhizoprionodon acutus, Rhizoprionodon taylori and Rhynchobatus palpebratus face the least risk (i.e. were the most sustainable) while several medium-large batoids and the sharks Loxodon macrorhinus and Heteroscyllium colcloughi were the species most at risk (i.e. least sustainable). Demonstrating ecological sustainability of the ECTF will need to be a continued management objective into the future. To further improve the ecological sustainability of the fishery in relation to sharks, batoids and holocephalans, a number of management recommendations are proposed: (1) give warranted conservation consideration to listed threatened species as well as species identified as being at risk; (2) expand required logbook information on chondrichthyan species to include recording of catches of these species; (3) encourage safe release practices for all chondrichthyans to maximise survivorship of discards; (4) initiate research into the survivorship of discards; (5) ensure long-term observer coverage on commercial vessels to monitor bycatch levels; and, (6) test and quantify reduced TED bar spacings (presently 120 mm) in fishery sectors which show the highest chondrichthyan bycatch levels, that is, the eastern king prawn (shallow water) and scallop sectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bycatch</field><field name="subject">trawl</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyan</field><field name="subject">elasmobranch</field><field name="subject">turtle exclusion device</field><field name="subject">bycatch reduction device</field><field name="subject">ecological risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary Australian Political Satire: Newspaper Cartoonists as Public Intellectuals</field><field name="creator">Amanda Roe</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the role that Australian graphic satirists play in the theatre of public life. The main focus of the thesis is on newspaper cartoonists but for the purposes of comparative analysis, there is a discussion of a representative selection of satiric texts across different media (essentially, television and radio) since the mid-1960s, and also an historical survey of the development of graphic satire from its origins during the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Apart from a small number of references, this study does not venture into the vast field of on-line satire, a topic more properly addressed in a separate scholarly investigation. Graphic satire in the medium of the newspaper is of particular interest because of its consistent production and wide circulation, its relative freedom from censorship and libel laws, and the ability of the cartoon image to condense and concentrate issues which would be too complex or defamatory in print or on television. Political cartooning as it is understood today emerged during the early nineteenth century, at about the same time as the modern newspaper and the profession of journalism, but graphic satire also has links with a venerable tradition of the artist as social critic and has historically been associated with movements for social justice and democracy. It is in the context of these latter associations that I consider political cartoonists as belonging to the sphere of the public intellectual. The discussion of cartoonists as public intellectuals is framed against a discourse of decline that has been circulating for more than a decade, acquiring an urgency in this country during the later years of the Howard administration. This declinist narrative covers a number of areas of cultural and political life and is not confined to the Australian context; as British writer Helen Small points out, it is &#8220;an increasingly transnational conversation&#8221; (02:1). Briefly outlined, there is a perception that the terms of public debate have narrowed; that citizens have become disengaged from the democratic process; that between the &#8216;celebrity intellectual&#8217; and the tenured academic, the life of the mind is not what it used to be, and even political satire itself has been seen by some commentators as being in terminal decline. The different arguments about cultural and social decline can be placed under the more encompassing subject heading of an ongoing debate about democracy and in particular, whether it is functioning as well as it should. With the adoption of neo-liberalism as an overarching political ideology by most western governments in the early 1980s, anxieties about whether the principles of democracy were gradually being usurped or even eroded by the primacy of market values have gathered momentum during the past two decades. The volume of these concerns has been amplified in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent &#8216;war on terror&#8217;, with the state&#8217;s increased emphasis on security and control of its citizens being interpreted as threats to some of the basic tenets of the democratic system, such as free speech and the rule of law. In contrast to the various narratives of decline, my thesis proposes that democracy is still very well served by the kind of vigorous and long-standing practice of dissent that the public intellectual represents, and more specifically, the embodiment of this tradition in contemporary newspaper cartoonists. By definition, graphic satire questions and challenges the status quo and at least since Hogarth in the eighteenth century, it has always been a public art-form. Hogarth&#8217;s personal involvement in many of the social issues and philanthropic schemes of his day (such as anti-gin legislation and state care for orphans) also exemplifies an important aspect of the extra-professional work of graphic satirists which further links them to the public intellectual. A commitment to social activism and making use of the different platforms available (for example, public speaking and donating work to charities) in order to support, publicise or promote issues of social justice began with Hogarth and continues with contemporary Australian cartoonists.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian politics, satire, cartoonists, media, art history, public intellectuals, dissent, democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropsychological Assessment of Recovery after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Karleigh Kwapil</field><field name="description">Mild Traumatic Brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most common forms of acquired neurological damage. However, the term 'mild' TBI is misleading because the physical, cognitive and emotional impairments that can follow from mTBI can be significant. In order to provide objective, prognostic measures for diagnosing the severity of mTBI and identifying individuals who may be at risk for poor outcomes a battery of neuropsychological measures for detecting cognitive impairment was evaluated. The Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) is a collection of tests assessing verbal recall, orientation, processing speed and speed of language comprehension. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RSC has acceptable reliability, validity and sensitivity to cognitive impairment that arises during the acute stages of injury. However, no studies have investigated the predictive validity of this instrument. Moreover it is unclear what additional patient or post injury variables could assist in identifying those individuals who may be at risk of poor neuropsychological outcomes following mTBI. These were among the main issues that were addressed across the five empirical studies in this thesis. A pragmatic, prospective, longitudinal and cross-sectional study of the sequelae of mTBI in patients presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Royal Brisbane and Women's hospital was the basis of this project. The first empirical chapter (chapter 2), examined the psychometric properties of two measures of verbal learning and memory and investigated their potential for discriminating between mTBI and orthopaedic controls. The performance of 93 patients with mTBI and 68 participants with orthopaedic injuries was analysed to identify the number of individuals who performed at ceiling on the Hopkins Verbal Learning test (HVLT-R) versus a 5-word test of immediate and delayed recall. While both of these verbal recall measures were effective in separating the mTBI and orthopaedic groups, overall, the HVLT-R was shown to be a more suitable measure for screening for deficits in verbal learning and memory after mTBI. Given the superiority of the HVLT-R as a measure of verbal learning and memory, chapter 3 aimed to examine whether inclusion of this test could improve the sensitivity of the RSC in mTBI compared to orthopaedic and uninjured control samples. Results were generally within the direction predicted. Significant differences were found between groups on the majority of cognitive indices assessed. Both the orthopaedic and mTBI group performed more poorly than the uninjured group on all measures except the Hopkins delayed recognition. Additional performance decrements shown by the mTBI group compared to the orthopaedic group illustrate that factors beyond the general effects of trauma influence performance and may be related to cognitive impairment specific to sustaining mTBI. Overall it was concluded that the revised RSC is a sensitive instrument deserving investigation in assessing the more long term cognitive effects following mTBI. Chapter 4 applied this sensitive battery for investigation of group and individual recovery of neuropsychological test performance and post-concussive symptom reporting up to 3-months after mTBI. A sample of 30 mTBI participants and 30 uninjured controls were serially assessed on cognitive measures and symptom report scales immediately after injury and after 1-week, 1-month and 3-months. Symptom reporting on the Rivermead post-concussive inventory separated the mTBI and control groups after 1-week but diagnostic accuracy was no greater than chance at 1 and 3-months. In contrast the mTBI group performed more poorly than controls on measures on neuropsychological measures acutely, at 1-week and 1-month, with group differences still evident after 3-months. Nonethless, a trend of progressive recovery over time was seen in the mTBI group. In chapter 5, criteria utilising the concepts of reliable and statistically significant change were applied to the data. Overall, 73% of mTBI patients were impaired on one or more tests acutely. Significant recovery was demonstrated by 20% of mTBI participants by 3-months; however recovery remained incomplete for half of the mTBI participants by 3-months. These results highlighted the importance of an individual approach to the assessment of mTBI and support the notion that a proportion of mTBI cases may have protracted difficulties. Chapter 6 extended these findings by showing that the RSC has prognostic ability. It was found that acute neuropsychological performance on the RSC was a significant predictor of performance on an extended battery at 3-months. The final chapter provides a general discussion and synthesis of the findings. In summary, the present dissertation demonstrated that inclusion of a sensitive measure of verbal recall led to improved diagnostic validity of the RSC. Neuropsychological measures rather than symptom reporting were sensitive in detecting cognitive impairment at 3-months. Analysis of individuals showed that up to 50% of the group had failed to &#8211; demonstrate reliable recovery &#8211; that is, make improvements over and above practice effects after 3-months. Finally, acute neuropsychological performance was predictive of long term performance. Overall, the present thesis has identified a short battery of tests that is suitable for assessment of mTBI within 24 hours and may assist in identifying individuals at risk of poor cognitive outcomes after mTBI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Concussion</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological assessment</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological recovery</field><field name="subject">post concussion syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRCA1, Kap1 and the DNA Damage Response</field><field name="creator">Kienan Savage</field><field name="description">Cancer cells exhibit genomic instability and are commonly defective in DNA damage signalling and/or DNA repair. There are many types of DNA damage inducing agents such as mechanical stress on chromosomes during recombination, chemotherapeutics, ionising and ultraviolet radiation and endogenously produced free radicals. These genetic lesions pose a serious threat to the cell and evoke a rapid and intricate DNA damage response signalling pathway involving many transducer and effector pathways including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, chromatin remodelling, and apoptotic pathways. Genetic mutations within genes in this pathway often lead to genomic instability and cancer. The main effectors of the DNA damage response are the protein kinases ATM and ATR which are rapidly activated in response to DNA damage induction and phosphorylate a large and diverse number of targets including the checkpoint kinases Chk1, and Chk2, the tumour suppressors p53 and BRCA1 and chromatin associated proteins such as H2AX. BRCA1 is a key transducer molecule within the DNA damage response. This is evident from its loss, which leads to defects in many damage response processes such as cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. BRCA1s binding partner BARD1 has also been implicated in the DNA damage response and recent reports indicate that these proteins co-operate in this pathway. This study utilises a multifaceted approach to further characterise the function of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex within the DNA damage response. Firstly we have used shRNA to deplete the BRCA1/BARD1 complex and have shown that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is required for ATM/ATR dependent phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 in response to IR and UV induced DNA damage. In contrast, we have shown that the phosphorylation of a number of other ATM/ATR dependent targets including H2AX, Chk2, and c-jun do not require the BRCA1/BARD1 complex. The study has also revealed that the prior phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 is required for the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. Furthermore, we have shown that these phosphorylation events are required for IR induced G1/S cell cycle arrest via transcriptional induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The second part of this study involved the characterisation of a putative BRCA1 interacting protein &#8211; The KRAB associated protein 1 (Kap1). During this study we have been unable to confirm Kap1 as a bona fide BRCA1 interactor, however we have identified a clear role for Kap1 in the DNA damage response pathway. Using Mass spectrometric phospho amino acid mapping we have identified a novel Chk2 dependent phosphorylation site, Ser-473, within Kap1. Furthermore, we have shown that this phosphorylation event may regulate Histone H3-Lys-9 acetylation after DNA damage possibly regulating chromatin relaxation. This study has also identified a number of novel Kap1 interacting proteins, which appear to be regulated by Kap1 phosphorylation at Ser-473. These interactors may play an important role in the regulation of chromatin modification and/or structure after DNA damage. By studying the role of BRCA1 in the DNA damage response pathway we have not only uncovered a novel scaffolding function for BRCA1 in the G1/S checkpoint but have also identified a novel protein, Kap1, acting within the DNA damage response pathway. This study has identified a role for Kap-1 in the regulation of chromatin structure in response to DNA damage via the ATM &#8211; Chk2 pathway.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BRCA1, BARD1, Kap1, ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, DNA Damage.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Group opinion change and reintegration of deviant group members</field><field name="creator">Khai Huei Chan</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigates two theoretically novel processes of change in groups relevant to agents for change. Specifically, it examines the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on group members&#8217; evaluation of ingroup change-agents. Group opinion change is operationalized as the group adopting the position advocated by a change-agent, and reintegration is operationalized as the group responding more positively towards a change-agent. These formulations of change processes within groups extend past theorizing in opinion deviance research (e.g., Festinger, 1950; Schachter, 1951; Marques &amp; Paez, 1994) by a) examining how contextual differences that result from changes in the group may affect group members&#8217; reactions to opinion deviates, and b) considering contingencies that result in acceptance or rejection of change-agents and their messages. In addition, this thesis investigates the psychological processes that may mediate and moderate the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on appraisals of change-agents. Specifically, it considers attributed motives of change-agents (i.e., perceived constructiveness; Hornsey, 2005), and target prototypicality (e.g., Hogg, 1993; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987) as two possible mediators of these novel effects. Finally, group members&#8217; identification with the group is examined as a moderator of these processes. Chapter 3 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of group opinion change on the evaluation of change-agents. Experiment 1 (N=100) was a scenario-based study that had a change-agent express a non-conformist view of giving water to an outgroup state at a time when the ingroup state was experiencing a water crisis. Experiment 2 (N=103) was a scenario-based study that looked at a change-agent who expressed pro-immigration views to the ingroup country at an earlier time when popular attitudes toward immigration were poor. In both experiments the deviants were marginalized initially because they endorsed non-conformist opinions. Depending on the condition, group opinions either shifted toward the positions advocated by the deviants or remained unchanged. Results showed group members&#8217; target evaluations shifted as a function of group opinion change. Target evaluations became less favourable in Experiment 1, and more favourable in Experiment 2. There also was evidence that increased perceived constructiveness mediated more favourable target evaluations in Experiment 2. Chapter 4 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of reintegration and group members&#8217; identification on the evaluation of change-agents. Both Experiments 3 (N=103) and 4 (N=94) involved a scenario where there was a severe drought in the ingroup state. In Experiment 3, a deviant politician argued for more investment on water infrastructure 10 years earlier when water shortage was not a critical problem. Thus, the politician expressed a minority opinion. In Experiment 4, a deviant water commissioner expressed a controversial opinion to give water to an outgroup state at the height of the drought. Both deviants were marginalized/excluded initially by the group. Reintegration was manipulated by showing that popular support for the deviant had increased (Experiment 3) or the deviant was reinstated (Experiment 4), or the group did not increase support for the deviant at all (not reintegrated). Results showed that high identifiers evaluated the deviant less positively, and perceived the deviant as more destructive after he or she was reintegrated than when marginalization continued. Further, perceived destructiveness mediated the effects of reintegration and identification on trait evaluations. Experiment 4 also showed that high identifiers were less willing to support change after the deviant was reintegrated, than when marginalization continued. Finally, Chapter 5 tested the interactive effects of group opinion change and reintegration on evaluation of change-agents. I also assessed group members&#8217; responses to change-agents in light of the group&#8217;s resistance to change even though the change-agents were right and the groups were wrong. Experiment 5 was a scenario-based study in a minimal-groups situation that had a deviant arguing for a more equitable research funding than the existing distribution. Experiment 6 was a scenario-based study on the disagreement between Galileo Galilei and the Catholic Church on planetary motion. Again, the deviants initially were marginalized by the groups. For opinion change, the groups either adopted or rejected the deviants&#8217; opinions. For reintegration, the groups either treated the deviants more favourably or continued to reject them. Results showed that either opinion change or reintegration was sufficient to defuse negativity towards the deviants. More importantly, group members continued mistreating the deviants when the groups rejected opinion change and reintegration. That is, negativity towards the deviants was highest when opinion was unchanged, and marginalization continued. Overall, this thesis shows that group members&#8217; evaluations of deviant agents for change can shift as a function of group opinion change and reintegration. Group opinion change and/or reintegration defuse negativity toward change-agents in the absence of psychological threat (i.e., perceived destructiveness). However, if threat is present, opinion change or reintegration may ironically elicit more group members&#8217; negativity towards these targets. This thesis also contributes to the literature by showing how change promotes or inhibits group members&#8217; endorsement of change-agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Deviance</field><field name="subject">Dissent</field><field name="subject">Group Opinion change</field><field name="subject">Deviant Reintegration</field><field name="subject">Rejection</field><field name="subject">Threat</field><field name="subject">Criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineered Surfaces for Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering</field><field name="creator">Peter George</field><field name="description">The interaction of materials with biological systems is of critical importance to a vast number of applications from medical implants, tissue engineering scaffolds, blood-contacting devices, cell-culture products, as well as many other products in industries as diverse as agriculture. This thesis describes a method for the modification of biomaterial surfaces and the generation of tissue engineering scaffolds that utilises the self assembly of poly (styrene)-block-poly (ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) block copolymers. Block copolymers consist of alternating segments of two or more chemically distinct polymers. The salient feature of these materials is their ability to self organise into a wide range of micro-phase separated structures generating patterned surfaces that have domain sizes in the order of 10-100nm. Further, it is also possible to specifically functionalise only one segment of the block copolymer, providing a means to precisely locate specific biological signals within the 10-100nm domains of a nano-patterned surface, formed via the programmed micro-phase separation of the block copolymer system. The density and spatial location of signalling molecules can be controlled by altering several variables, such as block length, block asymmetry, as well as processing parameters, providing the potential to authentically emulate the cellular micro to nano-environment and thus greatly improving on existing biomaterial and tissue engineering technologies. This thesis achieved several aims as outlined below; Developed methods to control the self-assembly of PS-PEO block copolymers and generate nano-patterned surfaces and scaffolds with utility for biomaterials applications. PS-PEO diblock copolymers were blended with polystyrene (PS) homopolymer and spin cast, resulting in the rapid self-assembly of vertically oriented PEO cylinders in a matrix of PS. Due to the kinetically constrained phase-separation of the system, increasing addition of homopolymer is shown to reduce the diameter of the PEO domains. This outcome provides a simple method that requires the adjustment of a single variable to tune the size of vertically oriented PEO domains between 10-100nm. Polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering were manufactured via a method that combines macro-scale temperature induced phase separation with micro-phase separation of block copolymers. The phase behaviour of these polymer-solvent systems is described, and potential mechanisms leading to this spectacular structure formation are presented. The result is highly porous scaffolds with surfaces comprised of nano-scale self-assembled block copolymer domains, representing a significant advance in currently available technologies. Characterised the properties of these unique nano-structured materials as well as their interaction with proteinaceous fluids and cells. Nano-patterned PS-PEO self-assembled surfaces showed a significant reduction in protein adsorption compared to control PS surfaces. The adhesion of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells was shown to be significantly affected by the surface coverage of PEO nano-domains formed by copolymer self-assembly. These nano-islands, when presented at high number density (almost 1000 domains per square micron), were shown to completely prevent cellular attachment, even though small amounts of protein were able to bind to the surface. In order to understand the mechanism by which these surfaces resisted protein and cellular adsorption we utilised neutron reflection to study their solvation and swelling properties. The results indicate that the PEO domains are highly solvated in water; however, the PEO chains do not extend into the solvent but remain in their isolated domains. The data supports growing evidence that the key mechanism by which PEO prevents protein adsorption is the blocking of protein adsorption sites. Control the nano-scale presentation of cellular adhesion and other biological molecules via the self-assembly of functionalised PS-PEO block copolymers Precise control over the nano-scale presentation of adhesion molecules and other biological factors represents a new frontier for biomaterials science. Recently, the control of integrin spacing and cellular shape has been shown to affect fundamental biological processes, including differentiation and apoptosis. We present the self-assembly of maleimide functionalised PS-PEO copolymers as a simple, yet highly precise method for controlling the position of cellular adhesion molecules. By controlling the phase separation of the functional PS-PEO block copolymer we alter the nano-scale (on PEO islands of 8-14 nm in size) presentation of the adhesion peptide, GRGDS, decreasing lateral spacing from 62 nm to 44 nm and increasing the number density from ~ 450 to ~ 900 islands per um2. The results indicate that the spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts increases as the spacing between islands of RGD binding peptides decreases. Further, the same functional PS-PEO surfaces were utilised to immobilise poly-histidine tagged proteins and ECM fragments. The technologies developed in this thesis aim to improve on several weaknesses of existing biomaterials, in particular, directing cellular behaviour on surfaces, and within tissue engineering scaffolds, but also, on the prevention of fouling of biomaterials via non-specific protein adsorption. The application of block copolymer self-assembly for biomaterial and tissue engineering systems described in this thesis has great potential as a platform technology for the investigation of fundamental cell-surface and protein-surface interactions as well as for use in existing and emerging biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Block copolymer</field><field name="subject">polystyrene-block-poly (ethylene oxide)</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnolgy</field><field name="subject">Surface Modification</field><field name="subject">Protein Adsorption</field><field name="subject">cell spreading</field><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">integrin</field><field name="subject">RGD</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Islamic Conceptualisations of Press Freedom in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Nerawi Sedu</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the conceptions of press freedom from the Islamic perspective. It examined how certain segments of Malaysian society, including government officers, religious leaders, members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of political parties, perceive press freedom in their country. Compared to previous studies on media freedom or press freedom in Malaysia, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of variables significantly related to the conceptualisation and practice of press freedom, which include economic development, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and globalisation. One significant difference between this study and previous studies was the specific examination of Islamic conceptions of press freedom, which represents a major contribution to existing knowledge. As Malaysia is a complex multi-racial and multi-religious nation, factors such as national ideologies and cultural values were addressed when examining conceptions of press freedom. Due to the focus of the study, two types of framework were utilised: an Islamic theoretical framework and media theories developed by Western scholars. Methodologically, this study employed an ethnographic approach for analysing Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom. A combination of three qualitative research techniques - in-depth face-to-face interviews, examination of archival documents, and personal observations - was utilised to investigate the issues identified in relation to perceptions of press freedom in Malaysia. In-depth face-to-face interviews involved the participation of staff and members from ten organisations and individuals who were not affiliated with these organisations. The organisations involved in this study were: Ministry of Internal Security Malaysia (MOIS); Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (IKIM); Islamic Da&#8217;wah Foundation Malaysia (YADIM); Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM); Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM); Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ); Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM); Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS), People&#8217;s Justice Party (PKR); and Puteri UMNO. The archival documents analysed in this study were gathered from these ten organisations. However, due to certain organisational policies and security concerns, personal observations were only conducted at eight organisations, IKIM, YADIM, ABIM, JIM, CIJ, SUARAM, PAS and PKR. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the data analysis were triangulated to ascertain the extent to which the information obtained was consistent or inconsistent across sources. The findings of the study showed that there were diverse views among respondents on what constitutes an Islamic press freedom in a multi-racial and multi-religious Malaysia. Due to the different levels of Islamic understanding and divergent interpretations of Islam among Muslims, especially among members of political parties, this study also found that the Islamic theory of press freedom is a highly contested concept. More often than not, the respondents of these organisations claimed that Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom should be based on their personal versions of Islam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom, Islamic perspective, tawhid, conservatism, liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualization, design, and scaling of drop generation in coflow processes</field><field name="creator">Manuela Duxenneuner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drop formation, coflow, monodispersity, scaling, dimensionless numbers, microfluidics, microPIV, hydroxypropyl-ether guar gum, Tween, sunflower oil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Material exchange in mangroves during tidal inundation</field><field name="creator">Maria Adame Vivanco</field><field name="description">Coastal wetlands dominated by mangroves provide important ecological services to the coastal zone, many of which are associated with tidal inundation . In this study I investigated whether all coastal wetlands provide similar ecosystem services, or whether these varied depending on their geomorphological setting and the eutrophication level of the floodwater. Sampling was conducted over two years with significantly different levels of rainfall over six estuaries in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Sediment, nutrient and carbon exchange were investigated in tidal and riverine estuaries dominated by mangrove forests. The estuaries selected also comprised a gradient from low mesotrophic to low eutrophic. Spatial variation within the coastal wetlands was also investigated, comparing nutrient exchange in the low and high intertidal cyanobacteria mat . To assess sediment exchange, I measured retention of total suspended solids and sedimentation rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment deposited in mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon (C) tracer, was used. Nutrient and C exchange were quantified by comparison of concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrogen oxides (NOx--N), ammonium (NH4+) total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in water entering and leaving the mangroves during complete tidal cycles (3 tidal cycles in 6 estuaries for 2 years). Finally, the biogeochemical function of the cyanobacteria mat was measured through experiments investigating nitrogen fixation (N) and nutrient exchange in the extensive mats in the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia. My results show that the seaward fringe mangrove retains the majority of sediment entering the wetland during a tidal cycle accounting for 52.5 &#177; 12.5 % of the total sedimentation (fringe mangrove + scrub mangrove + saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat). Geomorphological setting had a stronger influence on spatial patterns of deposition than on sedimentation rates. Riverine mangroves had more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the seaward fringe mangrove zone. The presence of glomalin in sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting. Glomalin was primarily delivered to riverine mangroves and deposited within the scrub mangrove zone, while tidal mangroves received less glomalin during tidal inundation and most of it was deposited within the fringe mangrove zone. Overall, NOx--N concentrations decreased in the floodwater after flooding the coastal wetland, suggesting that these ecosystems act as sinks of dissolved NOx--N during tidal inundation. In average, NOx--N concentrations in the floodwater decreased 28 %. Additionally, during periods of high rainfall the decrease in nutrient concentrations was more pronounced, and not only NOx--N but also SRP and NH4+ concentrations decreased to up to 51 % and 83 %, respectively. My results suggest that rainfall enhances nutrient removal by coastal wetlands in the region. Geomorphological setting also affected nutrient removal. Riverine mangroves received stronger nutrient pulses, which resulted in strongest rates of nutrient removal during tidal inundation. Nutrient removal was closely related to the nutrient concentration of the floodwater: high nutrient removal occurred when floodwater was rich in nutrients. The C entering the wetland in the floodwater was mainly composed of DOC and its exchange did not vary among sites with differing geomorphological setting. However, DOC exchange was strongly affected by the water quality of floodwater inundating the coastal wetland. DOC concentrations were higher in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH4+ and SRP, suggesting DOC import. Contrary, DOC concentrations were lower in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH4+ and SRP, suggesting DOC export. The high intertidal cyanobacteria mat was important in regulating N fluxes in coastal wetlands. In the arid Exmouth Gulf, where cyanobacteria mats are abundant, nitrogen fixation rates were 4.9 &#177; 3.2 nmol cm-1 h-1. Cyanobacteria mats also removed N from the floodwater in the form of NOx--N (0.47 &#177; 0.45 g m-2 h-1) and NH4+ (0.31 &#177; 0.02 g m-2 h-1). N fixation and nutrient removal from the floodwater was highly variable spatially and temporally. N fixation rates were highest during the day in the mat situated at low tidal elevations. Overall, I found that the material exchange in coastal wetlands is variable within the coastal zone as a result of natural factors, such as geomorphology, vegetation composition and rainfall. But material exchange in wetlands is also affected by anthropogenic factors, particularly eutrophication. From all these factors, eutrophication of the floodwater appears to be the most critical, shifting the mangrove function from a DOC source to a nutrient and DOC sink. Approximate thresholds of nutrient and C concentrations in the floodwater that are likely to trigger shifts in ecosystem function in coastal wetlands in Southeast Queensland, and thus in the ecosystem services they provide, are 0.02 mg L-1 of SRP, 0.04 mg L-1 of NH4+ and 7.5 mg L-1 of DOC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal wetlands, mangroves, tidal exchange, nutrients, carbon, nutrient pollution, eutrophication, ecosystem services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamical analysis of respiratory signals for diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing disorders.</field><field name="creator">Suren Rathnayake</field><field name="description">Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent but an under-diagnosed disease. Among adults in the ages between 30 to 60 years, 24% of males and 9% of females show conditions of SDB, while 82% of men and 93% of women with moderate to severe SDB remain undiagnosed. Polysomnography (PSG) is the reference diagnostic test for SDB. During PSG, a number of physiological signals are recorded during an overnight sleep and then manually scored for sleep/wake stages and SDB events to obtain the reference diagnosis. The manual scoring of SDB events is an extremely time consuming and cumbersome task with high inter- and intra-rater variations. PSG is a labour intensive, expensive and patient inconvenient test. Further, PSG facilities are limited leading to long waiting lists. There is an enormous clinical need for automation of PSG scoring and an alternative automated ambulatory method suitable for screening the population. During the work of this thesis, we focus (1) on implementing a framework that enables more reliable scoring of SDB events which also lowers manual scoring time, and (2) implementing a reliable automated screening procedure that can be used as a patient-friendly home based study. The recordings of physiological measurements obtained during patients&#8217; sleep of- ten suffer from data losses, interferences and artefacts. In a typical sleep scoring session, artifact-corrupted signal segments are visually detected and removed from further consideration. We developed a novel framework for automated artifact detection and signal restoration, based on the redundancy among respiratory flow signals. The signals focused on are the airflow (thermistor sensors) and nasal pressure signals that are clinically significant in detecting respira- tory disturbances. We treat the respiratory system as a dynamical system, and use the celebrated Takens embedding theorem as the theoretical basis for sig- nal prediction. In this study, we categorise commonly occurring artefacts and distortions in the airflow and nasal pressure measurements into several groups and explore the efficacy of the proposed technique in detecting/recovering them. Results we obtained from a database of clinical PSG signals indicated that theproposed technique can detect artefacts/distortions with a sensitivity &gt;88% and specificity &gt;92%. This work has the potential to simplify the work done by sleep scoring technicians, and also to improve automated sleep scoring methods. During the next phase of the thesis we have investigated the diagnostic ability of single &#8211; and dual&#8211;channel respiratory flow measuring devices. Recent studies have shown that single channel respiratory flow measurements can be used for automated diagnosis/screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) diseases. Improvements for reliable home-based monitoring for SDB may be achieved with the use of predictors based on recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA essentially measures the complex structures present in a time series and are relatively independent of the nonlinearities present in the respiratory measurements such as those due to breathing nonlinearities and sensor movements. The nasal pressure, thermistor-based airflow, abdominal movement and thoracic movement measurements obtained during Polysomnography, were used in this study to implement an algorithm for automated screening for SDB diseases. The algorithm predicts SDB-affected measurement segments using twelve features based on RQA, body mass index (BMI) and neck circumference using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). The rate of SDB affected segments of data per hour of recording (RDIS) is used as a measure for the diagnosis of SDB diseases. The operating points to be chosen were the prior probability of SDB affected data segments (&#960;1) and the RDIS threshold value, above which a patient is predicted to have a SDB disease. Cross-validation with five-folds, stratified based on the RDI values of the recordings, was used in estimating the operating points. Sensitivity and specificity rates for the final classifier were estimated using a two-layer assessment approach with the operating points chosen at the inner layer using five-fold cross-validation and the choice assessed at the outer layer using repeated learning-testing. The nasal pressure measurement showed higher accuracy compared to other respiratory measurements when used alone. The nasal pressure and thoracic movement measurements were identified as the best pair of measurements to be used in a dual channel device. The estimated sensitivity and specificity (standard error) in diagnosing SDB disease (RDI &#8805; 15) are 90.3(3.1)% and 88.3(5.5)% when nasal pressure is used alone and together with the thoracic movement it was 89.5(3.7)% and 100.0(0.0)%. Present results suggest that RQA of a single respiratory measurement has potential to be used in an automated SDB screening device, while with dual-channel more reliable accuracy can be expected. Improvements may be possible by including other RQA based features and optimisation of the parameters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear signal analysis</field><field name="subject">dynamic systems modelling</field><field name="subject">sleep disordered breathing</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">recurrence quantification analysis</field><field name="subject">mixture discriminant analysis</field><field name="subject">cross-validation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'&#8216;Because You Demanded It!': Participatory Culture and Superhero Comic Books</field><field name="creator">Taina Lloyd</field><field name="description">Comic books are one of the many popular cultural forms that attract, as part of their audience, a committed readership that engages in a participatory relationship as part of a shared interest in the text. In common with other media forms, this engagement expresses itself in a variety of ways, including interaction with other readers online and face-to-face at conventions, correspondence with producers, and the creation of textual products. Other features of the discourses and practices of this community may be more specific to the comic book readership. One of the most interesting of these is a participatory belief, widely expressed by readers, that they can influence the story content of the published comic book and that comic books are unique among other media forms in this. In this thesis, I investigate several aspects of this belief, in order to offer a more nuanced understanding of the participatory involvement that readers have in comic books, particularly the superhero comic books that dominate American comic book culture. First, I examine whether this participatory belief is supported by evidence from published comic books by undertaking a content analysis of the letter columns and story pages of comic books. Next, I explore the discourses of online comic book culture that relate to authorship and the boundaries of participation and show how the rules of textual engagement that are held by readers shape the interactions between readers and producers. Finally, I look for alternative participatory spaces that are available to comic book readers, finding these in a contested form of engagement with comic books, that of exploring the fictional universes of the text. This approach imagines the text as the representation of a non-actual world, to which the comic book is an incomplete window. Theorising this mode of engagement leads to a conceptualisation of participation that makes visible a participatory space that has been previously overlooked by academic fan studies, and that complicates the existing models of participatory culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">fan culture</field><field name="subject">cultural studies</field><field name="subject">comic books</field><field name="subject">fictional worlds</field><field name="subject">participation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intellectual Liberty: Intellectual Property</field><field name="creator">Hugh Breakey</field><field name="description">Natural rights theories have powerful reasons to limit the strength, scope and duration of intellectual property rights. These reasons come in two forms &#8211; limitations internal to the basic functioning of natural rights as such and limitations arising from rights-based considerations external to the property right. In terms of internal constraints, all natural rights conform to a variety of conditions delimiting the extent and strength of their application. Such conditions include, inter alia, requirements for consistency, universalisability and non-worsening. Like all rights, natural property rights must fulfil these conditions &#8211; but such rights require substantial limitations in order to legitimate their capacity to unilaterally impose new duties on others. Consideration of these conditions is, I argue, not sufficient to rule out natural intellectual property rights &#8211; but such conditions decisively limit the extent of those rights. By focusing upon the most general and deep-seated mechanisms of natural rights thought, this argument aims to be applicable to all natural rights theories. I argue natural rights theories have good reasons to accept one, if not both, of two conditions in particular: robust universalisability and self-ownership. As strong intellectual property rights violate both conditions, I conclude such rights cannot be justified by any recognisable natural rights theory. Turning to external considerations, I argue all individuals have a right to intellectual liberty &#8211; the right to inform their actions by learning about the world. This is a negative right: it grants freedom from interference in apprehending, investigating and thinking about the world, and in subsequently acting upon what has been learned. I argue this right is grounded in all Enlightenment views of human freedom and flourishing; it is supported by classical liberal State of Nature perspectives, and arises out of respect for human independence, self-governance, self-legislation, self-creation, autonomy and individuality. Acceptance of this right has profound consequences for the strength and scope of intellectual property regimes. I describe the extent we can find this right already operative &#8211; albeit in schematic and inchoate form &#8211; in contemporary intellectual property law.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural rights</field><field name="subject">intellectual property</field><field name="subject">copyright</field><field name="subject">legal rights</field><field name="subject">John Locke</field><field name="subject">public domain</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do Better Institutions Alleviate the Resource Curse? Evidence from a Dynamic Panel Approach.</field><field name="creator">Malebogo Bakwena</field><field name="description">Contrary to conventional theory, a growing body of evidence suggests that economies with abundant natural resources perform badly in terms of economic growth relative to their resource poor counterparts&#8212;the so-called resource curse hypothesis. However, this general hypothesis is not robust. It clearly fails to account for the differing experiences of resource abundant economies. For instance, the theory, applied generally, offers no explanation as to why economies like Botswana and Norway have exceptional growth while Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have stagnated. Prompted by these experiences, the thesis investigates the circumstances under which the curse is more or less likely to exist. In particular, the thesis finds evidence that the major reason for the diverging experiences is the differences in the quality of institutions across countries. The thesis tests the hypothesis that the effect of resources on growth is conditional on the type and quality of institutions, by further building on Boschini, Pettersson, and Roine&#8217;s (2007) and Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik&#8217;s (2006b) influential works on the role of institutions in mitigating the resource curse. Advances are made by: (a) using a panel of up to 53 countries with different levels of development, institutional quality and natural resource abundance over the period 1984-2003; (b) applying a two-step system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation that accounts for biases associated with omitted variables, endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity that potentially affect existing cross-country Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) growth results; (c) supplementing results of the commonly used International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) institutional performance indicators with those of institutional design indicators&#8211;that is, highlighting the role of electoral rules and form of government; (d) using an institutional quality measure that is more related to financial institutions than just economic or political institutions; (e) using a resource abundance indicator that focuses on non-renewable resources alone rather than the ones commonly used in the literature that include renewable resources, which are inappropriate. The key hypothesis that natural resource economies are not destined to be cursed if they have good institutions is confirmed by the empirical results of the thesis. Specifically, the results suggest that (a) adopting a democratic regime is better than a non-democratic one, in terms of generating growth from resource abundance (b) the electoral rules that a country adopts matter, i.e. having a democratic proportional rather than a democratic majority regime increases the growth benefits of resource abundance (c) as far as the form of government adopted is concerned, a democratic parliamentary rather than a democratic presidential regime generates more economic growth from its abundant natural resource (d) a well functioning banking sector induces more (resource abundant generated) growth and capital accumulation. Therefore, the lessons for policy makers who struggle to overcome the impediments to economic development that potentially accompany the &#8220;curse of resource abundance&#8221; are the need to develop and maintain better institutions and adopt improved management strategies of the financial proceeds forthcoming from such abundance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">(institutional quality, resource curse, dynamic panel, generalised method of moments)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Needs-based and needs-focused care: Understanding the needs of children and young people in care in Australia through the documentary analysis of multiple stakeholder perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stewart Redshaw</field><field name="description">Over the last decade out-of-home care in Australia has experienced a period of considerable turmoil as royal commissions, parliamentary inquiries, departmental audits, empirical research and industry reports have highlighted the dire straits of the care system. A constant theme throughout has been the failure of the sector to adequately meet the needs of children and young people in care. Within this context the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of children and young people in care in Australia, giving voice to the full range of stakeholders, whose views were expressed in multiple documentary types. Specifically, the aim was to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs and formulate this into a formal taxonomy of needs. Using document analysis and the constant comparative method within the constructivist paradigm of social inquiry, the study involved analysis of 580 non-traditional, naturalistic and secondary documents relating to out-of-home care in Australia. The document sample consisted of five data types: primary data (letters, submissions to inquiries, transcripts of interviews and public hearings, and personal accounts); secondary data (reports resulting from commissions of inquiries and departmental reviews, audits and investigations); empirical data (the published findings from empirical research); legislative and policy data (legislation, regulation and quality frameworks); and industry and practitioner data (reports by academics, peak bodies and advocacy groups, and writings by out-of-home care practitioners). Further, the document sample included stakeholders from five major groups: children and young people in care (and former wards ); their parents and extended family; carers, agency staff and practitioners; statutory workers; and academics, advocates, and representatives of state and national peak bodies. The findings include a series of prominent themes of care; salient findings that highlight the experiences and needs of children and young people in care; and the taxonomy of needs. The prominent themes include the importance of natural family connectedness, cultural identity and connectedness, and counselling and therapeutic support. Issues relating to placement stability and disruption, safety and protection and, transition from care also featured prominently. The salient findings include an exploration of the overwhelming emotions of care, emotional putdowns, vicarious trauma and the witnessing of violence and abuse in out-of-home care, characteristics of children and young people who survive and thrive in care and beyond, characteristics of quality carers, symptom intolerance, disenfranchised grief &#8211; the never-ending story, and the defensive behaviours of children and young people in care. The taxonomy of needs provides a comprehensive overview of the needs of children and young people in care across 89 attributes and 21 attribute sub-categories, within 21 dimensions, and across three domains (the personal, placement, and community-of-care domains). The dimensions in the personal domain include attachment, physical development and health, personal growth, education and vocational attainment, development of the inner-self, and hope in life and for the future. The placement domain includes basic needs, basic entitlements, caring relationships, positive-parenting-practices, activity programming, focused-support, peer-relations and positive group management, and preparation for and transition from care. The community-of-care domain includes clinical intervention, family connectedness and involvement in placement, friends and social outlets, significant others, cultural-religious-spiritual connectedness, departmental worker capacity and support, and after care support. The principal theoretical, practice, and methodological conclusions derived from this study are that children and young people in care in Australia have considerable needs, are largely unable to meet their own needs, and experience harm when their needs are not met. Consequently, the out-of-home care sector has an inescapable obligation to provide for these needs if children and young people in care are to avoid harm and experience personal wellbeing. Further, children and young people in care have experienced considerable need deprivation, and if their needs are not to be forgotten, then a shift to a &#8216;needs-based&#8217;, &#8216;needs-focused&#8217; paradigm of care is needed to inform out-of-home care policy, service design, and day-to-day practice. And finally, document analysis using non-traditional, naturalistic, and secondary data (representing the full range of stakeholder perspectives) within a constructivist paradigm of inquiry, provides an effective, indeed powerful methodology for exploring the needs of children and young people in care, and for giving voice to the many stakeholders who voices may never have been heard again.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Needs</field><field name="subject">Out-of-home care</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Quality care</field><field name="subject">Document analysis</field><field name="subject">Constant comparative method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between hypothalamic gene expression and the resumption of ovulation in postpartum beef cows</field><field name="creator">Ainu Husna M S Suhaimi</field><field name="description">The aim in this thesis was to gain an understanding of changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus of postpartum beef cows during the period of transition from suppressed ovarian follicular growth to increased follicular growth, and the resumption of ovulation. Beef cows tend to have an extended period of anoestrus after calving. This trait is particularly pronounced in tropically-adapted Zebu breeds. In addition to a genetic component, the postpartum anoestrous period can be influenced by age, body condition, the nutrient requirement of lactation, suckling stimulus, and maternal bonding. An extended postpartum anoestrous period is particularly evident in primiparous beef cows. This is understandable given that primiparous cows have yet to reach their mature body size which means there is a requirement to maintain maternal tissue growth whilst at the same time directing nutrients for milk production. Weaning removes maternal bonding, the suckling stimulus and nutrient requirement of milk production and, provided that nutrient supply and body condition are appropriate, primiparous cows show increased ovarian activity and resume ovulation after weaning. In the present thesis, groups of primiparous Zebu cows were weaned to promote increased ovarian follicular growth and hypothalamic gene expression was compared for weaned cows and contemporary cows that continued to lactate. Candidate genes were studied using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and a gene expression microarray was used to discover new genes and gene networks. Gene expression was examined in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area (sub-region H1) and posterior ventral hypothalamus (sub-region H2). The demarcation between H1 and H2 was a vertical line from the mid-point of the median eminence-pituitary stalk to the thalamus. Candidate genes studied by qRT-PCR included, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GNRH1), kisspeptin (KISS1), neuropeptide Y (NPY), oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and leptin receptor (LEPR). Marked regional expression was demonstrated for these genes. The expression of GNRH1 was greatest in the anterior hypothalamic region (sub-region H1) whilst the expression of KISS1 was greatest in the ventral posterior hypothalamic region (sub-region H2). Relative expression of LEPR, ESR1 and NPY was greater in H2 than H1. The regional gene expression patterns for GNRH1, KISS1, LEPR, ESR1 and NPY in the hypothalamus of cows were consistent with regional expression reported for other species. Weaning was associated with a decrease in the expression of LEPR, ESR1 and NPY. With regard to ovarian phenotype, there was a greater LEPR expression associated with ovarian phenotype 1 (OP1, follicles to 5mm) compared with ovarian phenotype 2 (OP2, follicles to 10mm) and ovarian phenotype 3 (OP3, recently ovulated) in sub-region H1. Relative expressions for ESR1, LEPR and NPY were highly correlated, particularly in sub-region H2. The evaluation of gene expression by microarray for cows with different ovarian phenotypes provided evidence of interactions between hormonal regulation and cell-cell signalling within the hypothalamus. Genes that were differentially expressed for different ovarian phenotypes were associated with reproduction, energy balance, the immune system and stress. Other genes that showed differential expression were involved with cell adhesion, synaptic transmission, ion signalling and neuronal development. The latter findings were interpreted to suggest that neuronal and glial cell plasticity is a feature of changes in reproductive functions of the hypothalamus. The evaluation of gene expression by microarray for weaned and suckled cows, irrespective of ovarian phenotype, identified differentially expressed genes associated with energy balance, fluid homeostasis, milk synthesis, stress, and oestrogen signalling. With regard the latter, thirty seven genes involved in oestrogen signalling through ESR1, or in other ways associated with oestrogen, were found to be differentially expressed between weaned and lactating cows. ESR1 occupied the central position of a primary gene network based on the present study. Six differentially expressed genes were shown by gene network analysis to be centred in nodes interacting closely with ESR1. Phospholipase-C-gamma (PLCG2), vitronectin (VTN) and endopin 1 (SERPINA3) are three genes associated with hypothalamic plasticity and neurotransmission that were differentially expressed between cows with OP1 and OP2, indicating a possible role in the shift to increased ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. The findings for ESR1 were consistent with the major role of oestrogen in female reproduction and in particular the known actions of oestrogen in regulating the hypothalamus during reproductive transition phases in females associated with puberty, seasonality and postpartum. Gonadotrophin inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is derived from Neuropeptide VF precursor (NPVF), which is encoded by NPVF gene transcripts. NPVF had reduced expression in cows that had ovulated (OP3) compared with OP1 and OP2. GnIH inhibits gonadotrophin secretion by directly acting on GnRH neurons as well as modulating the suppressive effects of oestrogen negative feedback. In addition, GnIH has been shown to play a role in seasonal regulation of reproduction in birds. The lesser expression of NPVF in cows that had resumed ovulation, particularly evident in sub-region H2, provides initial evidence that GnIH has an important role in maintaining the suppressive effects on reproduction during postpartum anoestrus in cattle. In summary, the studies in this thesis have identified hypothalamic genes and gene networks that potentially are important in the control of reproductive function in the postpartum cow. The thesis has also established that the postpartum cow can be used as an experimental model for fundamental studies that generate new knowledge on the reproductive biology of the postpartum period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postpartum anoestrus</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">hypothalamus</field><field name="subject">quantitative RT-PCR</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legitimation of violence against women in Colombia: A feminist critical discourse analytic study</field><field name="creator">Laura Tolton</field><field name="description">This study analyses the legitimation of violence against women in Colombia, using critical discourse analysis to explore attitudes related to violence, gender, and power. Internet forums from the website of the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo provide everyday examples of talk about two incidents of violence against women (VAW), a sexual assault and a wife-beating, both of which triggered a large scale reaction from the Colombian public. Colombia is a unique context to study the normalisation of VAW. This nation has been characterised by high levels of violence over the last sixty years, suffering through evolving stages of armed conflict. Militarisation has been shown to increase the occurrence of VAW (Kelly, 2000), and the normalisation of VAW may intensify as well in militarily violent contexts (Hume, 2004; McWilliams, 1998). Critical discourse analysis offers theory and methodology to examine an aspect of life in terms of social justice and power (Fairclough, 2003; Resende, 2009), denaturalising the discursive practices which help to produce and reproduce power relations between social groups (Fairclough &amp; Wodak, 1997; van Dijk, 1993). This study examines legitimation, a social action realised in discourse, which has the goal of setting and reinforcing a certain social order. The project also explores how legitimation in these forums is tied to Colombian culture and the topic of VAW. Drawing on the methods of van Dijk (1988, 1998, 2001) ,Wood and Kroger (2000), and grounded theory (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008), multiple readings of the forums elicited salient themes as well as discursive strategies used to carry out legitimation of VAW. These were analysed in terms of underlying social beliefs prevailing in Colombian society. Dominant themes emerging from analysis of the sexual assault forums include: &#8216;&#8220;real&#8221; violence is more important&#8217;; &#8216;this incident was not a big deal&#8217;; &#8216;it&#8217;s her fault anyway&#8217;; and &#8216;she should have appreciated it&#8217;. These manifest the dominant strategies and structures of contrasts, minimisation, victim blaming, and romanticisation/sexualisation, respectively. Analysis of the wife-beating forums reveals the following themes: &#8216;this is not related to me&#8217;; &#8216;wife-beating is a private issue&#8217;; &#8216;domestic violence is normal and even important&#8217;; &#8216;it is the victim&#8217;s responsibility to change&#8217;; and &#8216;the victim deserves this violence&#8217;. Dominant strategies included respectively: distancing explanations and solutions, discourses of privacy, normalising violence, focusing on the victim, and victim blaming. The forum analyses illustrate how legitimation relates to Colombian culture and the topic of VAW. Numerous elements of culture and topic are used to criticise women&#8217;s agency and suggest that women ought to be passive and silent. In one culture-related example, the Colombian reiteration of violent events works to silence women&#8217;s stories about their experiences of VAW. Another strong element of culture is found in Colombian sayings and proverbs presenting a common knowledge discourse normalising VAW as romantic, sexual and necessary. Discourses used more universally to justify VAW include the idea that women belong in the private sphere and the psychopathologisation of women as attention-seeking and slutty. These elements work together to suggest that women are strong, sexual, and dangerous, needing violence from an authority to keep them uncomplaining and submissive. This work can inform future studies about discourse concerning VAW in Hispanic contexts, sketching in a little-studied disciplinary intersection. As this research participates in the aims of feminist critical discourse analysis, it is hoped that the present study will also be used for critical campaigns aimed at media specialists and educators so that they may create greater awareness and promote change, pointing out and discouraging these discourses legitimating violence against women in Colombia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist critical discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">violence against women</field><field name="subject">wife abuse</field><field name="subject">sexual assault</field><field name="subject">legitimation</field><field name="subject">Spanish linguistics</field><field name="subject">Colombian culture</field><field name="subject">macropropositions</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">online newspaper forums</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems science analysis of the context/s of child protection reform in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Joel Cullin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Child protection, reform, systems science, complexity, cybernetics, system theory, organisational reform, Queensland child protection system, Department of Child Safety.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charged Liposaccharide Based Drug Delivery Systems</field><field name="creator">Adel Abdel Rahim</field><field name="description">Abstract Many hydrophilic drugs do not easily cross biological membranes. One approach to improve intestinal absorption of hydrophilic compounds is to co-administer these drug molecules with absorption enhancers to optimize their physico-chemical properties. In this project, novel liposaccharides were used to modulate the aqueous solubility as well as increase the lipophilicity, improve the intestinal permeability and hence, oral bioavailability of hydrophilic molecules. However, the solubility of the drug/liposaccharide mixtures in aqueous system might be poor, therefore, introducing a hydrophilic component such as quaternization of amine derivatives or sodium salt of carboxylic acid is required to modulate hydrophilic/lipophilic balance and in the same time and promote surfactant and ion pairing characteristics of these derivatives. This dissertation illustrates the development of novel liposaccharide absorption enhancers to be used for oral delivery of hydrophilic drugs. This research includes chemical synthesis of new ionic liposaccharides, examination of their physico-chemical properties, and their in vitro and in vivo biological examinations. The work consists of two parts; cationic and anionic liposaccharide absorption enhancers. a) Cationic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers The focus of this work was on the molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel cationic liposaccharide derivatives as drug delivery agents to improve the oral bioavailability of piperacillin as a model hydrophilic drug. These derivatives were designed to possess surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible and biodegradable materials such as glucose, lipoamino acids and lipophilic amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of piperacillin/liposaccharide conjugates were studied to investigate the effect of liposaccharides on piperacillin activity. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers for the oral delivery of piperacillin was assessed in vitro (Caco-2 cells) and in vivo (rat oral absorption). It was concluded that these derivatives did show hemolytic activity in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity), while they increased permeability of piperacillin through Caco-2 cells. However, these promising results obtained from in vitro assay were not confirmed in vivo. viii b) Anionic Liposaccharide Absorption Enhancers In this thesis, molecular design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel anionic liposaccharide derivatives as absorption enhancers to improve the intestinal permeability of a model hydrophilic drug such as tobramycin were carried out. These derivatives were designed to have surfactant as well as ion pairing properties, and were synthesized from biocompatible materials such as sugar, lipoamino acids and amino acids. Thermodynamic profiles of these derivatives as well as haemolytic activity were examined. Many absorption enhancers have (to some extent) cytotoxic activity, therefore, cytotoxic activity of the novel anionic liposaccharides were examined. The usefulness of these derivatives as absorption enhancers to increase the lipophilicity of tobramycin and hence, its oral bioavailability, was evaluated through carrying out partition coefficient examination. It was concluded that these derivatives did not show haemolytic and cytotoxic activities in low concentration (suitable for enhancing activity). In addition, the permeability of tobramycin into the organic phase (n-octanol) was increased when liposaccharide derivatives were used. The obtained results are promising and encouraging to continue the work to include Caco-2 cells assay (in vitro assay) and oral absorption in rats (in vivo assay) as a prospective work in the future.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sugar, lipoamino acids, amino acids cationic liposaccharides, anionic liposaccharides.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PROFILES AND INSTRUCTIONAL INTERVENTIONS OF READING COMPREHENSION: A Study of Upper Primary School Students in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Sri Tiatri</field><field name="description">International studies have shown the reading competence of Indonesian students to be relatively low compared to other countries. Considering the importance of reading comprehension, the current research has two aims. The first is to provide some insight into the identification of students&#8217; difficulty with reading. The second is to investigate the implementation of innovative methods for teaching reading comprehension in the Indonesian educational context. Both studies were conducted in state upper grade primary schools in Urban Sub District BCL in Bandung, Indonesia. Study One profiled students&#8217; reading performance. Five measurement instruments were developed, written in Indonesian language. The construction of mental models was also introduced. Two hundred and sixty five Grade Five students from eight schools were measured for their competence in decoding, prior knowledge, comprehension monitoring, construction of mental models, reading comprehension specifically related to a particular topic, and their general reading comprehension. The students&#8217; reading performance profiles were very varied. They showed the importance of each component for the achievement of reading comprehension. The profiles also showed the ability for each component of reading comprehension to compensate each other&#8217;s function to enable the students to perform well in reading comprehension. The best-fit model for the data accounted for 47% of students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. Study Two compared instructional interventions, and examined the way each method worked in the Indonesian educational context. The three instructional intervention methods were Reciprocal Teaching (RT), Instruction prompting students to develop Mental Models (IMM), and Instruction in Question Answering (IQA). Participants were one hundred and twelve students in the Sixth Grade from three primary schools. There were three groups in each school. Group 1 received RT followed by IMM (RT-IMM), Group 2 received IMM followed by RT (IMM-RT), and Group 3 received IQA. Group 3 was considered as the control group, since IQA is the traditional method widely adopted in Indonesia. Instruction was separated into 2 phases. Each phase consisted of four sessions of 30 minutes each over a two-week period. The implementation of IMM-RT tended to improve general reading comprehension more than other methods (RT-IMM and IQA). Interestingly, individuals who had a low performance in the pre-test for construction of mental models, improved their performance in the construction of mental models following implementation of RT at the first phase. The results support a conclusion that the IMM-RT combination is potentially effective for the enhancement of students&#8217; reading comprehension. However, further results showed that, in order to implement RT and IMM in a common state school classroom in Indonesia, the teacher&#8217;s ability to manage and organise the group becomes crucial. Study Three was designed to validate the IMM-RT instructional intervention for improving performances of students with reading comprehension inadequacies, by addressing the limitations found in Study Two. Result showed that IMM-RT had potential for improving students&#8217; performance in reading comprehension. The findings of the current study provide some understanding of reading comprehension in an Indonesian educational context. Moreover, the findings will add to the repertoire of educators about issues that need to be considered in implementing innovative methods for enhancing Indonesian students&#8217; reading comprehension.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reading comprehension</field><field name="subject">decoding</field><field name="subject">prior knowledge</field><field name="subject">comprehension monitoring</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">intervention</field><field name="subject">reciprocal teaching</field><field name="subject">question answering</field><field name="subject">Indonesian context</field><field name="subject">teacher</field><field name="subject">students</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Inequality Measurement</field><field name="creator">Nicholas Rohde</field><field name="description">The thesis presents results from five related studies concerned with the development and application of analytical techniques for the measurement of inequality. Four of the research pieces are analytical works focusing on the methodology of inequality measurement, while the fifth is an empirical study of income mobility and inequality in Australia. The most significant work of the dissertation is concerned with the derivation of a new information-theoretic index for the measurement of inequality. The proposed index is based upon the same relationship between information theory and inequality measurement used for the construction of Generalized Entropy (GE) inequality measures and is equivalent to a technique established in the field of signal processing. The measure shares the axiomatic superiority of GE measures over other measurement techniques and exhibits an additional attractive decomposition property such that the contribution of any set of individuals towards inequality is directly observable. No existing axiomatically complete measure possesses this property and thus the new measure has a degree of dominance over other techniques such as the Gini coefficient and Theil&#8217;s entropy measures. An empirical illustration of the new index using U.S. unit record income data is provided to demonstrate the alternative decomposition technique. It is shown that persons self-described as &#8216;White&#8217; or &#8216;Japanese&#8217; in the U.S. census drive a greater proportion of total inequality than persons from other racial groups relative to their respective population sizes. Other theoretical work in the thesis focuses on the construction and interpretation of Lorenz curves. A new parametric functional form for estimating the Lorenz curve is presented and closed form expressions for the implicit probability density function, cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient are derived. Furthermore the proposed Lorenz curve is shown to provide a better fit to a range of real world data than other single parameter specifications such as the Pareto formulation. In a separate chapter the issue of Lorenz curve determination is addressed by determining a convex spline to interpolate Lorenz curves from grouped data. The spline is shown to provide better estimates of the Gini coefficient than other interpolation techniques and always satisfies the regularity conditions required for a Lorenz curve. Additional work on Lorenz curves examines the link between these functions and GE inequality metrics. In the thesis it is shown that these indices may be derived as direct functions of the Lorenz curve and analytical expressions for various GE measures are given in terms of Lorenz curve parameters. These results provide a basis for studying the effect of Lorenz curve construction upon the calculation of entropy based inequality measurements. The thesis concludes with an empirical study into income inequality and mobility in Australia using the HILDA unit record and household data panel. The research shows that Australian income mobility is slightly lower than in other developed countries and that much of the observed mobility occurs at the lower end of the income distribution.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Generalized Entropy, Income mobility, Inequality, Lorenz curve</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management in Malaysian five star hotels: Human resource practices system differentiation and its outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rozila Ahmad</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis explores the management of human resources (HR) in five star hotels located in a developing country (Malaysia). This study is particularly relevant to the hotel industry, known for its traditionally poor HR practices (e.g., a lack of employment security, training, and career development opportunity, low levels of employee involvement and an increasing number of casual employees who are paid hourly). These practices are often perceived as a solution to high labour costs and fluctuating demand prevalent in the hotel industry. However, it is often only "non-managerial" employees who are affected by poor HR practices, as more sophisticated approaches to HR practices are often taken with regard to managerial (strategic) level employees. HR practices system differentiation (HRPSD), or HR architecture, involves having more than one HR practices system within an organisation. HRPSD has been criticised in the hospitality management literature for the poor HR practices in the management of non-managerial employees, however despite this criticism, it is widely practiced by the industry. The continuation of HRPSD practices in the hotel industry suggests its importance to better understand, research and study. The aim of this research is to gain an understanding of HRPSD in a hotel industry context, and to better understand the immediate effects of such practices. While the existing literature concerning HR architecture in other industries provides some discussion of HRPSD, research and study of the concept focusing on the hotel industry is essential in providing a detailed explanation of the effect of this phenomenon, as HR practices between industries may vary. Central to this study, is an investigation of the nature of HRPSD, identification of HR intermediate outcomes, and the effects of HRPSD on hotel employees. Studying the effect of HRPSD on employees is important because employees are known to be a hotel organisations&#8223; most important resource. Developed based on the literature of SHRM and HR architecture, this study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates HRPSD in the SHRM model originally proposed by Schuler, Dowling, Smart, and Huber (1992). Guided by this model, this study seeks to answer the critical questions of &#8220;how organisations differentiate their HR practices systems&#8221; and &#8220;what are the corresponding HR intermediate outcomes?&#8221; A particular foci of this thesis relates to how the concept of a &#8220;strategic&#8221; (or managerial) job is conceptualised in the hotel industry, what the elements of HR practices systems in five-star hotels are, how and why hotel organisations differentiate their HR practices systems, what the HR intermediate outcomes of HRPSD are and how HRPSD relates to the identified HR intermediate outcomes. To answer these complex research issues, a multiple case research methodology is employed, utilising a series of in depth semi-structured interviews. This vi study focuses specifically on five-star hotels in Malaysia because HR practices vary among hotels of various sizes. The findings indicate a notable effect of HRPSD on employees&#8223; motivation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and retention, and that excessive differentiation is not beneficial for a five star hotel. In this study only certain HR practices were found to be differentiated; selective staffing, extensive training, compensation and empowerment. HR practices that were applied to all employees without differentiation were a clear job description, orientation, employment security, objective performance appraisal, career development opportunity and effective communication. In addition, this study also provides a clear definition of the strategic job in the hotel industry, and demonstrates the importance of HR practices integration and the influence of internal and external environments on the formation of HR strategy. This research contributes to theory as well as hotel sector policy and practice. Theoretically, it has identified how HRPSD links to firm performance (in Malaysian five star hotels). In addition, it provides clear definitions and understanding of the strategic job concept as well as identification of HR practices system elements and their differentiation in five-star hotels. Furthermore, the theoretical framework developed can be useful for future quantitative studies which can test the model formulated in this study. For practitioners, the detailed examination of HR practices system elements and how they are differentiated may guide them in their future HR strategy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel, strategy, human resource management, practices system, differentiation, intermediate outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facts, Fiction, Romance and Propaganda &#8211; The Complex Nature of the Sources for Alexander&#8217;s Subjugation of India</field><field name="creator">Michael Welch</field><field name="description">Abstract This dissertation demonstrates that the ancient source traditions which furnish historians with information concerning Alexander the Great&#8217;s subjugation of India are deeply complex and often underappreciated as being such. This is done through a systematic analysis of the various extant and fragmentary traditions surrounding this period. Therefore, the evidence of the authors who wrote about Alexander&#8217;s Indian campaign directly after, or within a generation or so of it, are first discussed. This involves primarily a study of the extant fragments of many of the men who accompanied Alexander himself. This is followed by an investigation into the so-called &#8216;secondary authors&#8217;, or our extant histories of Alexander. The focus here is on evaluating the transmission of detail, bias, and distortion through the various aims, methods and prejudices of these later historians. Following this, there is a discussion of the numismatic evidence relating to the Indian campaign. This involves a study of Alexander&#8217;s &#8216;elephant medallions&#8217; and various coins of the Diadochoi in which the intricacies of our documentary evidence is made evident. Finally, there is included in this dissertation a case study in which the problematic nature of the ancient evidence surrounding this period of the great conqueror&#8217;s life is shown.

HSCT reconstitutes the immune and haematopoietic systems after myeloablative conditioning and inhibits the recurrence of the malignancy by a graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) response mediated by donor T cells. However, significant post-transplant complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) continue to plague the event-free survival of this curative procedure. GVHD is facilitated by donor T cells that recognise histocompatibility antigens on host antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC). Current treatment options for GVHD are focused on these T cells. However, these treatments result in an increased incidence of infection, graft rejection and relapse. A novel means of immunosuppression in GVHD is the use of multi-potent, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). MSC are non-immunogenic cells that actively suppress T cell function in vitro, and can resolve steroid-refractory GVHD in the clinic. Despite their use in the clinic, there is a paucity of pre-clinical data. Our aim was to investigate the in vivo efficacy of MSC to control GVHD while maintaining the beneficial GVL effect, and to begin to understand the mechanism by which MSC exert their immunosuppressive effects. We isolated and characterised MSC from murine bone/bone marrow and demonstrated that they suppressed T cell proliferation in vitro, even at low ratios of 1 MSC per 100 T cells. This was true of both donor-derived MSC, and MSC derived from unrelated donors (third party). Importantly, we observed that MSC significantly reduced T cell production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; in culture supernatants and that IFN&#947; plays a key role in the ability of MSC to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, we examined the effects of donor-derived MSC on GVHD severity and onset in two myeloablative murine models of HSCT. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used as a proof&#8211;of-principle model [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB/c (H-2d)], and an MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used to mimic MHC-matched sibling transplantation [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB.B (H-2b)]. We examined a number of variables related to MSC infusion including timing, dose and route of injection. We found that early post transplant infusion of MSC by the intraperitoneal injection was most effective at delaying death from GVHD, compared to pre-transplant infusion or intravenous injection. Furthermore, we found that the dose of MSC was critical, as infusion of too few MSC was ineffective and infusion of too many MSC exacerbated the development of GVHD. Taken together, these results suggest that timing, dose and route of injection are all important factors to be considered to ensure successful therapeutic outcome. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of action, we conducted timed sacrifice experiments in the MHC-mismatched model to determine if MSC altered cytokine secretion and cellular effectors, such as DC, known to play a key role in GVHD. Despite the fact that MSC given post-HSCT enter an environment full of activated DC and IFN&#947; levels, by day 3 and 6 post infusion, these activated DC and IFN&#947; levels are decreased compared to controls or mice infused with MSC pre-transplant (p&lt;0.05). This confirmed our in vitro data that IFN&#947; played an important role in MSC-mediated immunosuppression. In addition, when we removed a major source of IFN&#947; production in vivo by administering the T cell depleting antibody KT3 to mice with or without MSC, we found that although T cell depletion prolonged survival, MSC were unable to further enhance this effect. This was also true when MSC were used in combination with the conventional immunosuppressant cyclosporine. Finally, we examined whether the infusion of MSC would compromise the GVL effect. We found that whilst MSC could delay the onset of GVHD, in our model they did not alter the anti-tumour effects of the donor T cells. Overall, we have shown that MSC can delay but not prevent death from GVHD when administered at an appropriate time and dose and that IFN&#947; is required for MSC-mediated immunosuppression in our model. These data suggest that patients undergoing HSCT should be monitored for IFN&#947;, and administered MSC when high levels are reached. Whilst MSC may be a promising therapy for patients with severe GVHD, we highlight that further investigation is warranted before MSC are accepted for widespread use in the clinic. The risks and benefits for transplant recipients should be carefully considered before utilising MSC to treat or prevent GVHD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</field><field name="subject">Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)</field><field name="subject">Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)</field><field name="subject">Interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clathrin Independent Carriers: Molecular characterisation of a novel clathrin-independent endocytic pathway</field><field name="creator">Mark Howes</field><field name="description">Endocytosis effectuates a critical interface between the eukaryotic cell and its apposing environment. It is, subsequently, paramount for many physiologically important processes and encompasses a diverse array of mechanisms and pathways. The classical endocytic routes mediated by clathrin and caveolin are the best understood and the molecular roles of their major regulators, such as dynamin, adaptor proteins and various lipid species, are the most comprehensively described. Recent identification of an assortment of constitutive, noncaveolar, clathrin-independent endocytic (CIE) pathways has expanded the endocytic system. Unlike the classical endocytic pathways, little is known about the guiding parameters of CIE routes. Consequently, it is not possible to understand the important cellular roles these pathways may be fulfilling. This study has begun to characterise the very basic parameters governing the morphologically striking Clathrin-Independent Carrier (CLIC) pathway. Development of a diverse molecular toolkit has now allowed the quantitation of endocytic capacity provided by CLICs, the visualisation of subtle sorting components of the CLIC pathway, the isolation of novel CLIC cargo and regulators, and has linked this mechanism to the critical cellular processes of cellular migration and membrane repair. Calculation of the individual capacity of endocytic routes provides important information about the contribution of each pathway to total plasma membrane (PM) uptake and turnover. Quantitation of the volume, surface area and number of structures forming per minute in this study shows that CLICs provide the vast majority of constitutive endocytosis, up to four times the capacity of the clathrin mediated endocytic (CME) pathway. As the equivalent of the entire PM area could pass through the CLIC pathway within 12 minutes it is evident that CLICs are fundamental housekeepers of bulk membrane internalisation. Thus, they are likely to be central regulators of PM homeostasis and turnover. High-resolution tomography, in conjunction with analysis of CLIC cargo trafficking, identifies these carriers as complex, pleiomorphic structures that sort the bulk of membrane to early endosomes and recycle cargo back to the cell surface. Such vast internalisation combined with an ability to rapidly recycle components quickly attributes the CLIC pathway as a complex sorting station. Isolation of novel cargo and regulators has identified a striking array of proteins now associated with the CLIC pathway for the first time. A significant proportion of identified targets localise to lipid-rafts and recycle from the PM, facets consistent with association to the CLIC pathway. Numerous targets have also been directly implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis by independent groups. Verification of selected cargo, such as CD44, Thy-1 and myoferlin, showing specific internalisation through the CLIC pathway, has provided insight into the sorting ability of the CLIC pathway and links to adhesion turnover and membrane recycling. Consistent with a role in cellular adhesion turnover, it was found that CLICs become polarised within migrating cells. This has shown the first instance of spatial separation between three major endocytic routes, CLICs, caveolae and CME and highlights the important and coordinated roles of multiple endocytic pathways during physiologically significant processes. The specific internalisation of paxillin, Thy-1 and CD44 through CLICs at the leading edge of migrating cells suggests that CLICs rapidly turnover adhesion components for dynamic extracellular sensation during directional cell migration. Indeed, specific ablation of the CLIC pathway significantly impedes cellular migration, implying coordination with CME at the leading edge. This study has defined numerous parameters of the CLIC pathway, developing the current understanding of this poorly defined route and places the CLIC pathway as a unique player during critical cellular processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Endosome</field><field name="subject">Clathrin-independent Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Gpi-anchored Protein-enriched Early Endosomal Compartment</field><field name="subject">Lipid Rafts</field><field name="subject">Membrane Trafficking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of trust in community acceptance of urban water management schemes: A social-psychological model of the characteristics and determinants of trust and acceptance</field><field name="creator">Victoria Ross</field><field name="description">Given the important role that trust plays in acceptance of water management schemes, the current research investigated the characteristics and determinants of trust by developing a social-psychological model of trust in the area of water management and reuse. The research advanced a theoretical understanding of trust by using social identity theory and the relational model of trust as a framework and providing a systematic examination of the relationships between the variables in the hypothesised trust model. The proposed trust model was tested across three potentially different perceived risk contexts; low, medium and high. Analysis through path modelling provided strong support for the hypothesised model. In all three contexts trust in the water authority was a significant predictor of acceptance of the water management scheme, and risk perceptions mediated the relationship between trust and acceptance. In other words higher levels of trust in the authority were associated with lower perceptions of risk, which were in turn associated with higher levels of acceptance. In Study 4, which was set in the high perceived risk context of the proposed indirect potable reuse scheme in Toowoomba, perceptions of risk had the strongest direct effect on acceptance of the scheme, and the trust, risk and acceptance relationship was stronger than it was in the other studies. The relational variables of procedural fairness, identification with one&#8217;s community, ingroup membership of the water authority and a social bond (shared values) with the water authority were all found to impact on trust, either directly or indirectly. In addition, the instrumental variable of the credibility of the authority (measured as technical competence and a lack of vested interests) was found to have a significant impact on trust. Taken together, the results provide support for social identity theory and the relational model of trust as a framework for understanding trust in authorities. The results are also consistent with literature that suggests that the relational and instrumental models of trust are not incompatible (e.g., Edwards &amp; Kidd, 2003; Tyler &amp; Kramer, 1996). The findings from this research program clearly have a practical application for improving acceptance of water management schemes. The combined results demonstrate the importance of trust in the water authority in reducing perceived risk and thus increasing acceptance of schemes. The results highlight the need for water authorities and policy makers to build public trust through procedural fairness, building a sense of the water authority as a member of the community, and through demonstrating technical competence and concern for the interests of the public.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trust, risk perceptions, public acceptance, recycled water, social identity, procedural fairness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Career Pathways for Elite Coaching: A Study of Australian Softball Coaches</field><field name="creator">Kathryn Horton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the attributes and experiences that are perceived priorities for recruitment to become a high performance coach in the sport of Softball in Australia. The study was undertaken in the form of 10 cases of nationally identified coaches and administrators (men and women). Each participant was interviewed using semi-structured questions. The interpretive study gave an intensive description and analysis of coach experiences, attributes and qualifications that are perceived as highly desirable for coach selection by Softball Australia for high performance coaches. The basis for collection and analysis of information was via individual cognitive perspectives and perceptions (through interviews) and individual behaviours (through observation) with the intention to interpret and consider the presence of common themes. Findings may serve to identify, support and direct potential high performance coaches and contribute to the effectiveness of formal coaching education programs. The study focused on the sport of softball which has had a mixed profile over time, from one of almost obscurity to that of an Olympic sport. Australia has had an extremely impressive record internationally. It is currently ranked as the world&#8217;s best softball nation based on international performances by the Australian under 19 Men, Open Men, under 19 Women and Open Women&#8217;s Teams (SA 2008). Australia was the only country ranked in the top three in all age groups competing in World Championships. The importance of this study to softball coaches was to encapsulate the reality of how selectors make determination on performance coaching selections, and was this in line with what performance coaches perceive as the priorities. This may have two direct effects on the performance coach. Firstly, it may allow the coach to develop a career path that may best suit their qualities and attributes. Secondly, it may allow the coach to undertake further learning and development in the areas that the selectors perceive the coach does not meet the required standard of merit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">elite sports coaching, career pathways, Australian softball</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The &#8216;Historically Informed Performance&#8217; Movement and its Influence on Violoncello Playing Since 1981: With Reference to Performances of Haydn&#8217;s Violoncello Concerto in C major by Anner Byslma, Pieter Wispelwey and Yo-Yo Ma</field><field name="creator">Courtenay Lind</field><field name="description">Investigation of the historically informed performance movement with regard to its influence on violoncello playing since 1981 is approached in this critical commentary through the analysis of three different interpretations of Haydn&#8217;s Cello Concerto in C major. These interpretations are recordings by prominent cellists who have influenced or been influenced by the rise in popularity of the historically informed performance movement, namely Anner Bylsma, Pieter Wispelwey and Yo-Yo Ma. The critical commentary includes a brief summary of the musical careers of each individual and reports on the publicity surrounding them in an attempt to discover each performer&#8217;s views on the importance of historical performance practice and the extent to which these views are reflected in their performances. In order to establish what constitutes a historically informed interpretation of Haydn&#8217;s Cello Concerto, this document provides a brief background to the historical performance movement and also to the work itself. In the critical commentary, this work is analysed in relation to six specific aspects of historically informed interpretation: instrumentation, pitch, vibrato, tempo, ornamentation and cadential improvisation. By examining and comparing these aspects in the aforementioned twentieth-century recordings, this critical commentary concludes in support of Taruskin&#8217;s (1984) position on the now fashionable debate of historical performance practice. Namely, that the historical performance movement has been influenced as much by modern taste and aesthetics as by the attempt to create historically &#8216;accurate&#8217; music.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violoncello</field><field name="subject">historically informed performance practice</field><field name="subject">Bylsma</field><field name="subject">Wispelwey</field><field name="subject">Ma</field><field name="subject">Haydn</field><field name="subject">concerto</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advanced Methodologies for Power System Security and Vulnerability Analysis</field><field name="creator">Guo Chen</field><field name="description">Nowadays, with the rapid expansion of increasing utilization of renewable energy sources, power grid is evolving into a much complex man-made system in the technological age. Under the new circumstances, traditional methodologies for power system security analysis are facing a serious challenge. For the past decade, many countries have experienced large blackouts, which expose potential problems of current models and methodologies in power industry. On the other hand, since the 9.11 event and frequent suicide bombing attacks in some countries, terrorism has become a major threat for national security. With the extensive growth of terrorism activities, power system, the significant critical infrastructure, probably becomes the target of terrorists. If this happens, the impact is dramatically severe and may yield more frequent blackouts. This Ph.D. thesis aims at developing some advanced models and methodologies for exploring the vulnerability of power system and protecting it against potential terrorism threat. The dissertation mainly consists of the following four parts. (1)Complex network theory based power system security and vulnerability analysis methodologies are introduced. Mathematically, an interconnected complex power grid can be described as a complex network of nodes connected by edges. Generally speaking, topology parameters of network structure include important information of the structure. That is to say, some critical nodes and lines can have significant impact on large-scale blackouts. The thesis will present a new methodology to recognize those critical nodes and lines in power grids. (2)Complex system theory based power grid security and vulnerability analysis methodologies are presented. Power grid is a complex dynamic evolutionary system over years with continuous expansion so as to underpin the ongoing increase of power demand. Some properties of complex systems may have important relationship with large-scale blackouts. In other words, there may be some stages of evolutionary power systems that would be more likely to cause large blackouts. The thesis will investigate the relationship to identify those critical stages of power grids. (3)Game theory is applied to methodologies for power system security and vulnerability analysis. Terrorists are often considered as fully intelligent and strategic actors who can even hire scientists and power engineers to seek the vulnerability of power systems and then launch a vital attack. Game theory does treat actors as fully strategic players and has been successfully applied to many disciplines including economics, political science and military. The thesis will present new models and analysis methods for protecting power systems under terrorism attacks. (4)Cyber security technology is considered in power system security and vulnerability analysis. It is known that information technology plays an import role in today and next generation grid. In this situation, cyber security should be an important issue. If it is vulnerable to malicious threats such as hackers and cyber-terrorists, power grid will not reach its full capabilities. The thesis will present an initial framework to reduce the vulnerability of power grid against potential cyber attack.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Complex Networks, Complex Systems, Game Theory, Cyber Security, Vulnerability</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Are Words with Effector Specific Motor Related Meaning Represented Somatotopically on the Motor Cortex?</field><field name="creator">Natasha Postle</field><field name="description">Traditionally, language was proposed to be mediated by various left hemisphere perisylvian structures and the associated role of the motor cortices was limited to tasks such as articulation. Recent theoretical models have proposed that effector specific words with motor related meaning are represented somatotopically on the primary motor (Brodmann&#8217;s Area 4) and premotor (Brodmann&#8217;s Area 6) cortices. For example, it has been reported that when verbs associated with the hand (e.g., pick) are processed, the primary and premotor areas involved with moving the hand are engaged. However, fundamental methodological problems exist within the reported research. This thesis aimed to address and correct the inconsistencies and methodological limitations within the existing literature to provide more conclusive evidence regarding the involvement of the primary and premotor cortices in processing verbs with motor related meaning. This thesis also aimed to investigate whether the names of effectors (nouns) also involve processing by the motor cortices, either generally or somatotopically. Three behavioural dual task experiments and one fMRI experiment were conducted. Results indicated no evidence of somatotopically organised overlapping activation in the primary or premotor cortex between the various semantic categories of words and related effector movements. However, in the fMRI experiment, motor related verbs in general yielded significant overlapping activity between reading all effector related verbs and moving all effectors in the pre-supplementary motor area of the premotor cortex. These findings indicate that an embodied language involving somatotopic representations of effector specific verbs on the primary or premotor cortex is unlikely to be the case. Rather there appears to be a more general representation of effector related verbs in a more cognitive than motor area of the premotor cortex. The findings of this thesis are consistent a wealth of evidence supporting the motor cortices being generally associated with motor related language and with the idea that semantic representations are distributed throughout the brain according to the embodied cognitive framework, rather than being localised to amodal regions that process all words.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Motor Cortex</field><field name="subject">Somatotopy</field><field name="subject">Language Comprehension</field><field name="subject">Verbs</field><field name="subject">Nouns</field><field name="subject">Dual Task</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Effector Specific</field><field name="subject">Motor Related Meaning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion of the Concept of Sustainable Tourism Development: A Case Study on Kret Island, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Siriphen Dabphet</field><field name="description">Sustainable tourism development is widely accepted as an alternative approach to tourism development in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable in part to a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders&#8217; understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to destination stakeholders as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">sustainable tourism development, diffusion of innovation theory, communication channels, innovation characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional Development through CoPs: A Case Study of EFL Teachers in China</field><field name="creator">Ping Wang</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were to investigate tertiary English language teachers&#8217; needs, experiences, and expectations for PD in oral English discussion strategies, to develop a transformative model of professional development using a CoP framework, and to consider how teachers transformed their learning through completing this PD program. To achieve these aims, a case study was designed that used both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to collect data from multiple sources. Data were collected from: (1) a questionnaire of 30 EFL teachers in the English department of a Chinese university; and (2) interviews with four teachers who volunteered to participate in the CoP; and (3) audio transcriptions of ten professional development meetings, blogs and follow-up electronic interviews six months later. These data were analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The key findings from the analysis of the teacher PD questionnaires and preliminary interview responses showed that although the English teachers in the research site lacked PD experience, they had positive perceptions and expectations for PD activities. However, it was found that PD activities that the respondents had previous attended had been mainly trainer-centred and not relevant to their actual classroom teaching. The teachers reported a need for more opportunities to work with their peers in groups, and for professional development more closely aligned with their needs that considered their other professional commitments and workloads. Based on these findings, a PD program using a Communities of Practice framework was designed to assist teachers to develop new strategies for teaching English oral language skills. Analysis of the transcripts from the PD meetings, post-PD interviews, and electronic interviews revealed that the process of PD implementation was more complex than the initial framework had suggested. First, the outcomes after the implementation of the model varied more than anticipated. The teachers negotiated meanings to enable them to introduce new practices, persisted with their old practice, and adapted, rather than directly adopting, activities. Second, the teachers&#8217; change in practice was smaller than anticipated. Third, the teacher change related to thinking as well as practice. The PD model using a CoP framework was then refined and extended based on these findings. The study also reported an individual case study of one participant&#8217;s (Yang&#8217;s) learning in the PD program. It was found that Yang went through a significant evolution in her learning. She came to the program as an &#8220;outsider&#8221; and a listener who was willing to learn new practice from the other teachers. She experienced various cycles during which she implemented what she learned in the meetings and achieved transformation, which included both adaptation and adoption of new strategies in her teaching. The findings revealed that the process of teacher transformative learning in a CoP was complex, cyclical and requires further facilitation and extended participation in face-to-face group activities. Implications were drawn from these findings about directions for future research including: further research in the Chinese context for deeper understanding of teacher transformative learning in PD, and further research on implementing the model in other contexts to explore teachers transformative PD and to investigate the possibility of extending this model to a larger context. This study is an example of how a professional development model using a Community of Practice framework could be implemented for EFL teacher transformative learning in one Chinese university. The study proposed a model, then refined and extended this model which might be applied to other research contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Teacher professional development, Communities of Practice, China, EFL teacher</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational study of proteins with paramagnetic NMR: Automatic assignments of spectral resonances, determination of protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes, and structure determination of proteins</field><field name="creator">Christophe Schmitz</field><field name="description">Understanding biological phenomena at atomic resolution is one of the keys to modern drug design.

These techniques can also determine the binding mode of chemical compounds. Either technique can be slow and costly, making it highly relevant to explore alternative strategies. Paramagnetic NMR spectroscopy is emerging as such an alternative technique. In order to measure the paramagnetic effects, two NMR spectra are compared that have been measured with and without a bound paramagnetic metal ion. In particular, pseudocontact shifts (PCS) of nuclear spins are easily measured as the difference (in ppm) of the chemical shifts between the two spectra. PCSs provide long range and orientation dependent restraints, allowing positioning of the spin with respect to the magnetic susceptibility tensor anisotropy (&#916;&#967;-tensor) of the metal ion. In this thesis, I used the PCS effect to computationally extract information from NMR spectra. I developed (i) a tool (called Possum) to automatically assign diamagnetic and paramagnetic spectra of the methyl groups of amino acid side chains, given structural information of the protein studied and prior knowledge of the &#916;&#967;-tensor; (ii) I designed a comprehensive software package (called Numbat) to extract &#916;&#967;-tensor parameters from assigned PCS values and the available 3D structure; and (iii) I incorporated PCS-based restraints into the protein structure prediction software CS-ROSETTA and demonstrated that this combination (PCS-ROSETTA) presents a significant improvement for de novo structure determination. The three projects serve different purposes at different stages of protein NMR studies. They could be combined in the following manner: Starting from assigned backbone PCSs, PCS-Rosetta could be used to determine the 3D structure of the protein. Possum can then be used to automatically assign the NMR resonances of the methyl groups using PCSs. Finally, Numbat can be used to fit improved &#916;&#967;-tensors to all the PCS data, analyze the quality of the &#916;&#967;-tensors and identify possible wrong assignments. Iterative repetition of this protocol would give a 3D structural model of the protein with a minimum of data. Alternatively, the &#916;&#967;-tensor parameters and PCSs could be used as input for a traditional software package such as Xplor-NIH to compute a 3D structure of the protein.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">paramagnetic NMR</field><field name="subject">pseudocontact shift</field><field name="subject">Lanthanide</field><field name="subject">magnetic susceptibility tensor</field><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">Structure Determination</field><field name="subject">resonance assignment</field><field name="subject">Protein Folding</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The past is a foreign country: A history of the Church of England in the diocese of Brisbane, 1950-1970</field><field name="creator">Holland, Jonathan Charles</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2202 History and Philosophy of Specific Fields</field><field name="subject">Anglican Church of Australia.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The comparative ecology and population dynamics of koalas in the koala coast region of south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jim, (James Athol)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0501 Ecological Applications</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Ecology -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="subject">Koala -- Habitat -- Queensland, Southeastern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Before everything, remain Italian": Fascism and the Italian population of Queensland 1910-1945</field><field name="creator">Brown, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430000 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">Italian diaspora</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Queensland history</field><field name="subject">Fascism</field><field name="subject">Ethnic politics</field><field name="subject">Transnationalism</field><field name="subject">Catholicism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of teacher training in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Norman Reid</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers -- Training of -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literature and cultural policy studies</field><field name="creator">Glover, Stuart</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">2001 Communication and Media Studies</field><field name="subject">420202 Australian and New Zealand</field><field name="subject">420302 Cultural Theory</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">Culture -- Study and teaching (Higher) -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Popular culture -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Literature and state -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Publishers and publishing -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A critical appraisal of the inter-relationship of the tourism industry and the wine industry: An analysis of wine tourism on the Granite Belt area in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Catherine M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1506 Tourism</field><field name="subject">070604 Oenology and Viticulture</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Wine industry -- Queensland.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership development in Queensland Christian Brothers schools</field><field name="creator">McManus, Brendan</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">130211 Religion Curriculum and Pedagogy</field><field name="subject">2204 Religion and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">Christian Brothers, Irish -- Education -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Catholic schools -- Queensland -- Administration.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evan Mackenzie : pioneer merchant pastoralist of Moreton Bay / John H.G.

name="title">Molecular characterization of the CP2-related transcription factor, CRTR-1.</field><field name="creator">To, Sarah</field><field name="description">CRTR-1 is a member of the CP2 family of transcription factors. Unlike other CP2 family members, CRTR-1 expression is regulated developmentally. Major sites of expression in the embryo include the pluripotent inner cell mass (ICM) of the pre-implantation blastocyst and the developing kidney. It is also expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, which are derived from the ICM of blastocysts, and is downregulated as these cells differentiate into early primitive ectoderm-like (EPL) cells. This expression pattern suggests that CRTR-1 plays a role in early pluripotent populations. This thesis aims to characterize the transcription factor CRTR-1 at the molecular level and analyses the role of sumoylation on CRTR-1 function to develop a better understanding of the molecular role of CRTR-1 in ES cells. Luciferase reporter assays show that CRTR-1 is able to regulate the activities of other CP2 family members: CP2, NF2d9 and altNF2d9. It enhances CP2- and NF2d9-mediated activation but suppresses altNF2d9-mediated activation. To map the functional domains in the CRTR-1 protein, transactivation studies using CRTR-1 deletion mutants fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain and a GAL4-responsive reporter system were performed. These studies map repressor activity to amino acids 48-200, but fail to identify a transactivation domain within the CRTR-1 protein. In order to understand the mechanisms by which CRTR-1 regulates the transcriptional activities of CP2 family members, a number of approaches are taken, including co-immunoprecipitation to show that CRTR-1 interacts with other CP2-like proteins, EMSA which demonstrate that CRTR-1 forms DNA binding complexes with CP2 family members, and subcellular protein localisation studies which reveal the ability of CRTR-1 and other family members to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm via a CRM1-dependent pathway. In addition, the subcellular localisation of CRTR-1 appears to be cell type specific, with an exclusively nuclear localisation pattern in ES cells, a predominantly cytoplasmic localisation pattern in HEK293T cells, and a cytoplasmic and nuclear speckle localisation pattern in COS-1 cells. Co-expression of CRTR-1 with CP2 or NF2d9 results in the re-localisation of CRTR-1 to the cytoplasm in ES cells. The sumoylation enzymes Ubc9 and PIAS1 have previously been identified as CP2-interacting proteins (Kang et al., 2005a). Given the identification of two potential sumoylation sites within CRTR-1, FK&#179;&#8304; QE and LK&#8308;&#8310; &#8308;AE, and the ability for sumoylation to regulate transcription factor function, the possibility that CRTR-1 is regulated by sumoylation is investigated in this thesis. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that CRTR-1 is modified by SUMO-1 and that lysine 30 is the critical residue for this modification. Mutation of lysine 30 to alanine, which abolishes CRTR-1 sumoylation, results in enhancement of transactivation by CRTR-1, suggesting that sumoylation of CRTR-1 blocks maximal activation. Unexpectedly, however, overexpression of Ubc9, PIAS1, or SUMO-1 results in enhancement of CRTR-1 transcriptional activity, indicating that a more complex mechanism of regulation of CRTR-1 activity is likely. This thesis presents several novel properties of CRTR-1 and other CP2 family members, including the ability of CRTR-1, previously characterized as a repressor, to activate transcription. It is also the first demonstration that CP2 proteins are regulated by sumoylation and that they shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm via a CRM1-dependent mechanism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CP2 transcription factors; sumoylation; embryonic stem cells</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phyto-exploration in arid subtropical, arid mediterranean and tropical savanna environments: biogeochemical mechanisms and implications for mineral exploration.</field><field name="creator">Reid, Nathan</field><field name="description">Vegetation sampling is an effective exploration technique in areas of transported cover where other techniques have been of limited success. Several plant species were sampled along transects across 9 known Au ore bodies; Triodia pungens was found give a Au, As, &#177;Zn, &#177;S, &#177;Ce and &#177;La signature which represented mineralisation through cover materials and Eucalyptus brevifolia was found to give a geobotanical and &#177;Ca, &#177;Mg, P, S and Zn signature of underlying geological structure. The Hyperion prospect was used as a &#8216;blind&#8217; target as there was no background information available until after interpretation was carried out. Mineralisation was located at the contact between granite and dolerite, biogeochemical signatures from E. brevifolia and Acacia bivenosa showed areas of change in &#177;Au, Ba, Ce, &#177;Cu, La, &#177;Mn, Nd, P, S, Sm, Y and Zn which corresponded to this contact. All species in the Pine Creek Orogen were able to present areas elevated in Au, As, &#177;Zn, &#177;S, &#177;Mo and &#177;Cu which provide future drilling targets. Biogeochemical sampling was able to determine the location of mineralisation at each site and identify underlying substrate changes, however, background knowledge relating to regolith, geology, hydrology and geophysics are important in aiding the interpretation of the elemental data as each component of the substrate influences the elements which a plant will uptake. Mineral exploration in Australia has been driven by the search for large ore deposits close to the surface. This has led to the need to develop technologies for detecting mineral deposits under cover, which can be up to several hundred metres of transported sediments. The aim of this research was to test the feasibility of using vegetation biogeochemical sampling over known Au deposits within semi-arid and arid terrains. Biogeochemical sampling has the advantages of being cost effective, sustainable, environmentally friendly and relatively easy to perform. Nine field sites were covered, 4 in the Tanami Region (Coyote, Larranganni, Hyperion and Titania), 4 in the Pine Creek Orogen (Johns Hill, Great Northern, Glencoe and McKinlay) and 1 in the Gawler Craton (Tunkillia). At each of these sites the dominant species were sampled and the elemental concentrations of the plant were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to test if they were able to detect buried mineralisation. In general, all species identified as being deep rooted (larger trees, paperbarks and spinifex) were able to detect mineralisation in each location within multi-element dispersion haloes centring over the projected ore body. Variations were dependant upon species differences and root structures, groundwater influences, and the potential for detrital contamination. In arid Australia, Triodia spp. were shown to be ideal for closely spaced tenement/prospect scale exploration, and Heteropogon spp. show similar trends for the humid tropics. Eucalyptus/Corymbia spp. are more suitable for widely spaced regional sampling exploration as they amalgamate a wider signal with strong groundwater influences. It was found that all plant species were effective at expressing buried mineralisation in a multi-element suite (pathfinders: Au, As, S, Zn, +(Ce/La), _Mo and _Cu) through cover in these terrains provided care was taken with sampling and interpretation. Regolith materials, botanical properties and landforms are essential background knowledge for determining the effectiveness of biogeochemical sampling. Plants with deep root systems with little lateral spread are ideal for prospect/tenement mineral exploration programs, and plants with wide lateral spreads and large chemical uptake potentials are ideal for regional mineral exploration programs. This exploration strategy would be quick, sustainable and relatively cheap compared to other methods of exploration. This is not to say that biogeochemical sampling would be the only tool needed for further mineral exploration in Australia. This process would work best if used in conjunction with other sampling methods like geophysics and some soil sampling techniques.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biogeochemistry; Tanami; spinifex; Triodia; phyto-exploration; mineral exploration; Pine Creek; Tunkilla; Acacia; Melaleuca</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and functions of the novel membrane-spanning four-domains, subfamily a member HCA112.</field><field name="creator">Parker, Wendy</field><field name="description">Members of the membrane-spanning four-domains, subfamily A (MS4A) family are small polypeptides that share the structural features of four-transmembrane domains and unevenly sized extracellular loops. The family includes CD20, Fc&#949;RI&#946; and HtM4, plus a number of relatively uncharacterised proteins / predicted proteins. MS4A proteins are discussed in relation to other protein families, such as the tetraspanins, that are also characterised by four-transmembrane domains. The aim of this study was to identify the cell and tissue distribution, subcellular localisation, and function of a newly discovered member of the MS4A family, hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 112 (HCA112). At a subcellular level, HCA112 was found on the plasma membrane of transfected COS-7 cells, and also within the Golgi complex, trans-Golgi-network, and early endosomes. The molecule is orientated such that the large loop is extracellular and the Nand C-terminal domains are cytoplasmic. The presence of HCA112 associated with components of the endocytic pathway raised the question of whether some originated from the surface membrane. Antibody was used to label a HA epitope tag engineered into the large extracellular loop of HCA112, and the bound antibody was tracked through early endosomes to the recycling compartment. Here it co-localised with internalised transferrin, indicating strongly that HCA112 is internalised via clathrin-dependent mechanisms. Several endocytic sorting motifs within the intracellular domains of HCA112 were investigated for their ability to direct internalisation of HCA112. Deletion of a di-leucine motif was found to slow but not prevent endocytosis, suggesting that it is involved in endocytosis of HCA112, although not essential for the process. When HCA112 expression constructs featuring N- and C-terminal domain truncations were examined, it was found that the N-terminal tail does not affect the subcellular localisation or trafficking of HCA112, while deletion of the C-terminal intracellular domain resulted in retention of the mutant protein in the ER. HCA112 has a wide tissue distribution and is highly expressed in the lining/covering and parenchymal epithelium of some tissues, proximal renal tubules, ductal epithelium in a number of organs, endothelial cells, some steroidogenic endocrine cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, follicular dendritic cells and macrophages. The expression of HCA112 by a wide range of cell types suggests that its function(s) has general importance and is not limited to any specific cell type(s). After reflection on the functions of the HCA112-expressing cells, a common theme that emerged was one of endocytic activity. This lead to speculate that one function of HCA112 might be related to uptake of macromolecules, for instance, in antigen processing and presentation. This might be a general function, such as facilitating uptake of other cell membrane proteins, or directing the traffic of endocytic vesicles. It was noted that HCA112 has a similar cell and tissue distribution to the scavenger receptor and fatty acid translocase FAT/CD36 (Zhang et al., 2003). Furthermore, in cells co-transfected with HCA112 and FAT/CD36, the two molecules co-localise in early endosomes and co-immunoprecipitate, suggesting that the molecules physically and spatially associate. Thus, HCA112 could be involved with (or complement) FAT/CD36 in its functions as a long chain fatty acid transporter and scavenger receptor. A proteomics study of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with HCA112 detected putative interactions with a number of proteins. These included LR8, transferrin receptor, interferon induced transmembrane proteins 2 and 3, Calpain-6, stomatin, PDGF &#945; receptor, and heat shock 70 kDa protein 8 (HSPA8, formerly known as clathrin un-coating ATPase). Of these, LR8 and the transferrin receptor were investigated in more detail. The results provide strong evidence that HCA112 forms a novel complex with LR8, and that this may be involved in macromolecule internalisation or trafficking of membrane proteins, such as FAT/CD36 or the transferrin receptor. In the case of the transferrin receptor, this traffic appears to involve the clathrin-dependent pathway, but it is possible that when HCA112 is associated with FAT/CD36, it functions within lipid raft domains.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endocytosis; transmembrane protein; HCA112; MS4A; hepatocellular carcimoma-associated antigen HCA112</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient sensing mechanisms in the small intestine : localisation of taste molecules in mice and humans with and without diabetes.</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Kate</field><field name="description">The mucosa of the small intestine is clearly able to discriminate specific chemical components of ingested meals to stimulate gastrointestinal feedback pathways and reduce further food intake. Luminal carbohydrates delay gastric emptying and initiate satiation, which are mediated by reflexes via the vagus nerve upon activation of vagal afferent endings in the mucosa. Nutrients activate these nerve fibres through intermediary epithelial cells, which release neuromediators upon transduction of luminal signals through the apical membrane. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are released from enteroendocrine cells in response to luminal carbohydrates and both slow gastric emptying and inhibit food intake via vagal afferent pathways. The molecular mechanisms for carbohydrate detection and transduction leading to 5-HT and GLP-1 release are unknown. However molecules key to transduction of taste by receptor cells in the lingual epithelium are expressed in the gastrointestinal mucosa. The studies in this thesis aimed to investigate 1) the possibility that taste molecules expressed in the intestine form part of the carbohydrate sensing pathway that leads to 5-HT and GLP-1 release, which in turn activate mucosal vagal afferents and 2) to gauge any alterations in taste molecule expression that may relate to adaptation of carbohydrate-induced gastric motility reflexes that occurs in dietary and disease states. Firstly these studies show key taste molecules, including sweet taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3, the Gprotein gustducin (alpha-subunit G&#945;gust), and the taste transduction channel TRPM5, are expressed in the mouse gastrointestinal mucosa shown by RT-PCR and were further localised to individual epithelial &#8216;taste&#8217; cells using immunohistochemistry. Quantification of transcript levels by real time RT-PCR revealed the proximal small intestine as the preferential site of sweet taste receptor expression along the gastrointestinal tract. This finding was also confirmed in humans using gastric and intestinal mucosal biopsies obtained at enteroscopy with significantly higher transcript expression levels in the small intestine compared to stomach. In the mouse, double label immunohistochemistry with G&#945;[subscript]gust antibody, as a marker of intestinal taste cells, was performed using lectin UEA-1, a marker of intestinal brush cells, and 5-HT or GLP-1 to link intestinal taste transduction to 5-HT and GLP-1 release. Results show G&#945;[subscript]gust is expressed within a subset of all three cell types in the small intestine but predominantly within UEA-1-expressing cells. Although G&#945;[subscript]gust, 5-HT and GLP-1 are largely expressed in mutually exclusive cells, within the jejunum a portion G&#945;gust positive cells coexpressed 5-HT or GLP-1. This Indicates a subpopulation of intestinal taste cells may be dedicated to carbohydrate-evoked gastrointestinal reflexes through 5-HT and GLP-1 mediated pathways, however, taste transduction within the small intestine appears to predominantly link to alternate mediators. After nutrient detection at the luminal surface, activation of mucosal afferents by 5-HT released from enterochromaffin cells is well documented, however although vagal afferents express GLP-1 receptors direct activation has not been demonstrated. For this purpose the effects of GLP-1 on gastrointestinal vagal afferents were investigated through single fibre recordings in in vitro tissue preparations. GLP-1 had no effect on the activity of mouse gastroesophageal vagal afferents but a rat duodenal preparation proved too problematic to be able to test GLP-1 specifically on duodenal vagal afferents. Altered gastric motility in response to carbohydrate meals due to prior dietary patterns and diabetes mellitus suggest adaptation in feedback mechanisms. Towards the second aim of this thesis taste molecule expression was quantified in fed and fasted mice by real time RT-PCR and revealed taste gene transcription is altered with the changing luminal environment, specifically transcription of taste genes was significantly decreased after feeding compared to the fasted state. Studies comparing expression in the duodenum of type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic controls show no significant difference in taste transcript levels between the two groups. However taste molecule expression was correlated to blood glucose levels in diabetics suggesting transcription of these signal molecules is adapted to both luminal and systemic carbohydrate levels. Findings in both the mouse and human gastrointestinal tract in terms of intestinal chemosensing are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastrointestinal chemosensation; taste molecules; enteroendocrine cells; vagal afferent</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern recognition and tomographic reconstruction with Terahertz Signals for applications in biomedical engineering.</field><field name="creator">Yin, Xiaoxia (Sunny)</field><field name="description">Over the last ten years, terahertz (THz or T-ray) biomedical imaging has become a modality of interest due to its ability to simultaneously acquire both image and spectral information. Terahertz imaging systems are being commercialized, with increasing trials performed in a biomedical setting. Advanced digital image processing algorithms are greatly need to assist screening, diagnosis, and treatment. Pattern recognition algorithms play a critical role in the accurate and automatic process of detecting abnormalities when applied to biomedical imaging. This goal requires classification of meaningful physical contrast and identification of information in images, for example, distinguishing between different biological tissues or materials. T-ray tomographic imaging and detection technology contributes especially to our ability to discriminate opaque objects with clear boundaries and makes possible significant potential applications in both in vivo and ex vivo environments. The Thesis consists of a number of Chapters, which can be grouped in to three parts. The first part provides a review of the state-of-the-art regarding THz sources and detectors, THz imaging modes, and THz imaging analysis. Pattern recognition forms the second part of this Thesis, which is represented via combining several basic operations: wavelet transforms and wavelet based signal filtering, feature extraction and selection, along with classification schemes for THz applications. Signal filtering in this Thesis is achieved via wavelet based de-noising. The ultrafast pulses generated terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), which is demonstrated to justify their decomposition in the wavelet domain as it can provide better de-noising performance. Feature extraction and selection of the terahertz measurements rely on observed changes in pulse amplitude and phase, as well as scattering characteristics of several different types of powder samples under study. Additionally, three signal processing algorithms are adopted for the evaluation of the complex insertion loss function of such samples as lactose, mandelic acid, and dl-mandelic acid: (i) standard evaluation by ratioing the sample with the background spectra, (ii) a subspace identification algorithm, and (iii) a novel wavelet packet identification procedure. These system identification algorithms enable THz measurements to be transformed to features for THz pattern recognition. Meanwhile, a novel feature extraction method involving the use of Auto Regressive (AR) and Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARMA)models on the wavelet transforms of measured T-ray pulse responses of ex vivo osteosarcoma cells as well as other biomedical materials is presented. Classification schemes are carried out via simple and robust schemes, such as the linear Mahalanobis distance classifier, and the non-linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In particular, SVMs are used as a learning scheme to achieve the identification of two classes of RNA samples and multiple classes of powered materials. Coherent terahertz detection hardware&#8212;THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)&#8212;is used to obtain all the data for validation of these classification schemes. The past decade has witnessed the tremendous development of terahertz instruments for detecting, storing, analysing, and displaying images. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a broadband technique that generates and detects THz radiation in a synchronous and coherent manner. By contrast, the newly developed THz quantum cascade laser is a narrow-band radiation source that provides potential for realising compact systems; they produce image data with higher average power levels. The third part of this Thesis discusses methods to improve the capability of both broad and narrow-band terahertz imaging, driven by computer-aided analytical techniques. A wavelet based reconstruction algorithm for terahertz computed tomography is represented to show how this algorithm can be used to rapidly reconstruct the region of interest (ROI) with a reduction in the measurements of terahertz responses, compared with a standard filtered back-projection technique. These reconstruction algorithms are applied to the analysis of acquired experimental data and to locally recover the two dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structures of several optically opaque objects. Moreover, a segmentation technique based on two dimensional wavelet transforms is investigated for the identification of different materials from the reconstructed CT image.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pattern recognition; Tomographic reconstruction; Terahertz radiation; Wavelet transform; Segmentation; Quantum cascade laser</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BGP, not as easy as 1-2-3.</field><field name="creator">Flavel, Ashley</field><field name="description">The Internet is literally an &#8220;Inter-Network&#8221;, that is, a network of networks. Networks can be entities including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), universities and commercial enterprises. Every network or Autonomous System (AS) has individual requirements, restrictions and capabilities to transit data traffic. No central controlling body determines how ASes connect&#8212;instead contractual agreements are established between AS pairs to govern their relationship. It is not feasible for all ASes to be physically connected to all others. Consequently, some ASes provide transit between other ASes. Such a service usually results in remuneration from one or both ASes. Unlike centrally administered networks where all nodes in the network make generic, predictable decisions, each AS has the ability to select its best route based on its own proprietary commercial agreements. Such agreements are converted to a technical policy implemented in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The ability to implement policies ensures the commercial viability of the Internet, but also makes the prediction of routes difficult and even more worrisome, conflicting policies can cause undesirable BGP states where no single AS has sufficient knowledge to understand what is happening [43]. Designing new clean-slate routing protocols is one approach to improving the predictability and reliability of the Internet. However, due to the Internet&#8217;s distributed political and administrative control, significant collaboration is required to implement a new routing protocol &#8212; especially when no new protocol currently proposed has sufficiently superior flexibility, scalability or robustness. The difficulty in implementing new and improved protocols is evident in the deployment of IPv6 [23]. Although the IPv6 standard has been defined for over a decade and offers a larger address space, better security and embedded quality of service in comparison to traditional IPv4, its deployment is limited to 1200 of over 30000 ASes in the Internet [66]. Hence, it is crucial practical solutions to current problems are evolved in addition to developing clean-slate techniques. Consequently, our approach is pragmatic &#8212; designing tangible solutions to practical problems that can be implemented immediately. In this thesis we examine and combine eBGP, iBGP, OSPF, Netflow and router configuration data to discover important aspects of routing. It is this investigation that instigated the development of a model of iBGP. iBGP is the version of BGP implemented within ASes to propagate routes between internal routers. It exists on a logical topology, however it interacts with the physical topology. It is this interaction which can cause persistent oscillation [49] &#8212; a system state where routers alter their decision ad infinitum. Detecting configurations which can cause this oscillation is NP-hard [49]. However, our model of iBGP introduced in this thesis benefits from the &#8216;designed&#8217; structure of the iBGP topology to restrict the search space dramatically to one that is computationally feasible. iBGP data &#8212; which is collected to analyze router decisions &#8212; is often only collected on a subset of routers due to its massive storage requirements. In addition there is a substantial amount of correlation between router decisions. Our model of iBGP discovers the dependencies between router decisions and can consequently predict the decisions of those routers for which no measurements are available. It does not rely on any assumption of operator configuration, and subsequently is able to be applied in any network scenario &#8212; not just the one originally configured. It is this feature, together with the model&#8217;s ability to use any available measurement data that makes our technique ideal for network measurement and management applications. We found our model is efficient and accurate on the network of a large Tier-2 AS, where all but seven of over 12:7 million decisions were consistent with observed data. Further we were able to predict the decision of 85% of routers where observed data was unavailable. During our analysis, we also identified several minor configuration errors on operational routers when we predicted the &#8220;correct&#8221; outcome. The internal state of a network can be influenced by neighboring ASes. Peering agreements are closely guarded due to their commercially sensitivity. They are implemented in BGP in the form of policies and are difficult to infer with publicly available data sources. We examined the peering policies of over 100 ASes from the perspective of a large Tier-2 AS, finding 22% differ from the canonical peering policy outlined in many peering agreements. When a policy differes from the canonical peering policy, it may result in sub-optimal routing within the Tier-2 AS. We used our model of iBGP to firstly predict the decisions of all routers under the current peering policy, before determining the changes that would have occurred under a canonical peering policy. This analysis not only provided a metric for the routing impact of a peers&#8217; non-canonical policy, but subsequently used in combination with traffic data allowed us to determine the influence of the peer on traffic flows. Our techniques described allow an AS to fully quantify the impact of a non-canonical peering policy and adapt business arrangements appropriately. Throughout our analysis of BGP data, we noticed several inconsistencies in the data. Although the results in the above work were insensitive to such inconsistencies, other applications requiring accurate, fine time-scale analysis of the routing state are much more sensitive. Consequently, we undertake a self-consistency check on the BGP data and examine the possible causes of such inconsistencies. We also present a mechanism to &#8216;clean&#8217; the data to minimize the effects of any inconsistency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Internet; routing; BGP</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language ecology and language planning in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand.</field><field name="creator">Oupra, Simmee</field><field name="description">'Language Ecology and Language Planning in Chiang Rai, Thailand' had three main aims: to study the language ecology and sub-ecologies of Chiang Rai province, to study the factors and forces that affect the language ecology, and to study language plans and language policies in Chiang Rai. This study employed two main frameworks: theoretical and methodological framework. The theoretical construct is based on a parameter rich linguistic theory, Ecolinguistics, where concepts and parameters from linguistics and non-linguistics disciplines are employed. The parameter rich theory assists immensely in the understanding of language as it believes that language is interconnected with the world and the world with language. The study was conducted using ethnography as the methodological framework due to it allowing a wide array of data collection methods which include document studies, observation, participant observation, recorded and unrecorded interviews, personal communications and field notes. Moreover, ethnography provided an opportunity to reflect on the researcher's multiple identities and in varying degrees as insider and outsider. Data collection was conducted in Chiang Rai and six villages in three districts; two districts in the Greater Mae Khong Subregion (G1-IS) area namely Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen; and one district in a special economic border zone area Maesai district. The districts were chosen based on economic influences while the six villages were randomly selected. The villages studied were Wiang Mok and Huay Kok villages in Chiang Khong district; Sop Ruak and Santhaat villages in Chiang Saen province; and Phamee and Payaang Chum in Maesai district. Data were also collected from stakeholders concerned in language planning namely government and nongovernment organizations. There were two main findings in accordance with the research aims. Firstly, it was found that the language ecology and sub-ecologies of Chiang Rai province and the villages were dynamic and multiplex. The dynamics and complexities of the ecology and sub-ecologies wee dependent on numerous interactions of different factors and forces. The factors were social educational, geographical, economic, and political/geopolitical. There were four main levels of forces: world level, national level, regional/provincial level, and home level. The interaction of forces could be positive, negative or neutral to the health of the language ecology. Secondly, with regards to language planning and policy, it was found that there was no explicit minority language policy or planning in Thailand. Two types of language policy were found in Chiang Rai and Thailand: a top-down policy and quasi-bottom up policy. Both policies were education related. The top-down policies were comprised of an implicit national language policy and an explicit foreign language policy, especially for English and Chinese. The quasi-bottom up policy was the only local policy found in Chiang Rai where a Chinese language curriculum was developed at the local level but with a national economic related strategic vision. The study also suggested that future language planning and policies in Thailand should take into account the findings of language ecology and sub-ecologies in Chiang Rai. Language plans should recognise the effect of those factors and forces that will affect other languages within the same ecology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">language ecology; language planning; Lu; Chiang Rai; Thailand; linguistic ecology; Akha; Kammu; Northern Thai; Lamet; Yunnanese Chinese</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signal processing for a brain computer interface.</field><field name="creator">Yang, Ruiting</field><field name="description">Brain computer interface (BCI) systems measure brain signal and translate it into control commands in an attempt to mimic specific human thinking activities. In recent years, many researchers have shown their interests in BCI systems, which has resulted in many experiments and applications. However, most methods are just based on a specific selected dataset or a typical feature. As a result, there are questions about whether some methods generalise well on other datasets. Therefore, the major motivation of this thesis is to compare various features and classifiers described in the literature. Pattern recognition is considered as the core part of a BCI system in our research. In this thesis, a number of different features and classifiers are compared in terms of classification accuracy and computation time. The studied features are: time series waveform, autoregressive (AR) components, spectral components; these are used with different classifiers: such as template matching, nearest neighbour, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Bayesian statistical and fuzzy logic decision classifiers. In order to assess and compare these different features and classifiers, an extensive investigation was carried out on a public dataset (imagined left or right hand movement) from an international BCI competition and the results are reported in this thesis. The classification was done in a continuous fashion, to match a real time application. In this process, the average and best accuracy, as well as the computation time, were analysed and compared. The results showed that most classifiers achieved very high accuracies and short computation times for most features. A BCI experiment based on imagined left or right hand movement was carried out at the University of Adelaide and some investigations on the data from this experiment are discussed. The result shows that the selected classifiers can work well with this new dataset without much additional preprocessing or modifications. Finally, this thesis culminates with some conclusions based on our research, and discusses some further potential work.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brain computer interface; BCI; EEG; Classifier</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a novel subtilase Cytotoxin from Shiga Toxigenic Escherichia Coli.</field><field name="creator">Chong, Damien Christopher Chen Sau</field><field name="description">Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is the prototype of a novel class of AB&#8325; cytotoxins produced by Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC). The A subunit (SubA) is a serine protease that cleaves the ER chaperone BiP causing cell death by a previouslyundetermined mechanism. The B subunits of AB&#8325;toxins typically recognise host cell glycan receptors and direct the subcellular transport of the A subunit. Although the function of SubA and its intracellular substrate have been elucidated, the B subunit (SubB) is relatively uncharacterised. The subcellular trafficking pathway of SubAB was initially examined. SubAB conjugated to Oregon Green 488 (SubAB-OG) was internalised by Vero cells by 5 min, and co-localised with its ER target BiP within 30 min. When Vero cells were incubated with SubAB-OG and either Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated Cholera toxin B subunit (CtxBAF594) or Texas Red-conjugated Shiga toxin B subunit (StxB-TR), individual cells exhibited differential toxin uptake. This was shown to be cell cycle-dependent, in which, SubAB-OG was preferentially internalised by cells migrating through G1 and early S phases. In contrast, CtxB-AF594 was taken up by cells in S through M phases and by a majority of cells in G1, while StxB-TR endocytosis occurred in cells traversing G1. Fluorescent SubAB co-localised with the clathrin marker transferrin, but not with Caveolin-1 (a marker for cholesterol-associated caveolae) and was subsequently trafficked via a retrograde pathway to the TGN, Golgi and ER. The clathrin inhibitor phenylarsine oxide prevented SubAB entry and BiP cleavage in SubAB-treated Vero, HeLa and N2A cells, while cholesterol depletion did not, demonstrating that, unlike either Stx or Ctx, SubAB internalisation is exclusively clathrin-dependent. Identification of the SubB receptor was initially approached using toxin overlay assays in which Vero cell glycolipid extracts were separated by thin-layer chromatography and overlaid with SubAB. SubAB exhibited a high affinity for particular acidic species in the ganglioside fraction. However, none co-migrated with commercial glycolipid standards. SubAB-OG also exhibited an affinity for the oligosaccharide structures of chimeric LPS from GM&#8322; and GM&#8323; bacterial receptor mimic constructs in an LPS toxin overlay assay. Glycan array analysis revealed that SubB possessed a unique affinity for carbohydrate receptors with a terminal Neu5Gc&#945;(2&#8594;3)Gal&#946; disaccharide. Monovalent receptor analogues with distal Neu5Gc or Neu5Gc&#945;(2&#8594;3)Gal&#946; and highly-sialylated &#945;&#8321;-AGP did not prevent endocytosis of SubAB-OG, BiP cleavage or cytotoxicity in Vero cells. This indicated that SubAB has a greater affinity for the host cell receptors than the receptor analogues and may engage multiple receptors displayed on a lipid bilayer. In addition to mediating toxin binding and subcellular trafficking, CtxB and StxB can also potentiate the immune response to co-administered antigen. Accordingly, the systemic immunomodulatory properties of SubB administered by the i.p. route were assessed in mice. Using SubAA&#8322;&#8327;&#8322; as a bystander antigen, SubB significantly increased mouse anti-SubAA&#8322;&#8327;&#8322; titres to levels that were comparable to those obtained using Alum adjuvant. However, when admixed with structurally-unrelated OVA, SubB did not significantly affect anti-OVA titres whereas Alum and CtxB did. This indicated that SubB may function as a systemic carrier protein (rather than an adjuvant) for particular antigens.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AB5; Adjuvant; Carbohydrate; Cell cycle; Immunomodulation; Receptor; Retrograde; Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli; Subtilase cytotoxin; Trafficking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mission accountability: a case study of performance reporting in a large, multi-service community welfare organisation.</field><field name="creator">Saj, Mikolaj Philip</field><field name="description">Community welfare organisations (CWOs)&#185;  perform an important role in society. They are founded on religious or social values that are given expression through their mission statements. In undertaking their work, many command significant economic resources. While the literature shows an increasing use of performance reporting by CWOs, little is known about the processes through which performance reports are developed and deployed. This thesis attempts to fill this lacuna by investigating the structure and process of, and rationale for, performance reporting by a CWO. The research was undertaken through a single organisation case study of performance reporting in a large, multi-service CWO. The study employed an interpretive methodology, which was informed by Strategic Choice Theory, using data that was obtained through interviews, observation of meetings and document analysis. The study found that performance reporting by the organisation was extensive, being undertaken within two distinct but related frameworks: a voluntary system that had been developed within the organisation, and a mandatory system of external reporting. It concluded that performance reporting was essentially the strategic response of a decidedly purposeful, voluntary organisation that chose to operate in a highly regulated welfare system. The contributions to knowledge from this thesis arise from a comprehensive explanation of practice, and a demonstration of the applicability of Strategic Choice Theory to understanding organisational behaviour in a CWO. &#185;  See Appendix 1 for a definition of the term Community Welfare Organisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance reporting; accountability; organisational governance; charity; strategic choice theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Specificity and properties of anti-HLA antibodies associated with renal allograft rejection.</field><field name="creator">Eng, Hooi Sian</field><field name="description">Identification of the complement C4d fragment in peritubular capillaries as a specific marker for antibody mediated rejection in renal transplantation revealed the critical role of antibodies in graft survival. In this thesis, I document the design and findings of studies performed to investigate the clinical impact of anti-HLA antibodies present before and/or after transplantation. Over time, the detection techniques for anti-HLA antibodies has evolved from the less sensitive complement-dependent lymphocytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatching (XM) to more sensitive solid phase assays such as Luminex&#174;. Studies have been conducted to compare the predictive value of different antibody detection techniques. The first result chapter presents antibody specificity in positive CDC B-cell crossmatch (BXM), analysed with highly specific Luminex&#174; assays. The study also investigates the predictive value of BXM in the general transplant population. I found that donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are only present in one third of positive BXM and are associated with poor outcomes. The novel finding is that &gt;80% of the DSA detected by BXM are complement-fixing IgG&#8321; and IgG&#8323; subclasses. Transplant glomerulopathy (TG) is type of chronic renal graft rejection. The pathogenesis of TG is unclear. In the second result chapter, I report risk factors and involvement of anti-HLA antibodies in the development of TG. This study shows that glomerular rejection, delayed graft function, HLA presensitization and DSA have a univariate effect on TG development. Multivariate analysis revealed that DSA are an independent predictor of TG, after adjustment for other risk factors. I have further investigated the role of BXM in a unique, well-matched, highly sensitized patient group transplanted under the national renal exchange programme. I compared Luminex&#174; antibody analysis with BXM in predicting transplant outcomes. In highly sensitized patients, DSA are found in two thirds of positive BXM. In univariate analyses, BXM is associated with humoral rejection whereas DSA defined by Luminex&#174; are associated with total and all rejection types. The major finding is that, by multivariate analysis, DSA defined by Luminex&#174; are an independent predictor of total and humoral rejection, but BXM are not. These interesting findings are reported in the third result chapter. Studies reported in this thesis define the clinical significance of anti-HLA antibodies in renal transplant outcomes. Method comparison studies provide useful information on antibody specificity and their impact on graft survival. Collectively, a better understanding of alloantibodies associated with graft rejection and limitation of antibody detection methods may facilitate donor selection and choice of immunosuppressants, and consequently improve transplant outcomes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HLA; Antibodies; Sensitization; Renal transplantation; B-cell crossmatch; Luminex; Transplant glomerulopathy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative masking and the units problem in audition</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Daniel</field><field name="description">For humans with adequately operating auditory systems the arrival of acoustic waves to the ear and the subsequent displacement of the tympanic membrane gives rise to the sensations and perceptions commonly known as hearing. One aspect of hearing is loudness, to which the field of psychophysics attempts to ascribe a physical correlate intrinsic to the incoming acoustic wave. For over 50 years psychophysicists have attempted to explicitly define the just-noticeable difference (JND) for loudness: the smallest amount, in physical units, that a stimulus needs to be increased to produce a perceptual difference. A review of the literature suggests that the problem in defining the JND is twofold. Firstly there is the measurement problem, with specific weighting on two competing measures of the JND: the level difference (&#916;L) vs. the Weber fraction (&#916;X/X). Deciding between the two measures has proved difficult: within the natural operating range of the auditory system the two measures are directly proportional to one another. Secondly there is the units problem, concerned with the physical unit in which the measure should be expressed. The units problem exists because it has yet to be determined which property of the acoustic stimulus accounts for the perception of loudness. There are several candidates: acoustic pressure (p); acoustic intensity (I); acoustic power (P), and acoustic energy (E). The necessity of determining which, if any, is the proper measure of the stimulus is forced by the phenomenon of negative masking, which is manifest when the stimulus is expressed in terms of pressure. Selecting among the various quantities is complicated by the fact that the four measures are linearly related and constitute a direct transformation of one another. In the laboratory context existing techniques can produce stimuli that severely challenge the auditory system and break down the proportionality exhibited by the various candidate JNDs. These techniques however require greater scrutiny and development. Buus and Florentine (1991) have proposed that the JND measure (i.e., &#916;p/p, &#916;I/I, &#916;L) that realizes a linear relationship with the detectability index, d&#8217;, is the correct measure. The proportionality of the measures makes such comparison complicated, and threshold values need to be inflated by manipulating stimulus parameters in order to exceed the range of proportionality. This is accomplished using short duration (10-ms) sinusoids and low level masking noise. The experimental program commenced with a series of negative masking experiments to ensure the phenomenon is still relevant to short duration stimuli. Laming&#8217;s (1986) sensory analytical model, which assumes the auditory system responds to pressure, provided an acceptable fit to these data. Experiments on the pedestal effect, a related phenomenon, generated fixed-increment functions that could be compared to the masking functions generated from the negative masking data. A consistent relationship between the two was found when the stimuli were expressed in units of pressure. Attention then turned to improving the studies undertaken by Buus and Florentine (1991) to determine what the proper measure of the JND should be. A series of experiments, differentiated by stimulus conditions, suggest a JND measure expressed in pressure units had the most linear relationship with d&#8217;. The results argue for pressure as the correct measure of the stimulus, and &#916;p/p to be the most qualified representative of the JND.

No other external enemy of Rome had the same impact on Roman literature over time as the Carthaginians and their extraordinary general, Hannibal. This thesis compares the presentations of some iconic themes and events associated with Hannibal, as well as some less well known features about him in order to examine how his significance changed over time in Roman culture. The comparisons made in this thesis focus primarily, but not exclusively, on literary features utilised by authors to promote (or downplay) particular events or people, such as the location of an event within the structure of a given text, the utilisation of omens or divine intervention, the patterning and content of speeches, the inclusion or exclusion of certain figures. The thesis aims to trace and compare ancient attitudes and responses to Hannibal, not to reinterpret the history of the Second Punic War or Hannibal&#8223;s career. Roman attitudes toward Hannibal changed over time and ultimately became remarkably positive. Hannibal was, undoubtedly, a terrifying figure to Romans in the third century BC and a serious threat to Rome&#8223;s suzerainty over Italy. Consequently, for many Romans, from at least the first century BC and possibly earlier, Hannibal embodied the archetype for a worthy enemy. His metamorphosis into the epitome of an eternal enemy is a representation which may, as this thesis suggests, have been in part self-promulgated. By the time of the late republic, it suited Roman writers such as Cornelius Nepos to write an astonishingly positive biography of Hannibal, acknowledging his skills as a commander and attributing to him a number of Roman virtues (Nepos, Hannibal, 1-13). Comparing the treatments of a historical subject between genres and over time is of historiographic interest for examining how ancient Roman and Greek authors adapted tradition to suit their particular reading of events. This thesis also argues for some interesting correspondences between what might be considered two quite different modes of presentation of the Second Punic War: Polybius&#8223; narrative history and the Flavian epic of Silius Italicus. Comparison of these texts with Livy, Cornelius Nepos and other works highlights both the dramatised nature of certain sections of Polybius&#8223; Histories, and the frequency with the Punica conveys in its narrative some well-informed interpretation and comment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenging perspectives: an interdisciplinary exploration of urban stormwater management</field><field name="creator">Winz, Ines</field><field name="description">Urban stormwater management must address multiple social-ecological concerns as it adapts  to present challenges and transitions towards sustainability. Concerns for physical stormwater  infrastructure must be investigated and resolved in relation to diverse stakeholder  perspectives. This research explored perspectives and barriers in urban stormwater  management and their roles in the transition to sustainability.  A dynamic simulation was developed to understand the systemic influence of  environmentally friendly solutions on water quality in receiving environments in Project  Twin Streams Catchment, West Auckland, New Zealand. Results showed that  environmentally friendly solutions can reduce but not fully internalise the environmental  impact of stormwater even in a catchment-wide implementation. Failure to integrate socialecological  variables in the modelling process limits the usefulness of the model and the  insights that can be gained. To address this, a qualitative modelling approach was undertaken  that sought to understand pluralist perspectives in stormwater management and barriers that  restrict the uptake of alternative solutions.  Cognitive mapping was used to elicit and capture perceptions on problems and solutions in  urban stormwater management. Three core perspectives were found to underlie contemporary  stormwater management: conventional fixes, low impact solutions, and community  development. These perspectives were diverse and conflicting. Conventional stormwater  management created feedback loops that promoted the continuous construction of  infrastructure to the detriment of environmental systems. Low impact solutions did not break  this feedback loop. Community development failed to address urgent issues due to systemic  delays. Importantly, none of the perspectives by themselves will lead to sustainable  iv  outcomes. This highlighted the need for integration of these different perspectives and  approaches.  Uptake of low impact solutions and community development was found to be hindered by  physical, institutional, logistical and internal barriers. These barriers were caused by, and at  the same time increased, the complexity inherent in stormwater management. Interactions  between barriers were investigated and potential policy interventions suggested guiding  managers in the development of effective policies that support the transition of urban  stormwater management towards sustainability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5897</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth development, Maui styles : Kia tipu te rito o te pa harakeke, Tikanga and ahuatanga as a basis for a positive Maori youth development approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Maori Studies at Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ware, Felicity Jane Rachel</field><field name="description">The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa has been seen as an innovative approach to youth development. The E tipu e rea &#8211; Rangatahi Development Package was particularly useful for organisations implementing the strategy with Maori youth. There have been successful Maori youth development initiatives, though these have been ad hoc. Nonetheless, the realities and experiences of Maori youth are still not being fully addressed in national policy. This has implications for the support and resourcing of Maori youth development initiatives. Maori youth are members of a range of groups including whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities in te ao Maori as well as the wider youth population and New Zealand society. The histories, experiences and viewpoints of each distinct group contribute to diversity in the Maori youth population which presents challenges for Maori youth development. Maori development goals do not adequately focus on Maori youth and youth development theory does not fully consider culture. The challenge is to successfully integrate Maori culture and youth culture in a relevant and meaningful manner so that Maori youth can positively contribute to Maori development and wider New Zealand society. This study examines purakau (narratives) about Maui (Polynesian ancestor) as a template for the analysis of Maori youth development. Interviews were undertaken with a group of Maori youth from the Manawatu region. The research showed tikanga and ahuatanga were relevant to the contemporary daily lives of the participants. The study found that positive development and the realisation of potential for Maori youth was affected by individual and environmental influences.

Nui) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (with Honours) in Plant Biology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Samuel James</field><field name="description">Lolium perenne cv. Nui is a cultivar of ryegrass grown throughout New Zealand in pastures due to favourable traits such as high palatability for livestock and its ability to withstand intensive grazing. However, the productivity of pastures is reduced when levels of aluminium and other metals accumulate in soils to toxic levels, a phenomenon referred to as the &#8216;acid soil syndrome&#8217;. In response to this toxicity, plants activate a series of antioxidant reactions, with one catalysed by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymatic system. The enzyme system comprises three isoenzymes, a Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD and a MnSOD which catalyse the same reaction but differ in amino acid sequence, molecular mass and the metal ion co-factor (hence Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD and MnSOD). Together these isoenzymes combat the damaging effect of superoxide radicals which accumulate due to metal toxicity. In this thesis, the isolation of genes encoding isoenzymes of the SOD enzyme from L. perenne cv. Nui is described. As well, the growth of L. perenne cv. Nui and changes in expression of the SOD genes encoding each isoenzyme in response to aluminium treatment (0.2mM AlCl3) is investigated. A 1072 bp FeSOD gene sequence and a 705 bp MnSOD gene sequence were isolated from shoot tissue of L. perenne cv. Nui using a combination of RT-PCR with degenerate primers and 3'-RACE. The FeSOD gene comprised 572 bp of the coding sequence and 500 bp of 3'-UTR while the MnSOD gene comprised 508 bp of coding sequence and a 197 bp 3'-UTR. By alignment of each sequence with the gene from the database with highest identity it was predicted that the translation start codon (ATG) is located a further 196 bp upstream for the FeSOD gene (aligned with an Oryza sativa FeSOD sequence as a reference) and a further 152 bp upstream for the MnSOD sequence (aligned with a Triticum aestivum MnSOD sequence as a reference). Using RT-PCR with degenerate primers, a 313 bp CuSOD sequence was predominantly cloned from shoot tissue of L. perenne cv. Nui, but it was not possible to generate the 3'-UTR using 3'-RACE. For growth analysis, seedlings of L. perenne cv. Nui were germinated and acclimatised in Hoagland&#8217;s solution, and then subjected to either aluminium treatment (0.2mM  AlCl3) or no treatment to act as a control over a designated time course of 0, 4, 8, or 24 hours. Two growth trials were conducted that differed in the age of seedlings used and plant tissues were separated into root and shoot tissues. Similar growth trends were observed in both trials, but the sampling regime in the second growth trial meant that statistical analysis could be carried out. In this trial, analysis revealed that over a time course of 24 hours exposure to 0.2mM aluminium, both root and shoot tissue fresh weight did not significantly differ when compared to the control (no aluminium). A general trend of an increase in root and shoot fresh weight was observed in plants treated with aluminium, but this trend was not significant at P=0.05. No significant change in fresh weight partitioning from shoot to root, or root to shoot in response to aluminium was also observed. Using semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (sqRTPCR) and primers based around the 3'-UTR with RNA isolated from plants grown in the second hydroponic trial, it was determined that under the conditions used, expression of the FeSOD and MnSOD genes isolated in this study were neither up-regulated or downregulated in response to aluminium treatment in both shoot and root tissue. Further, using degenerate primers to detect expression of one or more genes encoding the Cu/ZnSOD isoenzyme, total expression of the Cu/ZnSOD isoenzyme was also unresponsive to aluminium treatment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">acid soil syndrome</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amputation without anaesthetic : 2004 Network Review : school and community reorganisation : a thesis submitted for the degree of Education doctorate at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Savage, Catherine</field><field name="description">This research investigated a 2004 Ministry of Education-led Education Development Initiative (EDI) known as the Network Review in one district from the perspective of board of trustees members, parents, teachers and students from one school using a case study approach.

The findings indicate this reorganisation was far from realising the outcomes or benefits as predicted by the Ministry of Education. Student learning was not only jeopardised but student safety was also compromised in some settings indicating that there may be long-term implications for students as they express a reluctance to attend the new school, an increased sense of anomie and a lack of interest in learning. The reorganisation workload and stress reported by the BoT and teachers is significant and took a toll on personal wellbeing.

Defining the molecular mechanisms of the striped pattern formation will aid understanding of how a gene can be differentially regulated across a population of similar cells. In the venation phenotype of Antirrhinum majus, the anthocyanin pigment is typically confined to the adaxial epidermal cells overlaying the petal veins. To explore how this pattern forms this study focused on the expression and regulation of Venosa, a Myb regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Pigment complementation experiments demonstrated that the lack of a MYB factor caused the lack of pigment in the cells outside the venation pigmentation domain. An allele of Venosa was isolated and identified. It was a mutant version of functional Venosa due to the central part being replaced by a transposon. Phenotype / genotype analysis indicated that the venation pigmentation patterning was due to the functional Venosa. In situ mRNA hybridisation showed that Venosa was expressed from the xylem to the adaxial epidermis, and was controlled spatially and quantitatively by a signal associated with the petal veins. Venosa expression provided the longitudinal axis for venation pigmentation stripes, and determined the location and intensity of the pigmented cells. Because another factor required for pigmentation, a bHLH factor, is specifically expressed in epidermal cells and it provides the transverse axis. The pigmented stripes are the cross expression domain of these two kinds of factors. The transcriptional controlling property of a 2.4 kb (relative to the ATG) promoter region of the Venosa gene was analysed. The -900 bp fragment was characterised in detail using 5'-end deletion mutagenesis. A heterologous host, tobacco, was used for analysis in stable transgenics. The homologous host, Antirrhinum, was used for transient assays. The efficacy and efficiency of different reporter genes (intron-containing GUS, GFP, Venosa cDNA and genomic Venosa) and enhancement systems (transcriptional enhancer, translational enhancer, inhibitor of post transcriptional gene silencing and a two-step signaling amplification system) for the detection of low-level reporter gene expression were also tested. The strength of expression correlated to the length of the promoter fragment, and expression was detected using deletions down to -500 bp, although only weak expression was found. This expression was flower specific but not vein related in both plant hosts. No expression was detected in petals of either host with fragments shorter than -500 bp. The results suggest that the fragment from -380 bp to -900 bp positively affected Venosa expression at the transcriptional level, but might not be sufficient to define venation. A possibility is that the venation controlling property is negatively controlled at the epigenetic level, such as DNA methylation status and / or chromatin structure. The role of gibberellin and sugar in the pigment and venation patterning formation of Antirrhinum was studied. The results suggest that gibberellin is not required for pigmentation or venation patterning. Convincing evidence on the role of sugar signaling could not be obtained from the experiments, due to the difficulty in separating the impact on pigmentation from other functions of sugars in petal development. In addition, the in situ analysis detected the expression of a gene probably related to aurone biosynthesis that may be a regulatory gene of this biosynthetic pathway.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anthocyanin</field><field name="subject">Venosa</field><field name="subject">Gene regulation</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Support for mothers by early childhood centres : a qualitative study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thesing Winks, Avril Janis</field><field name="description">Mothers have been involved with early childhood centres since their inception.

As well, it reflects the responsibility of institutions such as early childhood centres to fulfil these needs in a society where traditional support has fragmented. The study was designed to explore ways in which support mechanisms operated in four different early childhood services, through the medium of interviews. The unique findings in the study culminated in six propositions that showed support to be a product of mothers' own activity in building relationships and contributing to their centre community. At the same time irrespective of service type all centres operated upon the basis of both formal and informal systems of support. Consequently, whilst mothers' activities were most favoured by socially co-operative environments, they were opportunists in both systems. However, of major concern was that the informal systems were the most effective, as the statement of Desirable Objectives and Practices (Ministry of Education, 1996) exhorts staff to consider parent interactions as partnerships and The Strategic Plan for Early Childhood Education (Ministry of Education, 2002) has a vision of socially co-operative practices. Teachers rather than being unwilling to establish more collaborative styles of leadership were hampered by a lack of confidence in working with parents. Difficulties were the consequence of professional attitudes to trained knowledge, unmodified by the benefits of training to facilitate adults. Addressing these issues will not only help teachers to develop more collaborative systems that will facilitate support for mothers, but it will also ensure partnerships that make better use of their services to the mutual benefit of early childhood centre communities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Early parenting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330110 Early childhood education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Becoming a tertiary teacher in New Zealand : learning in communities of practice : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Viskovic, Alison Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a research project studying how people become tertiary teachers in New Zealand. While studies of many aspects of tertiary teaching, teacher professional development and workplace learning have been published, no comparative study of tertiary teacher development across different types of institutions had been carried out. Few previous studies had linked the concept of learning in a community of practice with teachers' workplace learning. A qualitative, interpretive research framework was adopted, using three case studies. Data were gathered from institutional documents, educational developers and experienced teaching staff of three representative institutions, a polytechnic, a wananga and a university, from mid-2000 to mid-2001. Data gathering strategies included semi-structured interviews with teachers and educational developers, examination of documents, a teacher questionnaire and some class observations. Interview transcripts and other data were analysed to identify common themes, and findings were reported as three individual cases before integration. It was found that most tertiary teachers' learning about teaching and how to teach was in-service, mainly informal and experiential, and the knowledge gained was mainly tacit and process-oriented. Although that was complemented by varying amounts of formal learning, gained through courses or professional development activities, few tertiary teachers have sought or gained teaching qualifications. While institutions have central policies and procedures to support in-service teacher development, their implementation is often uneven, with little integration or balancing of the parts. Differences of practice were observed both between institutions, and between departments within institutions, indicating the importance of context for tertiary teachers' development. It was concluded that non-formal workplace learning is likely to continue to be the mainstay of tertiary teacher development, and that it needs to be refocussed and approached from a fresh angle. The perspective of learning in a community of teaching practice provides a conceptual framework for integrating different levels and forms of support for tertiary teachers. Recommendations for strengthening tertiary teacher development are addressed at three levels: institutions (as social learning systems); communities of practice within those institutions (such as departments, discipline groups, programme teams, or campus whanau); and individual teachers (whose teaching identities develop within those communities).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Teachers' learning</field><field name="subject">Teacher development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330300 Professional Development of Teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of tight junction proteins during engorgement of the mammary gland : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cooper Phyn, Claire Vanessa</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Appendix 6 Cooper, C.

A qualitative study, it takes the experiences of twenty workers from a range of disciplines and environments, and examines their preparation for exposure to extreme stress, their passage through the incidents that they chose to relate, and the organisational response to the events. The central research question explores the knowledge bases currently utilised within trauma and critical incident response, and the degree to which these provide adequate explanatory, practice and evaluation models for responses to workplace incidents. It is examined through the narratives of the mental health workers, who self-define and explore the nature of their preparation for, and experience of, critical incidents and traumatic events in their workplace. The question is contextualised through a review of the knowledge bases of trauma and extreme stress, and of the mental health environment in which the workers practice. A case study of the workplace support known as debriefing illustrates the tensions between current knowledge bases in the area. Informed by this, the key issues of what did or did not work for the participants are explored. The thesis argues that the paradigm shift signalled by the latest developments within conceptualisations of trauma is not yet complete, and that the ensuing tensions have created debate and confusion in the creation of adequate responses to workplace incidents. Whilst conceptualisations that attempt to address issues of complexity and context are evolving, it is argued that an ecological framework has the potential to both explain and respond to incidents that occur within the mental health environment. The findings of the research raise issues of complexity in the design and implementation of appropriate support systems, and lend a perspective to the critique of debriefing that has been missing from existing debates. Key principles for the development of safe and sound support systems, and their evaluation, are developed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extreme stress</field><field name="subject">Organisational response</field><field name="subject">Workplace incidents</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370200 Social Work::370204 Counselling , welfare and community services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A profile and longitudinal evaluation of multiple risk factors, protective factors, and outcomes for suicidal and non-suicidal out-of-home adolescents who applied for the independent youth benefit (IYB) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Narelle</field><field name="description">This research contributes new knowledge to those working in the areas of welfare, child and adolescent safety, and suicide prevention. The aim of this thesis was to succinctly provide clinicians, government and community agencies, researchers and policy advisors, with a snapshot profile of 2029 welfare seeking young people who were homeless and frequently discouraged by negative life events. The research aim was to identify risk and protective factors that impact life outcomes for those seeking the Independent Youth Benefit (IYB), and particularly, to scrutinize salient factors that led a vulnerable group of IYB applicants to die by suicide. It was further aimed that by documenting comments from 200 young adults from this population across a span of seven years, both gaps within the IYB process, as well as useful resources, could be identified in order to improve life outcomes for other homeless youth. For those who attempted suicide and survived, file records and interviews have indicated the triggers and life histories that potentially impacted their decision to try to end their pain of life, and factors that influenced survival and recovery. Four separate studies were included in this thesis. Study 1 profiled 2029 IYB applicants and determined the most potent risks that led to the granting of the IYB. Study 2 revealed the salient factors that related to the suicide of 6 IYB applicants. Study 3 investigated the outcomes for those who were granted or declined a benefit across the variables of education, employment, income, adverse life circumstances, wellbeing, and family relationships. Study 4 examined a psychological construct, termed cynical distrust, which appeared to be a characteristic trait in welfare seeking youth. Conclusions from this research provided indicators of youth who will usually be granted an IYB, they are, those who report bullying, abuse, parent psychopathology, single parent homes, a parent on a benefit and foster placement. Applicants who reported suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts and had contact with Police and Child Youth and Family Services also were more likely to be granted an Independent Youth Benefit (IYB). If the applicants were Maori and had previously seen a counsellor for a mental health problem, they also were more likely to receive the IYB. However, when applicants were referred to Family Reconciliation Counselling (FRC), there was a statistically significant association between benefit application and benefit declined. A unique finding from this population related to the association of 'unknown fathers' with suicide. Absent father literature is now extensive, however, little research has been conducted into the effects of 'unknown fathers', particularly for Maori youth who place much of their strength and wellbeing in their genealogy. Other salient factors leading to suicide for IYB applicants included, previous suicide attempt, co-morbid disorder, unresolved anger, no identified caring adult, foster placement and an impending legal or disciplinary event. Maori males with such factors posed the greatest risk for suicide. Counsellors, psychologists, families and policy analysts need to acknowledge that IYB applicants who attempted suicide, show cynical distrust, and were declined a benefit, had extremely poor life outcomes. The New Zealand youth welfare system could be functioning far more efficiently if documented recommendations become realities.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homeless people</field><field name="subject">Teenage suicide</field><field name="subject">Youth welfare</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380105 Social and community psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small stream ecosystems and irrigation : an ecological assessment of water abstraction impacts : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Ecology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dewson, Zo&#235; Spence</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copy right restriction: Dewson, Z.S., Death, R.G. &amp; James, A.B.W.

The main objective of the research is to formulate a framework for multiplatform e-learning systems. This thesis focuses on the formulation, competency and constitution of the multiplatform e-learning systems framework and the implementation of a multiplatform e-learning system. In conjunction with the main objective, the research also addresses the factors that influence learner satisfaction during their engagement with a multiplatform e-learning system. In addition, the research investigates the relationships between these factors in influencing learner satisfaction. The research also intends to validate the assertion that multiplatform e-learning systems are better than non-adaptive e-learning systems. A comparative evaluation between a traditional e-learning system and a multiplatform e-learning system from end user (learner) perspective was conducted. The evaluation instrument is based on multiplatform e-learning system questionnaires (MELQ). A total of forty participants took part in the evaluation. Four participants took part in the initial pilot evaluation while thirty six participants took part in the final evaluation. Data analysis and statistical results indicate that there are potential gains in learner satisfaction score in multiplatform e-learning systems over traditional e-learning systems. The results also show that the gain is most significant in mobile devices than in desktop PCs. Statistical analysis reveals that all the factors that influence the learner satisfaction are significant and they have different levels of influence over learner satisfaction. These factors can be further organized into primary factors and secondary factors. These findings and the methodology of evaluation can play an important role for e-learning systems designer to improve the adaptation process and to enhance the level of learner satisfaction in multiplatform e-learning systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">End user evaluation</field><field name="subject">Mobile devices in education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280104 Computer-human interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interrelationships between rating agencies, banks and investors : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Finance at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hsu, Wei-Huei</field><field name="description">Bank loan ratings are employed to investigate the interrelationship between the rating agencies and banks. Valuation effects of rating announcements on investors in the market are also examined. Similar functions are performed by rating agencies and banks, however, it is found that investors perceive information provided by rating agencies and banks differently. In the first essay, the results indicate that investors recognise the value of rating agencies in the presence of banks as information providers and monitors. The value of rating agencies relies on their recognition of deteriorating prospects in a firm's financial position, as the market reacts significantly to bank loan rating announcements of placement on CreditWatch with negative implications and downgrades. In the second essay, the results indicate that investors recognise the value of high quality banks in the presence of rating agencies as information providers and monitors. When the deteriorated firms are associated with high quality banks, the negative reaction toward announcements of negative placement and downgrade is mitigated. This indicates that investors are willing to trust high quality banks' speciality in information and monitoring, and reassess the value of deteriorated firms. In the third essay, the results show that the value of rating agencies; via announcements of negative placement and downgrade; also expands to non-rated firms smaller than the rated firms, in the same industry. Announcements of negative placement indicate firm-specific deterioration and, therefore, smaller rival firms benefit from the change in competitive balance. From the announcements of downgrade, however, smaller rival firms experience contagion effect.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit ratings</field><field name="subject">Bank loan ratings</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hear our boys' voices : what hinders and enhances their academic success : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Michael Ray</field><field name="description">Many boys in New Zealand are having difficulty at school and are not reaching or achieving to their potential. Over the last 30 years there has been an increasing gender gap in education with girls outperforming boys in most curriculum areas. More boys are likely to be disciplined, expelled from school, placed in special education programmes and leave school without qualifications, than girls of the same age and ability. The aim of this research was to develop a clearer understanding of boys' learning needs and in the process to develop some strategies for improved pedagogy. To achieve this aim and ensure that boys' voices were heard and accurately recorded, boys were trained to be student researchers and consultants within the study. Schools tend to practice a strategy of silence by denying students voice. However students can be valuable collaborators in research and school improvement when given the opportunity. This thesis recorded the voices of boys from Year level 9, 11 and 13 of three culturally and geographically dissimilar secondary schools. A diverse and broadly representative sample of boys was crucial for the study to establish a boys' perspective on school issues. The methods used to collect boys' experiences and perceptions were individual semi-structured interview, boys' only focus groups and a student motivation measurement. Over 400 boys were involved. This research established that boys could be taught the skills and abilities to make a valuable contribution as researchers and consultants to the research process. The boys were astutely aware of the issues of education within their school and were able to process information in a responsible and honest manner. There was a uniformity of viewpoint between boys from the three schools and Year levels on ways they perceived factors enhance and hinder their learning. In particular, boys love activity and challenge and require it to engage their body and their mind. A key component to teaching boys is the teacher/boy relationship that establishes a mutual respect, individual care and consistency of expectations. A disturbing revelation is that a number of boys believe that teachers and schools do not expect them to achieve as well as girls. This attitude must be addressed by all concerned with boys' education and well being.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boys' academic achievement</field><field name="subject">Boys' learning needs</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and molecular characterisation of FliI and FliH from Helicobacter pylori : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology at the Institute of Molecular BioSciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lane, Michael</field><field name="description">The bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a human pathogen that infects a large proportion of the world's population and is associated with serious diseases such as gastric ulcers and adenocarcinoma. The motility of this organism, by virtue of sheathed polar flagella is essential to colonisation and persistence in the human host. The sequencing of the H. pylori genome in 1996 identified homologues of the majority of the flagellar genes found in S. enterica serovai typhimurium. These included genes encoding the flagellum ATPase, FliI and FliH a presumptive inhibitor, the primary focus of this study. Sequencing did not originally identify an H. pylori homologue of the flagellar chaperone FliJ, and this is also considered in this study. Bioinformatic analysis and modeling suggests a structural and functional relationship between FliI and homologues such as F1-ATPase &#945;- and &#946;-subunit. In particular, residues 2-91 of FliI resemble the N-terminal domain of the F1-ATPase &#945;- and &#946;-subunits. Biochemical analyses reported in this thesis showed that a truncated FliI-(2- 91) protein was folded, although the N-terminal 18 residues were likely unstructured. Furthermore, deletion mutagenesis showed that this disordered segment of the protein mediates interaction with FliH and very likely forms an amphipathic &#945;-helix upon forming of the FliI-FliH complex. The scanning mutagenesis of this interaction segment of FliI identified a cluster of conserved hydrophobic residues that was critical for the interaction with FliH. Thus, the interaction between FliI and FliH has similarities to the interaction between the N-terminal &#945;-helix of the &#945;-subunit and the globular domain of the &#948;-subunit of the F1-ATPase. This similarity suggests that FliH, by analogy with the &#948;-subunit of the F1-ATPase, may function as a molecular stator of the flagellum. The findings presented above have been published (96). The function of a putative H. pylori FliJ homologue, HP0256, was also investigated by knock-out mutagenesis. Disruption of this gene does not abolish flagellar assembly, however further research continued beyond this thesis showed that the knock-out mutant results in impaired motility.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human pathogen</field><field name="subject">Mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional Immunosuppression for Corneal Transplantation</field><field name="creator">Brice, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Corneal transplantation is performed to restore vision or to relieve pain in patients with damaged or diseased corneas. However, approximately 40% of corneal allografts fail after 10 years. The most common cause of graft failure is irreversible immunological rejection, primarily mediated by CD4+ T cells, despite the topical application of glucocorticosteroids. The aim of this project was to investigate the anatomic site of antigen presentation during corneal transplantation in the rat, by using a lentiviral vector to express an anti-CD4 antibody fragment at potential sites of antigen presentation, including the donor corneal endothelium, the anterior segment of the eye and the cervical lymph nodes. 

Dual-gene lentiviral vectors were constructed by inserting the 2A self-processing sequence between two transgenes. This allowed expression of two transgenes within a single open reading frame. In vitro characterisation of the dual-gene vectors was performed in cell culture experiments, which showed that transgenic proteins were expressed at lower levels from dual-gene vectors compared to the expression from single-gene vectors and expression was lowest when the transgene was situated downstream of the 2A self-processing sequence.

To locate the anatomic site of antigen presentation during corneal transplantation in rats, a lentiviral vector carrying an anti-CD4 antibody fragment was delivered to the corneal endothelium either immediately prior to corneal transplantation by ex vivo transduction of the donor corneas, or 5 days prior to corneal transplantation by anterior chamber injection into both the recipient and the donor rats. A separate group of recipient rats received intranodal injections of the lentiviral vector carrying an anti-CD4 antibody fragment into the cervical lymph nodes 2 days prior to corneal transplantation. Another group of rats underwent bilateral lymphadenectomy of the cervical lymph nodes 7 days prior to corneal transplantation. Corneal allografts were scored daily for opacity, inflammation and neovascularisation. Expression of the anti-CD4 antibody fragment from transduced tissues was detected using flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. Modest, but significant prolongation of corneal allograft survival was experienced by rats that received ex vivo transduction of the donor corneas with a lentiviral vector carrying an anti-CD4 antibody fragment immediately prior to corneal transplantation, but all grafts did eventually reject. Anterior chamber injection of the lentiviral vector carrying the anti-CD4 antibody fragment 5 days prior to corneal transplantation into both recipient and donor eyes did not prolong allograft survival. Intranodal injection of a lentiviral vector carrying an anti-CD4 antibody fragment did not prolong the survival of the corneal allografts, nor did bilateral lymphadenectomy of the cervical lymph nodes 7 days prior to corneal transplantation. 

Neither expression of the anti-CD4 antibody fragment in the cervical lymph nodes nor the removal of these nodes was able to prolong corneal allograft survival in rats, suggesting that T cell sensitisation could potentially occur elsewhere in the body. However, expression of the anti-CD4 antibody fragment from the donor corneal endothelium was able to prolong corneal allograft survival, suggesting that some antigen presentation might occur within the anterior segment of the eye. Based on the findings described in this thesis and those of others, I propose that antigen presentation in the rat occurs within anterior segment of the eye and within the secondary lymphoid tissues such as the cervical lymph nodes, and that inhibiting antigen presentation at one of these sites will delay graft rejection. However, to completely abolish antigen presentation during corneal transplantation in the rat, I hypothesise that antigen presentation within both the anterior segment of the eye and within the secondary lymphoid tissues must be inhibited.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corneal transplantation</field><field name="subject">gene therapy</field><field name="subject">lentivirus</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100811.113448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Through the Looking Glass: The Politics of Advancing Nursing and the Discourses on Nurse Practitioners in Australia</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Clare Lynette Eden</field><field name="description">Nursing has a tradition of subservience and obedience. History provides an account of secular and religious orders of nursing shaping a view of virtuous and tireless dedication in carrying out the doctor&#146;s orders. Nurse Practitioners were first introduced to the health care system in the 1960s as a solution to the medical shortage being experienced in United States of America at that time. They assumed clinical tasks, traditionally regarded as doctor&#146;s work. Since then the Nurse Practitioner movement has expanded globally. 

Australia introduced the Nurse Practitioner role in 1998, heralding a new era in the health system of that country. Its introduction has created diverging views which are influence role implementation. This study examines social and political discourses that are affecting the development of Nurse Practitioners in Australia, using text and language to identify discursive practices. It has set out to determine whether Nurse Practitioners have the autonomy that professional nursing leaders have described in policy, or whether the introduction of the role has merely shifted nursing&#146;s sphere of influence within a traditional health care system. 

Using Fairclough&#146;s notion of power behind discourse, the language and discourses of Nurse Practitioners were explored in relation to what was happening around role development and how Nurse Practitioners positioned themselves within the environment where they worked. The use of a Critical Discourse Analysis has allowed for the various social, historical and political perspectives of nursing to be examined. Fairclough&#146;s three levels of social organisation have been used to identify the divergent discourses between the truths of implementation of the role at individual and organisational level and comparing it to that of the rhetoric of health policy. 

The discourses surrounding the creation of this advanced nursing role have been the focus of analysis. This analysis has revealed how role development is controlled by powerful groups external to the nursing profession. The dominant discourses use the traditional health care divisions of labour to maintain control through a financially driven focus on health care which does not necessarily revolve around clinical need. Further complicating the position of Nurse Practitioners is the internalisation of those dominant discourses by the nurses themselves. It reinforces Fairclough&#146;s view that the dominant power lies behind the discourse, using the system itself to maintain a status quo, rather than overtly opposing it.  

Nurse Practitioners, despite being held out by the nursing profession as clinical leaders, are not able to influence change in health care or in their own roles.  The results have further shown that nursing managers do not have an influence over the direction that health care and nursing takes. Further research is necessary to examine the broader leadership role of nursing within health care nationally and internationally, in order to establish the real position of nursing within the decision making framework of health care service development.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nurse Practitioner</field><field name="subject">Advanced nursing practice</field><field name="subject">political economy of health</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100708.110421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disability Income Insurance - The Australian Experience 1980-2001</field><field name="creator">Service, David Allen</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the experience of disability income insurance in Australia from 1980 to 2001. The data underlying the work was generously provided by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia which has collected data from the major companies which have written this business since 1976. 

The focus in this work is on the claims behaviour of those who have been insured and the implications to be drawn from the observations about that behaviour. This information is intended to be valuable to individual companies as they seek to make decisions about their pricing, underwriting and claims management so as to ensure adequate profitability of this line of business. 

The work demonstrates the following key conclusions.

There have been very radical changes in the characteristics of the business over the period and in the resulting experience. In particular, the claim termination experience has deteriorated dramatically with average claim durations now around twice that at the start of the period,

The structure of IAD8993 is no longer representative of the aggregate industry experience. This is particularly so in respect to incidence, where only one of the six characteristics included has its &#239;&#191;&#189;shape&#239;&#191;&#189; confirmed by the experience. The other five have statistically significant evidence that their &#239;&#191;&#189;shape&#239;&#191;&#189; is not consistent with the experience. For terminations three of the six are confirmed.

Many of the additional characteristics examined demonstrate that they are significant predictors of experience. In respect to incidence six of the eight examined were significant. In respect to terminations only two of the eight were significant.

There is a material element of seasonality in respect to both incidence and terminations.

While the Australian experience is materially better than the corresponding USA experience the worsening experience for medical occupations in the USA should be taken as a warning to Australia of the potential which exists in this occupation subclass.

There is a serious body of circumstantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that the experience of disability income insurance is significantly influenced by &#239;&#191;&#189;state of mind&#239;&#191;&#189; rather than &#239;&#191;&#189;state of body&#239;&#191;&#189;.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disability insurance</field><field name="subject">seasonality</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100819.143929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enlightenment was the choice: Doctor Who and the Democratisation of Science</field><field name="creator">Orthia, Lindy A</field><field name="description">The democratisation of science - shifting science governance, work opportunities and ideologies away from the exclusive domains of elite minorities and into the hands of the people - is an important aim of science communication.

In particular I analyse the social, cultural, political and economic aspects of this representation to assess its consistency with four goals for the democratisation of science: goals that I name franchise (lay empowerment in science governance), equality (equal access to opportunities in science workplaces and careers), progress (democratic choice about the role of technology in our lives and our societies) and enlightenment (democratic freedom to choose our beliefs and worldviews about the universe). 

Analysing the more than 200 'Doctor Who' serials broadcast between 1963 and 2008, I first give an overview of broad trends in the way the program has dealt with science themes and characters across four decades (1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 2000s), finding significant changes over that period. 

I then analyse in greater theoretical depth three ways that debates about the democratisation of science manifest within 'Doctor Who'. I show that the program varies in the degree to which it is consistent with the goals for the democratisation of science.

First, I investigate plotlines that depict struggles for science governance within societies and that show people trying to achieve democratic outcomes by renegotiating their relationship to science. Within that discussion I show that the literary construct of &#239;&#191;&#189;the hero&#239;&#191;&#189; can obstruct democratic outcomes in the struggles for science governance that disenfranchised characters face. In this regard, I link &#239;&#191;&#189;the hero&#239;&#191;&#189; to the social construct of &#239;&#191;&#189;the expert&#239;&#191;&#189; in real world science, which has also been critiqued as obstructive to democratisation ends.

Second, I investigate real-world public dissent to ideologies of science as they are expressed allegorically in the program. Such expressions manifest through themes that counterpose one ideological position on science (such as liberal humanism) to another ideological position (such as technorationalism) in the form of a battle between archetypal characters who embody these principles. Responding to the work of scholars who have elaborated this point, I show that such expressions of dissent to science can be twisted and undermined to serve scientistic ideals through the clever manipulation of the literary imagery that is generally associated with antiscience protest.

Third and finally, I investigate the role-modelling function of scientist and non-scientist characters in 'Doctor Who': do they role-model empowered or disempowered positions for audiences within the institution of science? In concert with the literature I show that some structural elements of fiction - including the presence of a fallible scientist hero or an ensemble cast - can contribute positively to the capacity of characters to fulfil a positive role-modelling function that encourages equality in the science workplace and open access to science for all.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Doctor Who</field><field name="subject">science communication</field><field name="subject">democratisation of science</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20100810.152632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saving soldiers the evolution of international military medical norms, 1815 to 1914</field><field name="creator">Jessica Jane Ellis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting milk protein concentration and composition of dairy cattle in the sub-tropical regions of northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">David Graham BARBER</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Analysis of Absorbing Markov Processes</field><field name="creator">Sirl, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">230100 Mathematics</field><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">780101 Mathematical sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:138877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision Theory in Conservation Biology Case Studies in Mathematical Conservation</field><field name="creator">Michael Bode</field><field name="description">Global conservation efforts are hampered by two fundamental limitations. First, there are not enough resources available to halt the destruction of vulnerable ecosystems, or to repair and manage those that have already been degraded. Second, the information required to inform effective conservation decisions is generally unavailable. Uncertainty surrounds the dynamics of the ecosystems themselves, the nature of the threatening processes, and the effects of conservation interventions. If conservation is to be effective, management plans must acknowledge and address these two fundamental limitations. All of the research in this thesis addresses one, or both of these limitations. In particular, each chapter focuses on the management of a conservation system using mathematical optimization techniques from the field of decision theory. A decision theory approach acknowledges the central role played by these limitations in the decision-making process - only by formally incorporating them can managers maximise the outcomes of the conservation system. In Chapters 3 &amp; 4, techniques are developed to efficiently share limited conservation resources between sets of high priority regions. The analyses in Chapter 3 apply existing allocation techniques to the world's 34 biodiversity hotspots, and assess whether further research into the global richness distribution of relatively unknown taxa is necessary for effective conservation, or whether existing information on well-known taxa is sufficient. Chapter 4 demonstrates how optimal control theory can provide optimal solutions to the resource allocation problem, and insight into the motivations behind the best resource allocation strategy. Chapter 5 outlines methods for optimally managing cycling predator-prey systems that experience stochastic fluctuations. This stochasticity affects the dynamics of both speCies, and their response to management interventions, in an unpredictable way. Despite this uncertainty, the application of suitable mathematical methods allows the development of efficient management strategies. Chapters 6 &amp; 7 focus on ecosystems that can be described as metapopulations. In particular, these chapters concentrate on the "connectivity" between the individual populations in such systems. Through a more accurate description of this connectivity, novel analytic methods described in Chapter 6 are able to rapidly estimate the viability of species existing in fragmented populations, and to identify patches with the highest conservation priority. Marine metapopulations are the focus of Chapter 7, in particular those of a threatened coral reef fish species. While connectivity is an important determinant of species' persistence, this process is surrounded by considerable uncertainty. The research outlined in this chapter circumvents this lack of information by identifying reef characteristics that, in the right circumstances, act as surrogates that can ensure demographically important connectivity is protected. The research reported in this thesis is applied to different conservation problems, and uses a range of mathematical techniques. Nonetheless, the objective in each chapter is to overcome the two fundamental limitations of conservation situations - resources and knowledge - by identifying and incorporating them into the decision-making process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For the boys: a qualitative study of women's gender strategies and emotional labour in professional boxing</field><field name="creator">Yvonne Lafferty</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Competitive Interactions in a Tropical Marine Epifaunal Community</field><field name="creator">Erin O'Leary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">interspecific competition, overgrowth, ascidians, sponges, bryozoans, One Tree Reef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Intercropping and Double Cropping in Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peter Michael Masasso</field><field name="description">The potential for relay intercropping and double cropping was assessed in field trials over three consecutive years at Gatton, Queensland. The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Avian patch occupancy and landscape genetics of logrunners (Orthonyx temminckii) in fragmented subtropical rainforests of South East Queensland</field><field name="creator">David Charles Pavlacky Jr.</field><field name="description">The local extinction of habitat patches and dispersal between the patches are important processes structuring animal populations in heterogeneous environments. Understanding these two processes is crucial for the conservation of wildlife populations in landscapes impacted by human land-use. Approximately 50% of the subtropical rainforest in South East Queensland, Australia has been lost to deforestation over the last 100 years. While large areas of rainforest are reserved, little is known about the distribution and population status of rainforest birds within smaller remnants in the region. The overall research problem for this thesis was to understand how deforestation and fragmentation of subtropical rainforest affects the occurrence of rainforest birds and the effective dispersal of a rainforest-restricted species, the logrunner (Orthonyx temminckii). Understanding why some bird species are lost from habitat patches while others remain will lead to improved conservation of extinction prone species in fragmented landscapes. Although the mechanisms underlying local extinctions are well established in temperate systems, the relative importance of local and regional processes on species occurrence in subtropical and tropical rainforests is poorly understood. Chapter 2 investigated the relative effects of life history and scale of habitat modification on avian site occupancy using observational data collected at 46 rainforest sites in South East Queensland. A probabilistic model for the joint site occupancy of 29 bird species was used to evaluate hypotheses for the effects of avian life history traits on the occurrence of multiple species. The single-species occurrence models incorporated habitat effects on detection, which may be especially important in rainforests because dense vegetation and idiosyncratic occurrence of species can interfere with sampling. Occupancy rates for each species were modelled to determine the relative influence of process operating at the stand, landscape and patch scales. The life history analysis indicated taxonomic Family, body mass, migratory strategy and feeding strata had large effects on avian site occupancy, whereas abundance traits such as mean density and extent of occurrence showed little predictive ability. After accounting for correlated extinction risk attributed to life history, the degradation of stand structure at the local scale was more important for species richness than habitat modification at landscape or patch scales. While individual species showed various responses to the different scales of habitat modification, the distribution of many species was limited by vegetation structure at the landscape scale. Maintaining stand basal area and restoring degraded rainforests at the local scale will increase the probability of occupancy for members of the rainforest bird community. However, revegetation and retention of forest cover at the landscape scale may be necessary for the successful colonisation of many species. Chapter 3 introduced a predictive hypothesis-driven approach for quantifying the relative contribution of historic and contemporary processes to genetic connectivity. Current analytic frameworks in population genetics have difficulty evaluating meaningful hypotheses about spatial processes in dynamic landscapes. Confronting genetic data with models of historic and contemporary landscapes allowed the identification of dispersal processes operating in naturally heterogeneous and human-altered systems. Two measures of indirect gene flow were estimated from microsatellite polymorphism among 11 logrunner populations. Of particular interest was how much information in the genetic data was attributable to processes occurring in a reconstructed historic landscape and a contemporary human-modified landscape. A linear mixed model was used to estimate appropriate sampling variance from non-independent data and information-theoretic model selection provided strength of evidence for alternate hypotheses. The historic and contemporary landscapes explained an equal proportion of variation in genetic differentiation and there was considerable evidence for a temporal shift in dispersal pattern. Migration rates estimated from genealogical information were primarily influenced by contemporary landscape change. Landscape heterogeneity appeared to facilitate gene flow prior to European settlement, but contemporary deforestation is rapidly becoming the most important barrier to logrunner dispersal. Understanding asymmetric dispersal is becoming an important consideration for the conservation metapopulations. Populations acting as net exporters of dispersing animals may be able to rescue local populations from extinction and allow metapopulations to persist in degraded landscapes impacted by habitat loss. In Chapter 4, I estimated bidirectional migration rates from genetic data to infer dispersal among 11 logrunner populations. The first question posed was, does logrunner dispersal correspond to the source-sink or balanced model of dispersal? The second question involved determining the strength of evidence for two hypotheses about how landscape structure has affected asymmetric dispersal. Hypothesis one proposed that asymmetric dispersal was primarily influenced by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Hypothesis two asserted that asymmetric dispersal was predominantly influenced by anthropogenic landscape change. The data were confronted with the alternate hypotheses using linear mixed models and landscape covariates extracted from digital maps. The results showed the direction of asymmetric dispersal was consistent with source-sink population structure. I also discovered that the asymmetry in dispersal was influenced more by anthropogenic landscape change than by naturally occurring habitat heterogeneity. Intact landscapes were net exporters of dispersing logrunners while landscapes heavily impacted by rainforest clearing were net importers of individuals. Elevated immigration rates into landscapes impacted by rainforest clearing appeared to arrest population declines in accordance with the rescue effect. The primary conclusion emerging from the study of patch occupancy and dispersal was that logrunner populations in South East Queensland conformed to a mainland-island metapopulation. Asymmetric dispersal from the largest expanse of upland rainforest appeared to prevent fragmented rainforests in close proximity from going locally extinct. While the distribution of logrunners was limited by the spatial configuration of rainforest patches, other rainforest birds exhibited variable responses to scale of habitat modification. The most consistent pattern was several species dropping-out of the community in degraded stands affected by selective timber harvest.

However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cleat mineralogy of later permian coal measures, Bowen Basin, Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Faraj, Basim Said.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0914 Resources Engineering and Extractive Metallurgy</field><field name="subject">0403 Geology</field><field name="subject">Coal mines and mining -- Queensland -- Bowen Basin.</field><field name="subject">Coal -- Geology -- Queensland -- Bowen Basin.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Stratigraphic -- Permian.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:207821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Generic resemblances?' : women and work in Queensland, 1919-1939</field><field name="creator">Scott, Joanne, 1965-</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

In addition there was an investigation into the similarities and differences in child behaviour and parenting experience, and program outcomes, for families of children with different developmental disabilities. While the Triple P Positive Parenting Program has an impressive evidence base (Sanders, 1999; Sanders, Markie-Dadds, Tully &amp; Bor, 2000) and research indicates that the standard Stepping Stones Triple P Program is efficacious for different disability groups (Roberts, Mazzucchelli, Studman &amp; Sanders, 2006) and for parents of children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (Whittingham, Sofronoff, Sheffield &amp; Sanders, 2009), to date the group version of Stepping Stones Triple P has not been comprehensively evaluated, nor the efficacy of the program evaluated when administered concurrently to parents of children with different developmental disabilities. Currently, there is a lack of participant-friendly, evidence-based group parenting programs that can be utilised in a cost-effective manner with all parents of children with disabilities. Many interventions have been designed specifically to cater to the requirements of a particular disability group. While there is some divergence in disability characteristics and in the experience of families of children with different disabilities, there is compelling evidence that many of the most challenging experiences faced by parents of disabled children (such as emotional and behavioural disturbance and delays in skill development) are shared by many disability populations (Raina et al., 2005; Bourke et al., 2008). Consequently there is empirical support for the implementation of a broad, skill-based parenting program for all parents of children with disabilities. The first study in this research project was a randomised controlled trial the Group Stepping Stones Triple P program for parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Down syndrome, other intellectual disabilities and Cerebral Palsy. Fifty-two families were included in this trial and were randomly allocated to treatment and wait-list control groups. The results demonstrate significant improvements in child behaviour and parenting difficulties that were maintained at follow-up six months later. For over a third of participants the change in child behaviour and parenting styles was clinically reliable (Jacobsen &amp; Truax, 1991; Evans, Margison &amp; Barkham, 1998). In addition, the majority of parents reported the attainment of their program goals following the intervention. The second study was a comparison of program outcomes for parents from different disability groups. The sample was divided into two groups; parents of children with ASD and parents of children with intellectual and physical disabilities. The results demonstrated significant improvements in child behaviour and parenting difficulties from pre- to post-intervention for both the ASD group and the Intellectual and Physical disability group. For a third of parents in the ASD group and over a third of parents in the Intellectual and Physical disability group, the changes were clinically reliable (Jacobsen &amp; Truax, 1991; Evans et al., 1998). In addition, the means for both groups on the child behaviour, parenting style and parental psychological functioning variables were compared. The results indicated that there were some differences in child behaviour, parenting styles and parent distress between the two groups, and in the program goals set by parents. However, overall the results revealed no systematic differences in treatment outcomes across disability groups, demonstrating that the program was effective for families of children with ASD and families of children with Intellectual and Physical disabilities. Finally, a series of three case evaluations were conducted to examine program outcomes and differences in child behaviour and parenting experiences for the families of a child with ASD, Down syndrome and Cerebral palsy. The results of the case studies revealed significant improvements in child behaviour and parenting styles for all three families, along with high levels of program satisfaction and successful attainment of parenting goals. For all three families these changes in child behaviour and parenting style were clinically reliable (Jacobsen &amp; Truax, 1991; Evans et al., 1998) and maintained at six-month follow up. The results also provided information about the similarities and differences in parenting experiences, child behaviour and program goals across the three disabilities. Overall, this research project has demonstrated that the Group Stepping Stones Triple P program is an effective parenting intervention for challenging behaviour and dysfunctional parenting in families of children with a range of developmental disabilities. The results of this research provide evidence to suggest that mixed disability group format used in the administration of the Group Stepping Stones Triple P program did not preclude positive program outcomes. Finally, the results of this research project indicate that there are many shared parenting experiencing across families of children with different disabilities and that regardless of observed differences in disability characteristics and family experiences, the Group Stepping Stones Triple P program is sufficiently flexible and comprehensive in its scope to meet the needs of families from different disability populations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stepping Stones Triple P, disability, parent training, Autistic Spectrum Disorders, Down syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Behavioural Family Intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the relationship between nutrition and infection with nematode parasites.</field><field name="creator">Bawden, R.

These specimens, previously negative for all common viral pathogens, were screened for hMPV by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on known sequences. Molecular diagnostic assays including conventional reverse transcriptase PCR assay (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR assays were subsequently developed, and molecular characterisation studies in our laboratory identified four genetic groups of hMPV. At the start of this project, little information were available regarding the virological characteristics of hMPV such as the isolation and replication kinetics of the virus in eukaryotic cells, molecular assays capable of detecting all virus subtypes, quantitation of viral load, genotyping and molecular epidemiology, correlation between virus subtypes and disease severity, and clinical spectrum of the infection. This project was designed to elucidate the virological features of hMPV that had not been explained by earlier studies on this virus. The project was limited to retrospective studies utilising the sera and nucleic acids obtained from positive subjects presenting to our hospital. The project provided relevant data in these areas, which helped in the early detection of infection and treatment, and also provided information for future research on antibody profiles and vaccine development. The study examined specific areas related to clinical and virological characteristics of hMPV with the aim of applying the results in patient management. During the project, five areas of hMPV research were undertaken, addressing each through detailed studies. An outline of the project aims and the conclusions derived from those experimental chapters is described below: 1. Isolation of the virus from clinical specimens obtained from infected subjects An optimised tissue culture protocol was successfully developed for isolating hMPV from positive nasopharyngeal aspirates, using LLC-MK2 cell lines. Viral stocks were prepared and maintained at stable conditions for future experiments. The demonstration of virus infection in the eukaryotic cells and titration of the infectious virions were performed using immunological assays developed and optimised in our laboratory, during the course of this study. 2. The complete genome sequence of an Australian hMPV isolate In this study, we described the &#8216;13,333 base pair&#8217; complete genome sequence of the Queensland hMPV type-A strain, designated as AUS-001. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genes were used to generate &#8216;topological trees&#8217; for systematic comparison of our local hMPV strain to that of international sequences. 3. A quantitative PCR assay (q.PCR) for hMPV A quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR assay (qrt.RT-PCR) was developed for the simultaneous detection and quantification of hMPV in clinical samples. Serial dilutions of a synthetic RNA control were amplified after determining the absolute RNA copy numbers, and a standard curve was derived based on the cycle thresholds (Ct) values of the respective dilutions. Quantification of the hMPV RNA in clinical specimens was performed by extrapolating this data with Ct values of specimen dilutions obtained from the real-time assay. The dynamic range of the assay for hMPV genotypes A and B was determined. Validation of the inter- and intra- assay variations was completed using negative and positive controls along with a second assay targeting a different gene. 4. Determine the molecular epidemiology of hMPV genotypes This component of the project was designed to determine the molecular epidemiology of Queensland hMPV strains, using a selected &#8216;specimen population of hMPV positives&#8217; representing the period 2001 to 2004. An RT-PCR assay based on P gene regions of hMPV was developed for the molecular typing of the above panel. Analyses of nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences confirmed the heterogeneity of hMPV strains. In our study group, two genotypes (A and B) further classified into four subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2), were found to co-circulate during this period. General epidemiological features of the hMPV infections including seasonality, co-infections, incidence and prevalence in different age groups and in general population were described. 5. Clinical characteristics of hMPV infections The aim of this analysis was to illustrate the clinical spectrum of hMPV infections in a Queensland study population. We described the hMPV incidence pattern in different age groups and investigated the clinical severity scores of hMPV genotypes based on reported clinical features. We also undertook to identify any correlations between disease severity and other factors, including genotype, co-infections and viral load. Summary On completion, this PhD study provided valuable data on the isolation, molecular detection, epidemiological pattern and clinical severity of hMPV infections in Queensland. Overall hMPV was determined to be a serious respiratory pathogen in Queensland children. Data from this thesis will contribute to improved patient management and reduce the burden of hMPV-related disease in Queensland. These studies also formed the basis of further research involving respiratory viral pathogens in our laboratory and nationally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HMPV, virus isolation, in-vitro culture, real-time RT-PCR, genome sequencing, qrt.RT-PCR, RNA standards, semi-quantification of RNA, molecular epidemiology, phylogenetic analysis, clinical characteristics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transforming Australia&#8217;s Public Employment Service: The Job Network 1998-2003</field><field name="creator">Alexandra Copley</field><field name="description">Public employment services are provided in all developed economies, justified on the basis of a public interest in efficient, effective operation of national labour markets. Although such countries adopt different approaches to delivering these services each offers what I refer to as &#8216;the three essential roles of a public employment service&#8217;. These are labour exchange services, providing job brokerage to labour market participants to enhance the efficiency of the labour market; an equity role, offering assistance to disadvantaged jobseekers to improve their prospects of employment; and a &#8216;compliance monitoring role&#8217; which contributes to maintaining the integrity of the welfare system by detecting welfare abuse. Informed by a body of research on policies and practices in the OECD I construct a model of a notional public employment service incorporating these three essential roles that I call &#8216;an OECD model&#8217;. The Job Network, an early policy reform of a newly-elected Coalition government, appeared to replicate &#8216;the OECD model&#8217;, insofar as it performed brokerage, offered equity measures and conducted invigilation of welfare compliance. However, it differed from its predecessor, the CES, in two significant respects. First it was created by the bureaucracy as a new &#8216;market&#8217; in which all employment services were purchased through a competitive tending process from private sector providers; in this, it was unique in the OECD. Second, rather than offering prescribed employment programs and services designed by public officials, private providers were free to determine the needs of clients (within broadly-defined service categories) and devise their own strategies to achieve contractually-defined &#8216;outcomes&#8217; for which they would be paid. Services were focused particularly on disadvantaged jobseekers who were expected to receive personalised assistance tailored to overcome their complex or multiple barriers to employment. The purpose of my thesis is to discover whether the Job Network (in the period from its inception to the end of the second contract) was an OECD model, by which I mean whether its three roles were conceptualised, constructed and delivered in ways that enabled them to perform the same functions as the three essential roles of the OECD model. I see this question as involving two distinct, but interrelated issues. First, I am concerned to discover whether the three roles of the Job Network share the objectives and priorities of their counterparts in the OECD model, positing that these will shape the design of services. Second, informed by a body of literature which draws attention to a range of issues emerging from privatisation of public services, I consider the impacts that private delivery had on the design and implementation of its services. iv I approach this task from a qualitative perspective to explore assumptions and priorities underpinning the political construction of the issues deemed to require policy intervention and the responses to these as reflected in the design and implementation of services, noting the effects of practices on service recipients. I argue that, together, these are the determinants of the Job Network&#8217;s policy objectives and capacities. I take as my data the political discourse, bureaucratic texts, interview materials and texts of service recipients that I have gathered to investigate, in turn, each of the three roles of the Job Network using tools and techniques from the broader field of discourse analysis, selecting those most appropriate to the nature of the data. My analysis concludes that the Job Network&#8217;s three roles do not reflect those of the OECD model, first because they are predicated on different policy objectives and second, because privatisation of service delivery affected the design of its services and the priorities of service providers in ways that undermined its capacity to perform the &#8216;essential roles&#8217;. The evidence suggests that ideological-based assumptions and preferences of a conservative government steered the Job Network towards prioritising its role in compliance monitoring, positioning it as a tool of welfare reform rather delivering interventions to enhance efficiency or equity in the labour market such as those predicated of the OECD model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">job network, public employment services, brokerage, disadvantaged jobseekers, compliance monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strain diversity of Streptococcus iniae from farmed fish</field><field name="creator">Roslina Ahmad Nawawi</field><field name="description">Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) aquaculture is expanding throughout Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. The Department of Primary Industries, Queensland have estimated that the production from this industry could reach $30 million per annum in Australia by 2010. However, current production is severely impeded by outbreaks of Streptococcus iniae, which causes a fatal septicaemia in barramundi. S. iniae is a Gram positive bacterium which infects both humans and fish and was first reported in Australia in the 1980s in Queensland, but has rapidly disseminated to other states in Australia (Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia). Globally, there appears to be little geographical restriction to the distribution of S. iniae and infection occurs in temperate, sub-tropical and tropical, marine and fresh water fish with no evidence of species specificity. Outbreaks have been reported in North America, Middle East, Europe and Asia-Pacific, including Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, China, Taiwan and Japan. Understanding distribution and spread of S. iniae is confounded by a number of factors. Firstly, identification of S. iniae is not straightforward, thus isolates often remain &#8216;unidentified&#8217;, as this bacterium is not included in commercial databases. In other cases it is misidentified as other bacteria such as S.uberis, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis and S. anginosus. Furthermore, variability in phenotypic traits has led to difficulty in identifying isolates using standard commercial diagnostic kits. Additionally, there is tangible evidence of geographic diversity and endemism with strain variability having been reported from fish isolates in Japan, USA and Israel, and in human isolates from Canada, USA and SE Asia. Understanding strain diversity amongst S. iniae is critically important in terms of managing the disease. Ability to track routes of distribution of the pathogen in imported fish, including ornamentals and food fish has implications for better biosecurity. Perhaps most importantly, strain diversity has been reported as a cause of vaccine failure in trout in Israel and in barramundi in Northern Territory, Australia. To date, very little information exists on strain diversity in S. iniae and no research has been conducted on the diversity amongst Australian isolates within the barramundi industry. The aim of this thesis is to develop reliable methods for identification of differing strains of S. iniae and to investigate antigenic diversity in order to better inform both vaccine design and biosecurity procedures with which to manage this important disease in Australia and globally. To achieve this, a collection of more than 100 isolates from Australia and throughout the world has been created and stored at the University of Queensland. In the first chapter of my thesis, routine confirmatory diagnosis using amplification of the lactate oxidase gene was performed to support biochemical and physiological identification provided by the supplying laboratories and veterinarians. During this initial screen, two important discoveries were made. Firstly, S. iniae isolates can be divided into two groups based on the different sizes of PCR product obtained, 869 bp (now named Type 1) and 921 bp (now named Type 2). This difference was only found in isolates from Northern Territory, Australia. In light of this, identity was further confirmed by the results of partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene with the 530F primer and submission to the BLAST server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST), which returned identities of 100% to S. iniae ATCC 29178. Sequence analysis of the lctO gene in isolates representing both the normal (lctO type 1) and higher molecular weight (lctO type 2) revealed that there is an insertion of 51 bp of repeat sequence in lctO type 2. Apart from the insertion sequence found in the 3' end of the gene in some isolates, three nucleotides in positions 211-213, not previously detected when the gene was described previously, resulted in an inserted valine residue in the translated product from all isolates. I also note an apparent error in the primary sequence and translation of the GenBank sequence (Y07622). This is likely to be due to an inserted C nucleotide at position 1148 at the far 3&#8217; end of the gene sequence (inside the LOX-1, LOX-2 priming region) that has altered the reading frame. This means that the expected PCR product size of 870 bp is incorrect and is actually 869 bp. To determine the phenotypic relevance of the variation in lox gene product size, the lactate oxidase enzyme was extracted from cell lysates and assayed for activity. The two variant genes were each cloned and expressed in E. coli. Lactate oxidase enzyme activity also showed that there were differences in enzyme activity between the two gene products with strains expressing the higher molecular weight enzyme variant exhibiting higher enzyme activity. This suggests that positive selection may apply in favour of the larger gene in situations where lactate is the most readily available carbon source. However, no variation was detected in the lactate permease gene lctP, for any of the strains analysed. Whilst there was no difference in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Test (MIC) using different concentration of lactate there were differences detected in the growth rate of QMA0165 and QMA0177. Significant inhibition on growth rate of QMA0165 was detected with a 0.3% and 0.5% of lactate while there was no significant inhibition in QMA0177 with the same concentration. Prediction on three dimensional protein structure using PyMol based on Aerococcus viridans 3-D protein structure showed that there was an additional loop in lctO type 2 which suggested that it might play a role in enhancing enzyme activity of the binding site. The environment in barramundi farms in Northern Territory where the lctO type 2 isolates were isolated has 9 metre tides resulting in water flows in excess of 3km/h. It is likely that the resulting enforced swimming of the fish host has led to selection and maintenance of a gene encoding the higher efficiency enzyme in S. iniae. As diversity has led to reported vaccine failure in Israel, and antigenic diversity has been recorded in Japan and in isolates from the USA, the second data chapter of this thesis explores surface antigenic diversity of Australian S. iniae isolates from barramundi using a whole cell ELISA using a suite of antibodies raised in barramundi against four S. inaie isolates from differing habitats (freshwater and marine) and states (Western Australia and Queensland) in Australia. Forty-one isolates predominantly from farmed fish throughout Australia between 1995 and 2006 were serotyped and compared with reference isolates from the USA and Canada. Multiple serotypes were identified using polyclonal sera raised in barramundi against four different Australian S. iniae isolates i.e. anti QMA0072 (Queensland), anti QMA0074 (Queensland), anti QMA0083 (Western Australia) and anti QMA0087 (Western Australia). Different serotypes were often isolated from the same sites either simultaneously or within short time periods, indicating potential coexistence of multiple isolates in a particular geographic location or habitat. Electrophoretic profiles of whole cell proteins and integral membrane proteins were similar amongst isolates when analysed by SDS- PAGE, regardless of serotype. The results presented here suggest that surface serotypic variability of S. iniae is complex and multifactorial involving capsular carbohydrate and some surface proteins. As raising consistent antiserum in barramundi is almost impossible, and rabbit antisera invariably recognise more epitopes than teleost fish, a more consistent molecular method of typing was investigated in the third data chapter. In this chapter, the whole genome of S. iniae was digested using SmaI and separated using Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Twenty four isolates representing different geographical origin and host were analysed using this method. Reference isolates from dolphins, fish and humans were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control for comparison. PFGE profiles indicated at least 4 distinct groups amongst the Australian isolates, but these did not correlate with surface serotype. Interestingly, whilst there have been no reports of human cases of S. iniae infection in Australia, many of the isolates examined had closely related PFGE profile with reference human isolates from USA and Canada, but were markedly different from the type isolates isolated from dolphins. One of the major difficulties associated with PFGE is between lab variability, hence the requirement for inclusion of large numbers of reference isolates on each gel. Recently, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been developed for epidemiological studies in a variety of human pathogens. MLST is based on sequencing of 8 ubiquitous housekeeping genes, genes which evolve slowly, allowing clustering of isolates. As sequencing is consistent between laboratories, results can be posted on a website and compared internationally without requiring transfer of strains overseas. The fourth data chapter in my thesis develops for the first time an MLST scheme for S. iniae. Primers for eight housekeeping genes were designed and annealing temperature for amplification were optimized. The selected housekeeping genes were: adhP (Alcohol dehydrogenase), pheS (Phenylalanyl tRNA syhthetase), atr (Amino acid transporter), glnA (Glutamine synthetase), sdhA (Serine dehydrogenase), glcK (Glucose kinase) and tkt (Transketolase). However, glnA was dropped from the analysis because of the inconsistent PCR product. Thirty seven isolates were selected representing the Australian isolates and other international isolates from United States, Canada, Israel, Thailand, Reunion Island with different hosts i.e. Amazon freshwater dolphin, human, flying fox and different species of fish (Channa striata, Oncorhynchus mykiss and Lates calcarifer). As there is no database available for S. iniae in the MLST database yet, only limited isolates from the global collection that can be analysed with the Australian isolates. The present study found that MLST results are less discriminative when compared to PFGE, but were very useful in pinpointing origin to a particular country, perhaps indicating little transfer of isolates between nations. MLST grouped together Australian, Thailand (QMA0187 and QMA0190), human isolates from Canada and USA regardless the geographic origin (QMA0130, QMA0133 and QMA0137) and also fish isolate from Canada (QMA0139). The similarity of the human isolates with the Australian isolates supporting PFGE results, which had a similar SmaI PFGE profiles to many of the fish isolates from Australia. However, MLST managed to distinguish isolates QMA0140 (dolphin/ USA), QMA0141 (dolphin/ USA), QMA0136 (human/ USA) and other international isolates from Israel (QMA0186 and QMA0188), Reunion Island (QMA0189). Despite the degree of heterogeneity in other methods used (serotyping, PFGE), MLST method showed a high homogeneity amongst S. iniae from Australia, perhaps reflecting the slow evolution of these genes and no accidental import of isolates. During the 12 years of isolates covered by our strain collection, there would appear to have been no evolution of these highly conserved genes within Australia. The variation in serotype within a single Sequence Type showed that there may be frequent horizontal gene transfer, or more rapid evolution of genes involved in synthesis and transport of capsular polysaccharide or other surface features. Moreover, the PFGE results indicate that there is more genetic plasticity in amongst the genome of S. iniae than indicated by then MLST. In order to gain a more discriminative epidemiological perspective of S. iniae, the results presented in this thesis suggest combination of different typing methods such as PFGE and MLST, with the latter providing an accurate means of determining nation of origin of strains (and therefore of great potential for biosecurity purposes) whilst PFGE may provide better discrimination of movement of local isolates within Australia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streptococcus iniae</field><field name="subject">barramundi</field><field name="subject">strain diversity</field><field name="subject">lactate oxidase gene (lctO)</field><field name="subject">multiple serotypes</field><field name="subject">genetic variability</field><field name="subject">sequence type (ST)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:209957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steady viscous axisymmetric flows associated with rotating disks.</field><field name="creator">Rasmussen, Henning.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics.</field><field name="subject">Rotating masses of fluid.</field><field name="subject">Boundary value problems.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass transfer and coalescence in agitated liquid-liquid dispersions</field><field name="creator">Howarth, W.

Additionally the psychometric properties of the Parent Problem Checklist (PPC; Dadds &amp; Powell, 1991) were examined in sample of 200 parents sharing the role of parenting. The purpose of the present study was threefold: (1) to gain a measure of parenting conflict and children&#8217;s behavioural and emotional problems in a non-clinic referred community sample, (2) to examine the individual contribution of conflict specific to child-rearing to the prediction of child problems, and (3) to further validate the psychometric properties and examine the factor structure of the Parent Problem Checklist (PPC; Dadds &amp; Powell, 1991). Findings support the hypothesis that parenting conflict influences children&#8217;s outcomes more than either general marital conflict or marital satisfaction. Analyses of the PPC show evidence of strong reliability and validity for the measure and factor analysis provided support for a two-factor structure. Implications for clinical practice and understanding the role of parenting conflict in the development of child difficulty are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parenting</field><field name="subject">inter-parental conflict</field><field name="subject">parent problem checklist</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:139088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using scenario planning to identify potential impacts of socio-demographic change on aspects of domestic tourism demand in Queensland in 2021</field><field name="creator">Glover, Petra Sabine</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tourism -- Supply and demand -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Forecasting</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Queensland -- Economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Promising lives: First placegetters in the Queensland Scholarship examination 1873-1962</field><field name="creator">Mackenzie, Marion Elizabeth</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Examinations -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Biography.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An historical assessment of economic development, manufacturing and the political economy in Queensland, 1900 to 1930</field><field name="creator">Cameron, David Bruce</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

It is written within a framework of the ethnography of speaking, and specifically relates what people say (language form), to its effect on people (language function), examining aspects of context. This ethnographically based language study goes beyond formal details of grammatical structure, presents new data on the Aboriginal use of English, and explores some areas where the conventional grammatical analysis of Standard English does not adequately account for differences between Aboriginal and White Australian uses of English. It also provides evidence which shows that Aboriginal ways of speaking persist in a region where traditional Aboriginal languages are rarely used. The first chapter introduces the study, giving background to the research and motivating the central questions addressed in the thesis. The second chapter provides the theoretical orientation of the thesis, asks its central questions and, after reviewing the ethnography of speaking literature, provides a framework to answer them. The third chapter reviews literature on Australian Aboriginal languages from a sociolinguistic perspective. The fourth chapter provides background information about SEQAB society. The following three chapters treat the SEQAB use of English, each chapter focusing on a specific function of language: the fifth chapter focuses on seeking information, the sixth chapter on giving and seeking reasons for actions, and the seventh chapter on talking about future action. The final chapter concludes that while linguistic forms used by SEQAB speakers of English are mostly shared with White Australian speakers of English, there are crucial differences in meaning which can be understood only in terms of the SEQAB socio-cultural context, including customary intentions of speakers and interpretations of hearers. Considering the data and analysis presented in this thesis, I assert that SEQAB people today use English as an Aboriginal language.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420101 English</field><field name="subject">English language -- Australia</field><field name="subject">English language -- Dialects -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role relationships and role perceptions of police officers</field><field name="creator">Christie, Gayre</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">390400 Law Enforcement</field><field name="subject">Queensland.

on Brown and Levinson&#8217;s negative politeness strategies and Mona Baker&#8217;s translation strategies to analyze how the translators of the Chinese novel, Honglou meng, employ these strategies to render honorifics and self-deprecatory expressions in Honglou meng from Chinese into English. It compares the two English translations and observes the translators&#8217; tendencies in both translations. The findings suggest that David Hawkes&#8217; translation is esthetically crafted language and more target-oriented, whereas Yang Hsien-yi and Glays Yang&#8217;s translation is not such natural-sounding English and more source-oriented.

The primary focus of the study is the progress of the first generation of settlement, 1861-1880. Presented in generally chronological form, the experimental successes and failures of the first white inhabitants of Australia's first enduring tropical settlement are examined. The emphasis is social, but issues of regional frontier economics, immigration from Europe and other Australian colonies, patterns of settlement in the district, political development featuring the first North Queensland separation movement, race relations during initial contact between the whites and Aborigines and sea and overland communications are integral components. For administrative purposes, the Queensland Government sub-divided the Kennedy into two regions, north and south, and it was the south Kennedy with which*Bowen most interacted. Bowen was the first of several coastal frontier towns in the North Queensland area. Its early ambition was to become the capital of a new North Queensland colony, but rivalries for prominence in the region soon arose. Eventually, the centre of Townsville, to Bowen's north, overshadowed the first settlement, and by 1880, the future of Bowen as a permanent but secondary port was determined.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bowen (Qld.) -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dumping ground : Barambah Aboriginal settlement 1900-40</field><field name="creator">Blake, Thom W.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210301 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander History</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Reservations.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Government relations.</field><field name="subject">Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve (Qld.)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arnold Wienholt, man and myth: A biography</field><field name="creator">Siemon, Rosamond</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Wienholt, Arnold, 1877-1940</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Queensland Baptists: The development of Baptist evangelicalism, 1846-1926</field><field name="creator">O'Leary, Patrick John</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220401 Christian Studies (incl.

R.</field><field name="description">This study has been uaidertaken essentially as a contribution to social history, to the exploration of facets of the Catholic sub-population in Queensland over the years 1910 to 1935. It is not an ecclesiastical history, nor a political or economic one, though considerations of prior concern for each such history impinge centrally on its subject matter. It will be argued that around both the years 1910 and 1935 new kinds of consciousness were emerging, both v/ithin the Church in Queensland and in its wider environment. This interval has been seen, therefore, as a unit permitting of a degree of discrete study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">750401 Religion and society</field><field name="subject">Catholic church -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Catholics -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamentalism and conservative protestantism in Australia, 1920-1980</field><field name="creator">Parker, David</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fundamentalism</field><field name="subject">Protestant churches -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Church history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jondaryan Station : the relationship between pastoral capital and pastoral labour, 1840-1890</field><field name="creator">Walker, Janette A.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural laborers -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Rural conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The economics of developing a long-distance walking track in North Queensand</field><field name="creator">Cook, Averil</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1506 Tourism</field><field name="subject">Trails -- Economic aspects -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="subject">Tourism -- Economic aspects -- Queensland, Northern.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The establishment of the University of Queensland</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Eddie</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Queensland -- History</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A history of the beef cattle industry in the Fitzroy region of Central Queensland, 1850s-1970s</field><field name="creator">McDonald, Lorna</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630501 Livestock</field><field name="subject">Beef industry -- Queensland -- Fitzroy Region -- History</field><field name="subject">Beef cattle industry: Central Queensland 1850s-1970s</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">John Moffat of Irvinebank : a biography of a regional entrepreneur</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Ruth S.

practitioners involved in areas outside of their training: specifically, with the way designers embrace a do-it-yourself or DIY ethic to create experimental, ephemeral, collaborative environments not usually considered &#8220;architecture&#8221; in the professional sense. This happens because they become directly involved with a variety of methods, construction activities, project types and materials normally associated with amateur building. The thesis does not aim to contribute to more comprehensive solutions for architectural production (say, commercial practice), but rather focuses on a particular production opportunity. It attempts to draw forth qualities of process, practice and conceptualisation that are of relevance to architecture and could be the basis of future exploration in architecture.

Upon arrival in a resettlement country, refugees face many challenges in adjusting to their new environment (Simich et al., 2006; Valtonen, 1998). Arab Muslim refugees have specific concerns that are different to other refugee groups due to the major role Islam plays in the way Muslim people go about their lives, and due to the controversial image of Muslims in Western countries since the September 11th (USA) and July 7th (London) bombings. To date, relatively little attention has been paid to the various ongoing resettlement issues that these refugees deal with. This research attempts to fill in some of these gaps by addressing the resettlement experiences of Arab Muslim refugees in New Zealand. It is expected that this research will assist the policy making and migrant services sector (a) to understand the refugees' lived realities; (b) to confront the stereotypes associated with refugees in general, and the stereotypes associated with Arab Muslim refugees in particular; and (c) to address the issues and challenges faced by Arab Muslim refugees. The significance of this research is located in its potential to influence policy and practice in the fields of refugee resettlement, immigration, and counselling. In addition, this study will contribute to knowledge about Arab Muslim refugees, especially those living in New Zealand. Recently, studies in the fields of sociology, anthropology, and psychology on refugees and refugee resettlement have found that non-Western refugees experience a variety of resettlement and adjustment challenges when settling in Western societies. However, intensive research is needed on refugees' perspectives on their refugee journey, their resilience during resettlement, and the experiences that accompany the refugee journey. A deepened understanding of the phenomenon of the refugee journey may contribute to the development of appropriate support for refugees and foster welcoming host societies. It is therefore anticipated that this study of the refugee experiences of Arab Muslims will add to existing research on refugee resettlement and in particular Arab Muslim refugees in Western societies. Semi-structured, face to face interviews were conducted with 31 male and female Arabic-speaking Muslim refugees from Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Kuwait, and Tunisia. The participants had been "resettled" in New Zealand for at least six months and up to eleven years. Most of the interviews were conducted in Arabic and then translated to English. The interviews were analysed using an eclectic approach including thematic analysis with elements of life story narratives. The findings that emerged from this research suggest that whatever the national and ethnic background of the refugee, there are common key issues and themes relating to the refugee journey and the challenges experienced by refugees during their resettlement. The interviews revealed participants' experiences of their lives as refugees, which were described in three separate stages that I have termed the "three legs of the refugee journey." The first leg of the refugee journey included the refugees' pre-migration experience: reasons for fleeing their homelands, becoming a refugee, and the impact of the refugee label on their lives in their resettlement country. The second leg of the refugee journey involved their experiences in adjusting to their 'new' lives after leaving Mangere Refugee Resettlement Centre (MRRC): their experiences with several resettlement agencies in NZ, their unforeseen resettlement challenges such as language barriers, unemployment, and their concern over raising their children in a non-Muslim society. The third leg uncovered the experiences participants went through after one year of their initial resettlement, and also explored methods of coping and resilience that participants used to overcome their ongoing resettlement challenges and mental health concerns, and their perspective on New Zealand as a resettlement country. This leg also included the participants' future aspirations and their long-term resettlement plans. Overall, participants were unprepared for the situation that faced them when they arrived in New Zealand. Their experience in the six weeks at the resettlement centre was disappointing for all of them and traumatic for some. Participants did not feel that they were equipped with "survival skills" for dealing with life outside the centre. All participants expressed that they had difficulties adjusting to their new life in New Zealand. In general, women found adjustment more difficult than men. Some participants expressed gratitude to New Zealand for accepting them as refugees. A minority were happy to remain in New Zealand, the majority were reluctant about staying, and a small number intended to return to their homeland or other Arab Muslim countries as soon as they could. It is significant that for the participants in this study, their identity as a refugee had an overwhelming impact on the way they talked about their lives. Participants had the perception that being labelled as refugees was a factor that alienated them from New Zealand society. Also, being Arab and Muslim as well as a refugee was seen as an additional disadvantage for resettlement opportunities in New Zealand and other Western countries. While Arab Muslim refugees share many of the concerns of other refugees, there are particular issues, including the challenge of maintaining their religious and cultural traditions, which they experienced as being in conflict with resettling in a Western country. Despite the fact that New Zealand has a long history in assisting in the resettlement of refugees, this research reinforces previous research in New Zealand which points to the inadequacies of the resettlement experience for refugees during all three legs of the refugee journey. The thesis therefore concludes with recommendations for improving refugee policies and services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arab</field><field name="subject">Muslim</field><field name="subject">Refugee</field><field name="subject">Resettlement Services</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a new measure of work-ability for injured workers</field><field name="creator">Fadyl, Joanna K.</field><field name="description">Background: Work-ability is often assessed as part of the vocational rehabilitation process for injured workers.  However, research highlights a concern among therapists who carry out vocational assessments that there is a lack of consistency with regard to quality and comprehensiveness using current methods of assessment.  One of the reasons for this is that there are no standardized measures of work-ability available that are designed to be used for the purpose of facilitating rehabilitation.  The Participation And Work-ability Support Scale (PAWSS) is a new measure, conceptualized and initially developed by Professors Lynne Turner-Stokes and Kathryn McPherson, that was designed to address this gap. Design and Methods: This research was designed to develop the PAWSS measure to the point where it had face validity, and was complete enough to be formally psychometrically tested.  The design of the research involved three parts.  Firstly, a comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken.  This was done to identify all the aspects of work functioning that are considered to contribute to work-ability, and then consider currently available work-ability measures in relation to their suitability for assessing vocational support needs.  Secondly, in phase one of the research, qualitative focus groups and interviews with stakeholders in the return-to-work process were undertaken.  The purpose of this phase was to check the content of the measure against stakeholder experiences, and determine the most appropriate administration context and procedures.  Interviews and focus groups were analysed using descriptive analysis, and findings were used to inform revisions to the measure.  Finally, phase two of the research involved pilot testing the measure.  This was carried out by contracting experienced occupational therapists to test the new measure with consenting workplace assessment clients.  Feedback from assessors and injured workers, assessor testing notes and scoring were analysed to examine feasibility and acceptability of the PAWSS, and revisions to the measure were made in accordance with findings.Results: The qualitative interviews and focus groups (phase one) provided feedback and comments that informed adaptations to the measure to bring it more in line with stakeholders&#8217; experiences of work-ability.  Furthermore, this phase provided information about the context in which the measure should be administered, and this was adopted for the pilot testing.  Pilot testing of the measure (phase two) showed that the measure was acceptable to both the assessors and the injured workers, and that it was feasible to administer as part of a workplace assessment.  Revisions to the measure and training procedures at this stage were primarily made to enhance clarity of item descriptions and scoring decisions. Conclusions and implications for practice: Findings from the research confirmed the need for a standardized measure of work-ability that can be used to plan vocational supports and interventions.  Furthermore, the PAWSS was shown to be feasible and acceptable as a comprehensive tool for assessment of the work-ability of injured workers.  Further research is needed to test the reliability and validity of the PAWSS before it can be used in practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Measure development</field><field name="subject">Work injuries</field><field name="subject">Work disability</field><field name="subject">Work incapacity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When too much sun is never enough: Association of the VDR gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance</field><field name="creator">Jain, Reema</field><field name="description">The metabolism of vitamin D commences with exposure of the skin to sunlight. The growing recognition of its role in insulin resistance, autoimmune disorders, infections, cancer, as well as the health of cells that influence physical and mental function have profound implications on how we define vitamin D requirements and why we should care whether they are met or not. Most of the actions of vitamin D are mediated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a protein whose gene sequence can vary, giving rise to polymorphic forms which are potent enough to affect the binding capacity of this protein to vitamin D. Some of these polymorphic forms of VDR gene may be associated with reduced effectiveness of vitamin D and hence predispose individuals to diseases such as type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. An earlier study, the Surya Study, looked at the responsiveness of the South-Asian women living in Auckland to vitamin D. The research described here is an extension of this study and its focus was to identify the associations/linkages between certain polymorphic forms of the VDR gene and the disease conditions and intervention responsiveness in the same women. The first objective was to compare two well known techniques for genotyping single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the VDR gene at the 3&#8217; end, namely BsmI, ApaI and TaqI: the newer real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and the traditional restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR) techniques. This comparison was performed to evaluate alternative methods for genotyping which consumed less time than RFLP-PCR. When the presence of each polymorphism by both the techniques was compared in this cohort of South-Asian women, it was found that RFLP-PCR proved to be a more reliable technique than qPCR for genotyping the VDR gene. Another objective of this project was to investigate the prevalence of the above three polymorphisms along with Cdx-2 and FokI SNPs which are present at the 5&#8217; end of the VDR gene, in the population under study and their possible association with phenotypes such as vitamin D responsiveness and insulin resistance. These women were screened and biochemical data was collected during the earlier Surya Study. Of these, eighty-one women were then selected for intervention based on them having high insulin resistance (HOMA-IR&gt;1.93) and serum 25(OH)D&lt;50 nmol/L. Out of these eighty-one women, forty-two were given vitamin D supplement and thirty-nine were given a placebo for six months. Baseline and endpoint measurements included insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S) etc. How each individual responded to treatment in the intervention group was analysed in the context of the polymorphisms that they had. An association of insulin resistance with BsmI, ApaI and TaqI SNPs was observed in this cohort of 239 women. The response to insulin resistance in the vitamin D supplemented group significantly differed for FokI genotype compared to other genotypes. This explained why certain women responded to treatment better than the others. When the frequencies of the genotypes of these five SNPs of the VDR gene were compared to other studies of different ethnicities, the results of this study were consistent with few studies but contradictory to others. The possible reasons for these differences could be because of small sample size and different ethnicities under study due to which the frequency of alleles and hence the genotypes differed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vitamin D receptor</field><field name="subject">polymorphisms</field><field name="subject">haplotype</field><field name="subject">association</field><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">RFLP-PCR</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When too much sun is never enough: Association of the VDR gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance</field><field name="creator">Jain, Reema</field><field name="description">The metabolism of vitamin D commences with exposure of the skin to sunlight.

Under this Act, local authorities were required to consult with their communities to develop long term plans identifying social, economic, environmental and cultural outcomes and progress indicators within a sustainable development framework. Since 2002, local authorities have developed at least one long term plan with a full consultation process. This thesis explored the interpretation of cultural wellbeing based on ethnicity and cultural identity, identifying factors that may influence indicator development using Hamilton City Council&#8217;s Long Term Council Community Plan (LTCCP) 2006 as a case study. The qualitative and secondary quantitative research has shown tensions exist, between the application of a western definition of cultural wellbeing and the cultural worldview within a governance model. Subsequent findings relate to the dearth of literature exploring the relationship between principles of citizenship, cultural diversity and cultural wellbeing within a New Zealand setting. Through the reflexive research process it has been identified that any further work in this area draws on community participatory research design and indigenous methodology. Cultural wellbeing is a live process moving beyond the manifestation of tradition and custom that traditionally has been associated with indicator development. The generic nature of cultural wellbeing indicators could be related to the need for more research into the epistemology of culture as a knowledge tradition in itself and how it is incorporated into development of wellbeing measures and indicators. By drawing on central, local and regional monitoring programmes, local authorities, such as Hamilton City Council have demonstrated an evolution in the type of cultural wellbeing indicators and outcomes used; however the full intent of broadening the role of local government to include cultural wellbeing is still to be realised.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural well-being</field><field name="subject">Local Government Act 2002</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building maintenance in the sports and leisure facilities, Hong Kong</field><field name="creator">Hackman, Lee Hon Yin</field><field name="description">The aims of this study are to identify patterns and similarities related to the four areas in the building maintenance operation processes by using multiple cases qualitative approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buildings</field><field name="subject">Sports facilities</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/48317</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:35509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body politics : a Foucauldian discourse analysis of physiotherapy practice</field><field name="creator">Nicholls, David A</field><field name="description">This thesis offers new insights into physiotherapy practice by asking 'how is physiotherapy discursively constructed?'

At the same time, universities were increasingly using online technologies for teaching and learning. Little is known about how these two significant changes in teaching and learning might be acting and interacting at a time of increasing focus by universities on the educational marketplace. This thesis investigates the AUQA audits carried out in 2002 of three Australian universities which had different locations in the Australian higher education marketplace and had different approaches to the use of online technologies. I use Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to analyse a range of artefacts produced between 2002 and 2005 by and about the universities. I analyse the first three editions of the AUQA manual, the universities' web sites before and after their audit, the submissions of those universities to AUQA, and the audit reports by AUQA on them. I explore the role that representations of the "online university" discourse play in constructions of a "quality university" discourse within these texts. I discovered a number of shifts in emphasis in the texts over time. Notions of the "online university", while prevalent in the texts produced early in the time frame of the study, were absent from later texts. Also, texts produced early in the study represented the three universities as very different institutions. However texts examined towards the end of the study represented the universities to be more similar in nature. Given the diverse nature of the institutions' market locations, I found that quality assurance processes work to reduce the representation of institutional diversity. There was evidence that the "online university" discourse came to be used more as a marketing tool and less as a marker of quality education over the time period of the study. I argue that AUQA's audits do not support institutions? various market positionings as described by Marginson and Considine (2000), but rather provide the imprimatur of "brand Australia" by producing representations of each institution that are safe and amenable to the audit process. The "online university" discourse speaks of new and borderless teaching strategies, while the "quality university" discourse speaks of containment and control of university activities. The bounding and limiting effect of the "quality university" discourse over the outward reaching "online university" discourse resulted in the three universities representing themselves in increasingly isomorphic ways. My analysis shows that over the time frame of the study, the surveillance of a national quality audit body, through self-audit by universities and the subsequent publication of reviews of universities by that body, produced more cautious representations of the universities and ironically, less direct influence by the audit body over universities? actions in the marketplace. The study suggests that the degree of influence which the ?online university? discourse and the "quality university" discourse have on the representations of universities is dependent largely on the degree to which they can impel universities within the market.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cultural Policy Studies</field><field name="subject">Higher Education</field><field name="subject">Quality Assurance</field><field name="subject">Online Education</field><field name="subject">Critical Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Education and Extension</field><field name="subject">Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">Educational Technology and Media</field><field name="subject">Other Education</field><field name="subject">Political Economy</field><field name="subject">Quality Management</field><field name="subject">Public Policy</field><field name="subject">Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">Discourse and Pragmatics</field><field name="subject">Language in Culture and Society (Sociolinguistics)</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/43053</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:31155</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of population lifetime data of South Australia 1841 - 1996</field><field name="creator">Leppard, Phillip I.</field><field name="description">The average length of life from birth until death in a human population is a single statistic that is often used to characterise the prevailing health status of the population. It is one of many statistics calculated from an analysis that, for each age, combines the number of deaths with the size of the population in which these deaths occur. This analysis is generally known as life table analysis. Life tables have only occasionally been produced specifically for South Australia, although the necessary data has been routinely collected since 1842. In this thesis, the mortality pattern of South Australia over the period of 150 years of European settlement is quantified by using life table analyses and estimates of average length of life. In Chapter 1, a mathematical derivation is given for the lifetime statistical distribution function that is the basis of life table analysis, and from which the average length of life or current expected life is calculated. This derivation uses mathematical notation that clearly shows the deficiency of current expected life as a measure of the life expectancy of an existing population. Four statistical estimation procedures are defined, and the computationally intensive method of bootstrapping is discussed as an estimation procedure for the standard error of each of the estimates of expected life. A generalisation of this method is given to examine the robustness of the estimate of current expected life. In Chapter 2, gender and age-specific mortality and population data are presented for twenty five three-year periods; each period encompassing one of the colonial (1841-1901) or post-Federation (1911-96) censuses that have been taken in South Australia. For both genders within a census period, four types of estimate of current expected life, each with a bootstrap standard error, are calculated and compared, and a robustness assessment is made. In Chapter 3, an alternate measure of life expectancy known as generation expected life is considered. Generation expected life is derived by extracting, from official records arranged in temporal order, the mortality pattern of a notional group of individuals who were born in the same calendar year. Several estimates of generation expected life are calculated using South Australian data, and each estimate is compared to the corresponding estimate of current expected life. Additional estimates of generation expected life calculated using data obtained from the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial quantify the reduction in male generation expected life for 1881-1900 as a consequence of military service during World War I, 1914-18, and the Influenza Pandemic, 1919.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Australia 1841-1996, current expected life, generation expected life, bootstrap errors of the estimates</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random allocations: new and extended models and techniques with applications and numerics.</field><field name="creator">Kennington, Raymond William</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a general methodology for classifying and describing many combinatoric problems, systematising and finding theoretical expressions for quantities of interest, and investigating their feasible numerical evaluation. Unifying notation and definitions are provided. Our knowledge of random allocations is also extended. This is achieved by investigating new processes, generalising known processes, and by providing a formal structure and innovative techniques for analysing them. The random allocation models described in this thesis can be classified as occupancy urn models, in which we have a sequence of urns and throw balls into them, and investigate static, waiting-time and dynamic processes. Various structures are placed on the relationship(s) between cells, balls, and the selection of items being distributed, including varieties, batch arrivals, taboo sets and blocking sets. Static, waiting-time and dynamic processes are investigated. Both without-replacement and with-replacement sampling types are considered. Emphasis is placed on the distributions of waiting-times for one or more events to occur measured from the time a particular event occurs; this begins as an abstraction and generalisation of a model of departures of cars parked in lanes. One of several additional determinations is the platoon size distribution. Models are analysed using combinatorial analysis and Markov Chains. Global attributes are measured, including maximum waits, maximum room required, moments and the clustering of completions. Various conversion formulae have been devised to reduce calculation times by several orders of magnitude. New and extended applications include Queueing in Lanes, Cake Displays, Coupon Collector's Problem, Sock-Sorting, Matching Dependent Sets (including Genetic Code Attribute Matching and the game SET), the Zig-Zag Problem, Testing for Randomness (including the Cake Display Test, which is a without-replacement test similar to the standard Empty Cell test), Waiting for Luggage at an Airport, Breakdowns in a Network, Learning Theory and Estimating the Number of Skeletons at an Archaeological Dig. Fundamental, reduction and covering theorems provide ways to reduce the number of calculations required. New combinatorial identities are discovered and a well-known one is proved in a combinatorial way for the first time. Some known results are derived from simple cases of the general models.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">random allocations; occupancy urn models, static models; dynamic models; waiting-time models; without-replacement; with-replacement; Psi-processes; probability theory; P. of I.E. for the mini-max; Bonderroni's inequalities; asymptotic distributions; the game SET; coupon-collector's problem; cake display problem; zig-zag problem</field><field name="subject">Combinatorial probabilities.</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultraviolet disinfection kinetics for potable water production.</field><field name="creator">Amos, Steve A.</field><field name="description">Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light is used for the disinfection of bacterial contaminants in the production of potable water, and in the treatment of selected wastewaters. However, efficacy of UV disinfection is limited by the combined effect of suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance. Limited published UV disinfection data are available that account for the combined effects of UV dose, suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance. This present lack of a rigorous quantitative understanding of the kinetics of UV disinfection limits process optimisation and wider application of UV treatment. The development and validation of an adequate model to describe UV disinfection kinetics presented in this thesis can therefore be justified by an increased confidence of reliability of design for UV disinfection. Using the published data of Nguyen (1999), four established model forms were assessed to account for the combined effect of suspended solids and/or soluble UV absorbing compounds, and UV dose on the efficacy of disinfection. The four model forms were: a log-linear form, Davey Linear-Arrhenius (DL-A), Square-Root (or Ratkowsky- Belehradek) and a general nth order Polynomial (nOP) form that was limited to a third order. Criteria for assessment of an adequate predictive model were established including: accuracy of predicted against observed values, percent variance accounted for (%V), and; appraisal of residuals. The DL-A model was shown to best fit the data for UV disinfection of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); followed by the nOP, log-linear and Square-Root forms. However, the DL-A form must be used in conjunction with a first-order chemical reaction equation, and was shown to predict poorly at high experimental values of UV dose (&gt; 40,000 &#956;Ws cm-2). The DL-A model was not amenable to extrapolation beyond the observed UV dose range. To overcome the shortcomings of the Davey Linear-Arrhenius model synthesis of two new, non-linear model forms was undertaken. The two models were a modified exponentially damped polynomial (EDPm) and a form based on the Weibull probability distribution. The EDPm model has three terms: a rate coefficient (k), a damping coefficient (&#955;), and; a breakpoint dose ([dose]B). The rate coefficient governs the initial rate of disinfection prior to the onset of tailing, whilst the breakpoint is the UV dose that indicates the onset of tailing. The damping coefficient controls curvature in the survivor curve. The Weibull model has just two terms: a dimensionless scale parameter (&#946;0), and; a shape parameter (&#946;1). The scale parameter represents the level of disinfection in the tail of the survivor curve (as log10 N/N0), whilst the shape parameter governs the degree of curvature of the survivor data. Each model was assessed against the independent and published UV disinfection data of Nelson (2000) for treatment of faecal coliforms in a range of waste stabilisation pond effluents. Both models were found to be well suited to account for tailing in these UV disinfection data. Overall, the EDPm model gave a better fit to the data than the Weibull model form. To rigorously validate the suitability of the new EDPm and Weibull models a series of experimental trials were designed and carried out in a small-scale pilot UV disinfection unit. These trials included data determined specifically at low values of UV dose (&lt;10,000 &#956;Ws cm-2) to fill the gap in the experimental data of Nguyen (1999). The experimental trials were carried out using a commercially available, UV disinfection unit (LC5TM from Ultraviolet Technology of Australasia Pty Ltd). Purified water contaminated with Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) with a range of feed water flow rates (1 to 4 L min-1) was used. E. coli was selected because it is found in sewage, or water contaminated with faecal material, and is used as an indicator for the presence of enteric pathogens. E. coli should not be present in potable water. The hydrodynamics of water flow within the disinfection unit were established using digital video photography of dye trace studies with Methylene Blue. Nominal UV dose (2,700 to 44,200 &#956;Ws cm-2) was controlled by manipulating the flow rate of feed water through the UV disinfection unit (i.e. residence time), or by varying the exposed length of the control volume of the disinfection unit. The transmittance of the feed water (at 254 nm) was adjusted by the addition of either a soluble UV absorbing agent (International RoastTM instant coffee powder; 0.001 to 0.07 g L-1), or by addition of suspended matter as diatomaceous earth (Celite 503TM; 0.1 to 0.7 g L-1, with a median particle size of 23 &#956;m). The absorbing agent (instant coffee), when in a comparable concentration, was found to produce a greater reduction in water transmission than the suspended material (Celite 503TM). It therefore contributed to a greater reduction in the initial rate of disinfection. Neither agent was found to produce a systematic reduction in the observed efficacy of disinfection however. Experimental results highlight that in the absence of soluble absorbing agents, or suspended solids, the initial rate of disinfection is higher when fewer viable bacteria are initially present. Both the new EDPm and Weibull forms gave a good fit to the experimental data. The EDPm better fitted the data on the basis of residual sum-of-squares (0.03 to 2.13 for EDPm cf. 0.16 to 4.37 for the Weibull form). These models are both of a form suitable for practical use in modelling UV disinfection data. Results of this research highlight the impact of water quality, as influenced by the combined effect of UV dose, suspended solids concentration and UV absorbance, on small-scale UV disinfection for potable water production. Importantly, results show that the concentration of soluble UV absorbing agents and suspended solids are not in themselves sufficient criteria on which to base assessment of efficacy of UV disinfection</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ultraviolet; Disinfection kinetics; Predictive model</field><field name="subject">Drinking water Analysis</field><field name="subject">Drinking water Contamination</field><field name="subject">Water Purification Disinfection</field><field name="subject">Ultraviolet radiation Adverse effects.</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habits, hassle, and health: how do blood donors respond to a temporary deferral due to low haemoglobin?</field><field name="creator">Hillgrove, Tessa</field><field name="description">This thesis explored the impact on whole blood donors of a six month deferral from giving blood due to a low haemoglobin (Hb) concentration. The aims were two-fold: first, to quantify the effect of a temporary deferral on donation patterns once eligible to return, and second, to identify the processes contributing to the effect. The mixed methods design utilised four distinct research phases: statistical analysis of donation patterns over a three year period, surveys of whole blood donors three and twelve months after deferral, and semi-structured interviews with 25 blood donors in the weeks immediately following deferral. Deferral for a low Hb increased the likelihood of non-return in both new and repeat donors, and, amongst those who did return, delayed first return, reduced donation frequency and increased the likelihood of drop-out in later years. Qualitative interviews suggested that, predominantly, individuals give blood because it represents an easy and convenient way to help others, and provides additional rewards, such as enhancing positive self-concepts and a free health check. Returning promptly after deferral appears to be related to three aspects of a person and his/her context: an individual&#8217;s other obligations, especially parenting; the extent to which donation is considered personally rewarding; and whether donation arrangements were facilitated by a range of supports prior to deferral. Over three quarters of surveyed deferred donors seek further advice and investigations from their medical practitioner and nearly half of those are encouraged to change their donation patterns. With the exception of having a low haemoglobin level confirmed at follow-up testing, experiences seeking further investigations were not associated with either intentions or return. Triangulation of findings suggests that deferral disrupts the habit of regular donation, and that this disruption makes donors more vulnerable to changes to their personal circumstances or collection practices. Deferral may also increase the perceived inconvenience of the activity, decrease self-perceptions of competence and good health, and diminish the &#8220;blood donor&#8221; identity. Practical implications of these findings are recommendations that may increase retention of deferred donors, including encouraging donors to return promptly once eligible, enhancing the convenience of blood donation, and improving aspects of the deferral event.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood donation; Blood donor; Mix method; Deferral; Role identity</field><field name="subject">Blood donors.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transnational energy projects and green politics in Thailand and Burma : a critical approach to activism and security.</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Adam</field><field name="description">Most studies in environmental politics have traditionally examined three broad areas: the degradation of the environment; the regulatory regimes governing the environment; or environmental activism within the affluent North. This thesis provides an alternative perspective, exploring environmental activism in the less affluent South. In particular, while human rights and social justice perspectives have historically been largely absent from many environmental movements of the North, this thesis argues that, due to precarious living conditions and authoritarian governance, these issues are of primary importance for environmentalists in the South. As a result this thesis contends that most environmental movements in the South are part of a growing global justice movement and that important cultural diversities within this movement can result in novel forms of resistance and environmental governance. The focus here is on the emancipatory actors within these movements in the South who challenge existing power structures within society. Likewise, by adopting a critical perspective, this thesis argues that large business interests pursue energy projects in the South in the name of energy security and large scale industrial development that are often inappropriate for local development and security needs. To test these hypotheses, four case studies were undertaken that examine transnational gas pipeline and large dam projects at various stages of their development which originate in either Burma (Myanmar) or Thailand. Empirical research, primarily in the form of interviews, undertaken in the countries hosting the various energy projects demonstrated that although environmental activists in the South were assisted by transnational activist networks there were also important local factors that impacted on the emancipatory philosophies, strategies and tactics of many activists in this region. These strategies have achieved some success, with environmental impact assessment (EIA) processes in Thailand now providing a potential opening for the political engagement of communities. Nevertheless, this thesis finds that the power of corporate interests in the international political economy often poses insurmountable barriers for activists to achieve both their short and long term aims. The findings suggest that despite the efforts of activists, local indigenous and ethnic minority communities continue to bear the brunt of the social and environmental costs of transnational energy projects in the South while receiving few of the benefits. Rather than safeguarding these communities from deprivation, these projects often exacerbate existing social tensions and conflicts, resulting in increased community insecurity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand; Burma; energy security; environmental politics; environmental activism; environmental security</field><field name="subject">Green movement</field><field name="subject">Thailand Politics and government 21st century.</field><field name="subject">Burma Politics and government 21st century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Changing fortunes: the history of China Painting in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Avis Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a gap in research regarding South Australian china painting. Although china painting has been practised in Australia for the last 120 years and is held in major Australian collections, it has been little researched and then in a minor role associated with ceramics and studio potters, or as women&#8217;s art/craft. The china painters too, have been little researched. My research identifies the three &#8216;highs&#8217; of the changing fortunes of china painting, and how the practice survived in between. I argue that it was first taught in the city&#8217;s School of Design, Painting and Technical Art in 1894 as a skill for possible industrial employment, due to the initiative of School Principal, Harry Pelling Gill. However china painting classes were discontinued by 1897 due to an economic depression and the fact that the anticipated industry did not eventuate. In 1906 china painting classes were reinstituted in the (re-named) Adelaide School of Art and teacher Laurence Howie was pivotal in that revival. China painting classes ceased during the First World War while Howie served overseas in the Australian Forces, but resumed in 1923 after his return and appointment as Principal of the (renamed) School of Arts and Crafts. The resulting change in the fortunes of china painting was the outcome of the School&#8217;s appropriate training in art and design, and I argue this enabled emerging professional female artists to confidently exhibit china painting alongside their fine art. I will devote a chapter to the important role of the South Australian Society of Arts in facilitating this important public exposure of china painting. The Second World War marked a decline in popularity of china painting. Chapter 5 traces its survival till it burst into popularity again in 1965. Further chapters describe china painting&#8217;s following meteoric rise in fortune and the role played by the South Australian teachers of the art/craft, few of whom had received formal art training. I argue that china painting became a conservative social craft, but nonetheless a serious hobby, pursued by married, middle-class women who strongly believed their work was art, not craft. I will point out how they were visited and influenced by entrepreneurial American teachers, politically active in the art/craft debate in the United States of America. Chapter 8 will chart the steps taken by Australian teachers in the 1980s to break from the American influence and regain an Australian identity in teachers&#8217; organisations and iconography. I will describe the debates that ensued following experimental work exhibited by avant-garde Australian teachers to resolve the art/craft debate regarding china painting in Australia, and the difficulties of maintaining china painting momentum as the majority of practitioners became elderly women. This thesis identifies education of the practitioners as a key factor throughout South Australian china painting history as a way of better understanding the place of china painting within the decorative arts. China painting is currently in decline; nevertheless, as I will point out in my conclusion, there are several future pathways it could take. Only within recent decades have curators and writers shown an increased interest in women&#8217;s decorative arts, including china painting. It is timely to undertake research before existing documentation of china painting is lost.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">South Australia; china painting; women artists; South Australian school of art; Royal South Australian society of arts; hobbyists</field><field name="subject">China painting South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mission accountability: a case study of performance reporting in a large, multi-service community welfare organisation.</field><field name="creator">Saj, Mikolaj Philip</field><field name="description">Community welfare organisations (CWOs)&#185;  perform an important role in society. They are founded on religious or social values that are given expression through their mission statements. In undertaking their work, many command significant economic resources. While the literature shows an increasing use of performance reporting by CWOs, little is known about the processes through which performance reports are developed and deployed. This thesis attempts to fill this lacuna by investigating the structure and process of, and rationale for, performance reporting by a CWO. The research was undertaken through a single organisation case study of performance reporting in a large, multi-service CWO. The study employed an interpretive methodology, which was informed by Strategic Choice Theory, using data that was obtained through interviews, observation of meetings and document analysis. The study found that performance reporting by the organisation was extensive, being undertaken within two distinct but related frameworks: a voluntary system that had been developed within the organisation, and a mandatory system of external reporting. It concluded that performance reporting was essentially the strategic response of a decidedly purposeful, voluntary organisation that chose to operate in a highly regulated welfare system. The contributions to knowledge from this thesis arise from a comprehensive explanation of practice, and a demonstration of the applicability of Strategic Choice Theory to understanding organisational behaviour in a CWO. &#185;  See Appendix 1 for a definition of the term Community Welfare Organisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">performance reporting; accountability; organisational governance; charity; strategic choice theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seasonal regulation of the circadian rhythms of behavioural temperature selection and locomotor activity in Australian sleepy lizards (Tiliqua rugosa, gray; reptilia: scincidae)</field><field name="creator">Ellis, David John</field><field name="description">This research project examined the role of environmental time cues and circadian rhythms in mediating seasonal adjustments in the body temperature and locomotoractivity patterns in the Australian sleepy lizard, Tiliqua rugosa (Gray 1827). The first component of this study investigated whether daily rhythms of behavioural thermoregulation and locomotor activity that T. rugosa displays in the field are endogenous circadian rhythms. In each season, there was significant variation in each of these rhythms in lizards released on laboratory thermal gradients under prevailing light-dark (LD) cycles. Both rhythms persisted when lizards were released in constant darkness (DD) and exhibited the same free-running period suggesting a single circadian pacemaker drives both rhythms. The first component of this study revealed that seasonal changes in the expression of daily behavioural thermoregulatory and locomotor activity rhythms are mediated by the circadian system in T. rugosa. The second component of this project comprised three experiments that determined the relative importance of 24 h LD and temperature cycles (TCs) in entraining the locomotor activity rhythm. In the first experiment, lizards were held under LD 12:12 and were subjected to either a TC of 33:15&#61616;C in phase with the LD cycle or a reversed TC. Following LD 12:12, lizards were maintained under the same TCs but were subjected to DD. Activity was restricted to the thermophase in LD irrespective of the lighting regime and during the period of DD that followed, suggesting entrainment by the TC. In the second experiment, lizards were held under LD 12.5:11.5 and were subjected to one of three treatments; (1) constant 30&#61616;C, (2) normal TC (30:20&#61616;C), or (3) reversed TC. Following LD, all lizards were subjected to DD and constant 30&#61616;C. Post-entrainment free-run records revealed that LD cycles and TCs both entrain locomotor activity rhythms of T. rugosa. Although there was large variation in the phasing of the rhythm in relation to the LD cycle in reversed TC lizards, TCs presented in phase with the LD cycle most accurately synchronised the rhythm to the photocycle. In the third experiment, lizards were held in DD at constant 30&#61616;C before being subjected to a further period of DD and one of four treatments; (1) normal TC (06:00 h to 18:00 h thermophase), (2) delayed TC (12:00 h to 00:00 h thermophase), (3) advanced TC (00:00 h to 12:00 h thermophase) or (4) control (no TC, constant 30&#61616;C). While control lizards continued to free-run in DD at constant temperature, locomotor rhythms of lizards subjected to TCs rapidly entrained to TCs irrespective of whether TCs were phase advanced or delayed by 6 h. The results of this experiment excluded the possibility that masking effects were responsible for locomotor responses of lizards to TCs. This study demonstrated that seasonal changes in the expression of this species&#8223; daily behavioural thermoregulatory and locomotor rhythms are mediated by a circadian system that is sensitive to both light and temperature. The sensitivity of the circadian system to temperature, in particular, may allow T. rugosa to restrict its activity to times of the year that are thermally favourable.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reptiles; lizards; sleepy lizards; Tiliqua rugosa; circadian rhythms; behavioural thermoregulation; locomotor activity; season; daily; body temperature; photoperiod; temperature cycle; environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the temporal release of atomic sodium during a burning black liquor droplet using quantitative planar laser-induced fluorescene (PLIF).</field><field name="creator">Saw, Woei Lean</field><field name="description">The release of sodium during the combustion of black liquor is a significant source of fume formation in a kraft recovery boiler, affecting efficiency in a pulp and paper mill. The fume is deposited on the surface of heat exchanger tubes in the upper furnace, causing fouling and corrosion, especially to the superheaters. This thesis reports on work done to develop improved understanding of fume formation. The mechanisms of sodium release during each stage of black liquor combustion are influenced by the surface temperature. The addition of boron to the black liquor, which debottlenecks the recausticizing plant by a reduction in lime usage, also influences the characteristics of black liquor combustion, such as combustion time and swelling. Previously, no effective measurement technique has been available to quantify sodium concentration in the plume of a burning black liquor droplet with or without boron, or to record the distribution of surface temperature through the time history of a burning droplet. This thesis reports on the adaptation of two techniques for the measurement of the release of atomic sodium and the temperature history, and their application to investigate several aspects of the release of atomic sodium during combustion of black liquor in a flat flame environment. The simultaneous employment of a planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique with an absorption technique has been adapted to allow quantitative measurement of the release of atomic sodium. The absorption technique has been employed to correct for both fluorescence trapping due to absorption and attenuation by high concentration of the atomic sodium in the plume, and for collisional quenching by the other major gas components present in the flat flame. An independent assessment was performed using kinetic calculations, based on measured total sodium that is residual in a particle obtained at different stages in the combustion process. These independent assessments were used to provide greater insight in to the release process and to cross-check. The influence of both the initial diameter of the droplet and addition of boron to the black liquor on the temporal release and the release rate of atomic sodium during the combustion have been performed using the present PLIF technique. The second technique, two-dimensional two-colour optical pyrometry, has been adapted to measure the distribution of surface temperature and the swelling (change in surface area) of a burning black liquor droplet. The influence of surface temperature or the change in the external surface area of the droplet on the release of atomic sodium during the combustion of black liquor has been assessed through concurrent use of both adapted techniques. The highest concentration of atomic sodium was measured in the final stage of combustion that of smelt coalescence, where it is an order of magnitude greater than in the other stages combined. While the extensive release of atomic sodium at high temperature in this final combustion stage occurs in only a relatively small percentage of droplets in a kraft recovery boiler, the effect could still be significant in fume formation. This is because the extensive release is expected to occur in the very small droplets, predominantly generated by splitting or physical ejection. Small droplets will have a very short combustion time and so could remain in suspension within hot gases for sufficient time for extensive release of sodium. These measurements outcomes can be used to support the future development of sub-models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in order to better understand and optimise fume formation in a kraft recovery boiler.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Black liquor; LIF; sodium; surface temperature; boron</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low-cost small-scale wind power generation.</field><field name="creator">Whaley, David Michael</field><field name="description">This research investigates a low-cost generator and power electronics unit for smallscale (&lt;10kW) wind turbines, for both standalone and grid-connected applications. The proposed system uses a high-inductance permanent magnet generator together with a switched-mode rectifier (SMR) to produce a variable magnitude output current. The high inductance characteristic allows the generator to operate as a current source, which has the following advantages over conventional low-inductance generator (voltage source) systems: it offers simple control, and avoids the need for bulky / costly energy storage elements, such as capacitors and inductors. The SMR duty-cycle is controlled in an open-loop manner such that 1) maximum power is obtained for wind speeds below rated, and 2) the output power and turbine speed is limited to safe values above rated wind speed. This topology also has the ability to extract power at low wind speeds, which is well suited to small-scale wind turbines, as there is often limited flexibility in their location and these commonly see low average wind speeds. The thesis is divided into two parts; the first part examines the use of the SMR as a DC-DC converter, for use in standalone applications. The duty-cycle is essentially kept constant, and is only varied for maximum power tracking and turbine speed / power limiting purposes. The SMR operates in to a fixed voltage source load, and has the ability to allow current and hence power to be drawn from the generator even at low wind and hence turbine speeds, making it ideal for battery charging applications. Initial dynamometer testing and limited wind-tunnel testing of a commercially available wind turbine show that turbine power can be maximised and its speed can be limited by adjusting the SMR duty-cycle in an open-loop manner. The second part of the thesis examines the use of the SMR as a DC-AC converter for grid-connected applications. The duty-cycle is now modulated sinusoidally at the mains frequency such that the SMR produces an output current that resembles a fullwave rectified sinewave that is synchronised to the mains voltage. An additional H-bridge inverter circuit and low-pass filter is used to unfold, filter and feed the sinusoidal output current in to the utility grid. Simulation and initial resistive load and preliminary grid-connected tests were used to prove the inverter concept, however, the permanent magnet generator current source is identified as non-ideal and causes unwanted harmonic distortion. The generator harmonics are analysed, and the system performance is compared with the Australian Standard THD requirement. It is concluded that the harmonics are caused by 1) the low-cost single-phase output design, 2) the use of an uncontrolled rectifier, and 3) the finite back-EMF voltage. The extent of these harmonics can be predicted based on the inverter operating conditions. A feed-forward current compensation control algorithm is investigated, and shown to be effective at removing the harmonics caused by the nonideal current source. In addition, the unipolar PWM switching scheme, and its harmonic components are analysed. The low-pass filter design is discussed, with an emphasis on power factor and THD grid requirements. A normalised filter design approach is used that shows how design aspects, such as cutoff frequency and quality factor, affect the filter performance. The filter design is shown to be a trade-off between the output current THD, power loss, and quality factor. The final chapter summarises the thesis with the design and simulation of a 1kW single-phase grid-connected inverter. The inverter is designed based on the low-pass filter and feed-forward compensation analysis, and is shown to deliver an output current to the utility grid that adheres to the Australian Standards.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Switched-mode rectifier; High-inductance PM generator; Grid-connected inverter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and design of single-sided, slotted AMM axial-field permanent magnet machines.</field><field name="creator">Liew, Gene Shane</field><field name="description">Most electrical machines available in the market utilise some form of silicon iron (SI) as the core material. Although SI based electrical machine manufacturing methods are well established and simple, SI has significant iron losses specifically in high frequency variable-speed motor drive applications. Two alternative magnetic materials have recently been developed: amorphous magnetic material (AMM) and soft magnetic composite, which can each offer unique characteristics that can be utilised to improve the performance of electric machines. AMM offers extremely low iron losses which makes it a good candidate for high-efficiency and variable-speed motor applications. However, due to handling and cutting limitations, AMM has not been utilised widely in rotating electrical machines. A commercially viable AMM cutting technique was recently developed by the industrial partner of this project. It is thus now practical to cut the AMM ribbon into a machine stator, particularly for axial-field stators which generally require less cutting than radial-field stators. This thesis investigates an innovative motor design based on applying the cut AMM in an axial-field permanent magnet (AFPM) machine for general drive applications. It includes a detailed review of the analytical approach, finite element analysis (FEA), iron loss investigation and prototype performance comparisons. Analytical analysis of the AFPM machine was performed and the key design variables were evaluated to optimise the design parameters based on the use of AMM. The AMM cutting constraints, design and performances trade-offs were also investigated in the design. The research study provides a design procedure to determine the basic physical size and configuration (e.g. combination of the number of slots and poles, slot width and depth, number of winding layers, air gap length, magnet thickness) based on certain basic specifications. In addition, a comprehensive investigation was conducted on the iron loss of various materials to compare these with AMM. Due to the three dimensional (3D) nature of the AFPM structure, the theoretical design was validated using 3D FEA and extensive simulation results are provided. A number of AMM AFPM prototypes were successfully designed and constructed. Due to limited available materials, the prototypes were built using uncoatedAMMribbon which has substantially higher iron loss characteristics. Nevertheless, it is believed that it would still provide a valuable understanding of the real machine characteristics and allow initial design validation. The prototype was tested in a custom-built test rig to validate the analytical and 3D FEA predictions. Overall, a good correspondence between the results and predictions has been achieved. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate and demonstrate the characteristics of the AMM prototype machines which are based on fractional-slot concentratedwinding single-sided AFPM machines. This includes comparisons against identical silicon iron and soft magnetic composite prototypes. In addition, the laboratory experimental results also highlighted the significant effect of the open-circuit losses on the overall machine performance. Therefore, the open-circuit loss components which includes bearing, windage, magnet and iron losses were separated based on 3D FEA and experimental results. The above research studies demonstrated the potential and feasibility of cut AMM to produce highly efficient AFPM machines. In addition, the innovative cutting technique also has the potential for mass production of low-cost AMM machines. The research work in this thesis makes a significant contribution to the design of axial-field permanent magnet machines based on AMM.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slotted AMM; single-sided; axial-field permanent magnet; iron loss; open-circuit loss; amorphous magnetic material</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temperate bacteriophages and the molecular epidemiology of antibiotic resistance in Salmonella enterica.</field><field name="creator">Tan, Sophia</field><field name="description">Foodborne diseases caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella represent an important public health problem worldwide (Zhao et al., 2003). The transmission of Salmonella between animals and humans has been well established in epidemiological studies. In the case of complicated illness caused by Salmonella where antibiotics need to be administered, treatment can be compromised if the infecting organism is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial agent. This study and earlier studies have shown that many Salmonella carry temperate bacteriophages as lysogens. Many of these bacteriophages are capable of mediating generalised transduction (Schicklmaier and Schmieger, 1995; Schicklmaier et al., 1998; Mmolawa et al., 2002). Schmieger and Schicklmaier (1999) demonstrated that bacteriophages ES18 and PDT17 are capable of transduction of antibiotic resistance genes from DT104. Phage-mediated transduction of antibiotic resistance genes has been largely neglected in the study of genetic transfer of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This study investigates whether bacteriophages exist in antibiotic resistant Salmonella isolates. Such temperate phages in antibiotic resistant isolates could play a significant role in the transfer of resistance to other species of enteric bacteria, such as E. coli. Molecular epidemiology studies of antibiotic resistance genes were undertaken with Salmonella isolates from chicken, pig and human sources that were subjected to PCR for ampicillin (blaTEM-1), tetracycline (tetA, tetB) and streptomycin (aadA1, aadA2, strA, strB) resistance genes as well as Class 1 integrons. The blaTEM-1 gene was widely detected in isolates from pigs and chickens but rarely detected in human isolates. The tetB gene was more commonly found in pig isolates, while the tetA gene was associated with tetracycline resistance in chicken isolates. The strA and strB genes were responsible for streptomycin resistance in the S. Typhimurium isolates while the aadA1 gene was commonly detected in S. Kiambu and S. Virchow isolates. The aadA2 gene was associated with streptomycin resistance in the S. Ohio isolates from pigs. Class 1 integrons were widely distributed across serovars tested from chicken, pig and human sources. Temperate bacteriophages were induced using mitomycin C from antibiotic resistant Salmonella. These phages were able to infect antibiotic-sensitive Salmonella isolates from humans. Bacteriophages induced from one S. Sofia isolate also plaqued on Shigella flexneri. Bacteriophages induced from one S.Kiambu isolate and S. Typhimurium DB21 with an inserted Tn10 transposon (S. Typhimurium DB21 Tn10) were capable of transducing ampicillin and tetracycline resistance, respectively into S. Enteritidis PT1 isolates by in vitro methods. The molecular basis for resistance was established in subsequent PCR for antibiotic resistance genes in donor and recipient strains. This finding, in particular in the wild-type S. Kiambu strain, indicates that Salmonella from a natural source are able to infect and transfer antibiotic resistance by generalised transduction in controlled laboratory experiments. This current study has investigated the transfer of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance from a wild-type Salmonella strain and a laboratory strain of Salmonella to wild-type Salmonella bacteria as it occurs within the normal flora of the chicken gastrointestinal tract. It was demonstrated that the genetic transfer of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance genes as well as Class 1 integrons can occur within the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Transfer of tetracycline and ampicillin resistance could be demonstrated both in vitro and by using bacteriophage lysates obtained from in vivo studies in transduction experiments. It was clearly shown that bacteriophage isolated from chicken faeces and caeca could infect antibiotic sensitive recipient Salmonella. Interaction between phages of the administered Salmonella strains may be occuring with phages of bacteria in the normal flora allowing previously inactive phage in the indigenous flora to plaque on indicator strains. Additionally, strong evidence was presented to suggest that the environment of the chicken gastrointestinal tract could mediate phage type conversion in recipient and transductant strains. Phage typing of these recipient and transductant strains demonstrated a trend for recipient strains to become more resistant to phages in the S. Enteritidis typing panel. This led to weakened phage reactions such RDNC (reaction does not conform) and untypable. The acquisition of phages may be a way for Salmonella to enhance competitive fitness and generate new strains in order to evolve and diversify. Or the acquisition of plasmids either by transduction or conjugation may also mediate phage type conversion. MLVA typing was performed on selected recipient, donor and transductant strains. The changes to tandem repeat loci in Salmonella isolates that have passed through a chicken gastrointestinal tract have not been described before. The changes to fragment length suggest that the bacterial chromosome is undergoing rearrangement; this may be attributed to a number of factors including acquisition of phages, prophage integration into tRNA sites, slipped-strand mispairing or the adaption to changing environment, in this case the chicken gastrointestinal tract. This study has provided molecular epidemiological data on the antibiotic resistance genes and integrons present in Australian Salmonella isolates from human and animal sources. Information on the role of bacteriophages in the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in vitro and in a chicken gastrointestinal tract has also been established.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salmonella; antibiotic resistance; bacteriophage; phage-mediated transduction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimal residual disease in chronic myeloid leukaemia after imatinib treatment.</field><field name="creator">Ross, David Morrall</field><field name="description">Around 50% of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients who remain on imatinib treatment for more than 5 years will achieve a complete molecular response (CMR), defined by undetectable BCR-ABL mRNA in a sensitive reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) assay. Given the increasing importance of CMR on imatinib therapy the primary aim of this study was to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of MRD detection to allow a more accurate estimation of relapse risk when therapy is withdrawn. Firstly, we investigated ways of improving the sensitivity of RT-PCR methods for the detection of BCR-ABL mRNA. Secondly, we investigated the use of the patient-specific BCR-ABL gene for the detection of MRD. Thirdly, we conducted a multi-centre clinical trial of imatinib withdrawal in selected CML patients in a stable CMR. This clinical trial provided patient samples that could be used to test our optimized MRD assays, and provided clinical data on the risk and patterns of relapse after withdrawal of imatinib therapy. The trial is ongoing, but an interim analysis of the study data was performed. In 22 patients the estimated probability of molecular relapse after imatinib withdrawal was 54%, and 60% of relapses occurred within the first 4 months. The average detection limit of BCR-ABL mRNA by RQ-PCR is estimated at around 4.5 log below the level of BCR-ABL prior to commencing treatment. The number of leukaemic cells at diagnosis is around 10&#185; &#178;, so the number of residual leukaemic cells in CMR might vary from zero to over a million. We hypothesized that the amount of residual leukaemia in CMR is variable between patients, and that this heterogeneity is a determinant of the risk of relapse when treatment is withdrawn. We developed more sensitive methods for the detection of BCR-ABL and tested these methods in samples from our study patients. We showed that random pentadecamer (15-mer) primers improved the efficiency of reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and resulted in a lower detection limit of BCR-ABL mRNA. We also developed a novel nested RT-PCR method using real-time PCR for the second round of the reaction, and this resulted in a lower detection limit of BCR-ABL in patient samples. The utility of this nested RT-PCR method was limited by a false positive rate of 2-3% in the HeLa cell line that we used as our negative control. Consequently, we examined the detection of the patient-specific genomic BCR-ABL sequence as an alternative to RT-PCR. Breakpoints in BCR and ABL1 in CML patients are widely dispersed over 3 kb and 150 kb, respectively. Therefore, the BCR-ABL genomic sequence is essentially unique to each patient. We sequenced the genomic breakpoints of 43 CML patients. We showed that the distribution of breakpoints in BCR and ABL1 was non-random, but we were unable to identify any genomic feature that determined the specific location of individual breakpoints. We developed a novel BCR-ABL DNA Q-PCR method for 12 of the study patients, and in 11 of the patients BCR-ABL DNA was detected when the patient was in a CMR, confirming that this method was more sensitive than RQ-PCR. Contrary to our hypothesis, the detection of BCR-ABL DNA was not predictive of relapse. In most patients who relapsed there was a significant increase in BCR-ABL DNA prior to mRNA relapse. Two patients had stable levels of BCR-ABL DNA measurable on multiple occasions, but remained in remission after 6 months and 15 months, respectively. We have shown that a stable CMR after the withdrawal of imatinib therapy does not necessarily indicate the eradication of leukaemia.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic myeloid leukaemia; minimal residual disease; translocation; polymerase chain reaction; ABL kinase inhibitors; imatinib</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulating multiple systems of systems using the high level architecture.</field><field name="creator">Cramp, Anthony</field><field name="description">Simulation provides the ability to obtain results from, and analyse, a system without physically building the system. These results can be used to inform the actual construction of the physical system, how best to use a system, how best to integrate a system with another system, and so on. A simulation can also be used to train and educate the end-users of a system either before the system is actually produced or when the availability of the actual system is limited. Most end systems are in some way composed of subsystems. The subsystems themselves may be composed of subsystems. This type of architecture is generically referred to as a system of systems. For example, a ship is composed of a hull, engines, sensors, etc. The engine system may be composed of the fuel and cooling subsystems, for example. Systems constructed this way have numerous benefits including allowing subsystems to be built independently of each other (after creating well defined interfaces), and allowing for subsystems to be replaced without affecting other subsystems. These same benefits are desirable in the construction of a simulation of a system. One simulation framework that supports these ideals is the High Level Architecture (HLA). The HLA is an international modelling and simulation framework that specifically provides for distributed simulation. The HLA uses the term federate for component simulations that are then brought together in a distributed computing environment to form a federation. The HLA defines a data model for documenting the data interfaces of the federates and the application programming interface used by the federates to communicate data. A simulation of a systems of systems architecture can be implemented in the HLA by creating federates for each subsystem and defining the data communicated between subsystems in terms of HLA&#8217;s data model. HLA&#8217;s default communication model defines publishers and subscribers of data classes. The HLA provides class based filtering, i.e., a federate only receives data for a data class to which it has subscribed. However, HLA&#8217;s default communication model has no notion of direct &#8216;wiring&#8217; between federates. Thus, it is not possible to have data sent to a specific federate. This creates a problem if multiple instances of a system of systems are simulated concurrently, which may be desirable so as to observe the interactions between systems. In this case, the data sent within one system is exposed to all other systems in the simulation. This thesis explores this problem of simulating multiple systems of systems using the HLA. The problem is stated formally by introducing the concept of a message path and showing that a federation containing multiple systems of systems contains incorrect message paths which communicate intra-system data between systems. Three methods are presented and shown to solve the problem by either eliminating the incorrect message paths or allowing a receiving federate to determine whether intra-system data was delivered via an incorrect message path. The three solutions are Local Data Filtering (LDF), Data Distribution Management (DDM), and Federation Communities (FC). The LDF solution marks all intra-system data with a system identifier, allowing receivers to distinguish whether they should process it. The DDM method uses a service defined by the HLA that essentially provides an automated version of the LDF solution. The FC method restricts one federation to simulating one system and requires a multiple system simulation to enable inter-federation communication, something that is not defined in the HLA. These three methods are analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The quantitative analysis looks at performance overhead imposed by each method and how well each method reduces the number of incorrect intra-system messages communicated. The qualitative analysis is presented in terms of identifying the complexity of implementing each method for a specific systems of systems federation: the election process for the Australian federal government. The thesis concludes that the LDF method is simple to understand but potentially finicky to implement and is wasteful of network resources. The DDMmethod is advantageous in that it is a service defined by the HLA standard. However, the implementation of the DDM services by a Runtime Infrastructure (RTI) is not defined by the HLA. Thus, the performance of the DDMmethod is coupled to a specific RTI and its configurability. The FC method achieves an ideal of replicating the simulation of a single system without modification to achieve a multisystem simulation. However, it requires and inter-federation communicationmechanism that is not defined by the HLA. The FC method introduces extra latency and reduced throughput to inter-system messages in a Local Area Network (LAN) environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">distributed simulation; HLA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the interdisciplinary requirements of 3D geological models.</field><field name="creator">Riordan, Sarah J.</field><field name="description">Despite increasing computer power, the requirement to upscale 3D geological models for dynamic reservoir simulation purposes is likely to remain in many commercial environments. This study established that there is a relationship between sandbody size, cell size and changes to predictions of reservoir production as grids are upscaled. The concept of a cell width to sandbody width ratio (CSWR) was developed to allow the comparison of changes in reservoir performance as grids are upscaled. A case study of the Flounder Field in the Gippsland Basin resulted in the interpretation of three depositional environments in the intra-Latrobe reservoir interval. The sandbody dimensions associated with these depositional environments were used to build a series of 3D geological models. These were upscaled vertically and horizontally to numerous grid cell sizes. Results from over 1400 dynamic models indicate that if the CSWR is kept below 0.3 there will be a strong correlation between the average production from the upscaled grids compared to those of a much finer grid, and there will be less than 10% variation in average total field production. If the CSWR is between 0.3 and 1, there could be up to 30% difference, and once the CSWR exceeds 1.0 there is only a weak relationship between the results from upscaled grids and those of finer grids. As grids are upscaled the morphology of bodies in facies models changes, the distribution of petrophysical properties is attenuated and the structure is smoothed. All these factors result in a simplification of the fluid flow pathways through a model. Significant loss of morphology occurs when cells are upscaled to more than a half the width of the reservoir body being modelled. A simple rule of thumb is established &#8212; if the geological features of a model cannot be recognised when looking at a layer in the upscaled grid, the properties of the upscaled grid are unlikely to be similar to those of the original grid and the predictions of dynamic models may vary significantly from those of a finer grid. This understanding of the influence of sandbody size on the behaviour of upscaled dynamic models can be used in the planning stages of a reservoir modelling project. Two simple charts have been created. The first chart is for calculating the approximate number of cells in a model before it is built. The second chart is for comparing the proposed cell size against the CWSR, so that the predicted discrepancy between the ultimate production from the upscaled grid and one with much smaller cells can be assessed. These two charts enhance discussion between all interested disciplines regarding the potential dimensions of both static and upscaled dynamic models during the planning stage of a modelling project, and how that may influence the results of dynamic modelling.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flounder Field; Gippsland Basin; facies model; 3D reservoir characterisation upscaling; grid cell size</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boundary-layer flows in non-Newtonian fluids.</field><field name="creator">Dabrowski, Paul Peter</field><field name="description">We examine the boundary-layer flow of generalised Newtonian fluids.

This thesis also describes the process of statistically comparing results obtained from multiple co-located independent measurement sources. Also included are statistical comparisons made between meteor radars at BP,Darwin, Northern Territory, and Davis Station, Antarctica, with other independent sources of measurement. Previous meteor radar systems have generally been low powered (&#8764;8 kW peak) and as such could only afford low count rates at frequencies of the order of 50 MHz. While it has been shown that the echo detection rate is inversely proportional to frequency to the power of 1.5, the use of lower VHF frequencies within Australia is restricted by government regulations. As such, this has lead to the development of a high powered meteor radar system at 55 MHz which has served to facilitate higher echo rates at this frequency. The aim of improving the echo rate is to improve the statistical accuracy of results generated by the meteor technique. Also presented are descriptions of the meteor radar systems used to provide the data for this study and the basic principles of the meteor technique. Basic descriptions of the other systems and the techniques used to provide data for comparison are also presented. Two key components in the development of the high-powered meteor system are the high-powered all-sky crossed-dipole transmit antenna and the high-powered 1:2 splitter-combiner required to drive the antenna. The antenna was designed using standard equations for Yagi-Uda antenna design found in literature and modeled using the EZNEC modeling programe. After successful modeling, the antenna was prototyped and refined into a low powered version to investigate the antenna&#8217;s performance characteristics. Once the performance of the antenna was verified, the process of upgrading the antenna to handle the full output power from a VTX transmitter was performed. This upgrade also spawned the design and development of the highpowered 1:2 splitter-combiner which would be used to feed the high-powered version of the antenna. The successful operation of the high-powered system over several periods of observation has allowed for a more in-depth investigation into the statistical reliability of the meteor technique. Along with the comparison of standard atmospheric parameters, i.e. temperatures and wind velocity, the high-powered system has allowed for the verification of the relationship between echo rate and radar parameters found by McKinley, which is frequently referred to in many papers dealing with meteor observations. Along with the comparisons made with the results from the high-powered meteor radar system at BP, comparisons of atmospheric parameters derived from meteor observations and other techniques were made at Davis Station and Darwin. Of particular interest is the unique comparison of atmospheric winds made at Davis between two independent meteor radar systems and a Medium Frequency (MF) radar. Previous comparison studies have only enjoyed the benefit of having two independent sources of measurement to compare and as such have not allowed for a unique solution to be obtained for the uncertainties of the techniques using the method of Hocking et al. [2001]. Davis Station is unique in that it has two independent meteor radars in addition to a MF radar. This has enabled for the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom in the statistical comparison process, and as such has allowed for unique solutions to be determined for the uncertainties when comparing two independent techniques; i.e. meteor and MF wind comparisons. Atmospheric temperatures in the Mesospheric and Lower Thermospheric (MLT) region were determined through the use of meteor diffusion coefficients and derived atmospheric pressure models at Davis Station, BP and Darwin. Comparisons are made between the meteor technique and other co-located independent measurements. These include; airglow, satellite and falling sphere measurements at Davis Station, airglow and two independent satellite measurements at BP and two independent satellite observations at Darwin. This thesis as a whole demonstrates the successful operation of the highpowered ST/meteor hybrid radar at BP. It also demonstrates the successful comparisons of MLT winds and temperatures made between meteor radar and other independent sources of MLT measurements. The validation of using the high-powered meteor radar at BP coupled with the successful comparison of atmospheric parameters derived using the meteor technique and other forms of MLT observations serves to re-affirm the statistical accuracy and benefit of the meteor technique in observations of the MLT region.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meteor radar; mesosphere; atmoshere; temperature; wind velocity; airglow; satellite; MF radar</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the issues of language contact and language shift in Tok Pisin - focusing on two "non-standard" varieties: highlands pidgin and anglicised pidgin.</field><field name="creator">Wakizaka, Miwako</field><field name="description">Tok Pisin is the most prevailing common language in Papua New Guinea. It was originally an English lexifier pidgin language and has developed as the virtual universal lingua franca in this multilingual country where over 850 indigenous languages are spoken today (Nekitel 1998). The term Tok Pisin covers a large number of varieties due to the various social and linguistic backgrounds of its speakers. Traditionally, the rural varieties which are spoken in Coastal and Island areas are regarded as mainstream Tok Pisin and previous studies have mainly focused on these varieties. However, since the social and linguistic situation in the country has continuously changed and the language contact between Tok Pisin and both substratum languages and the superstratum language, English, continues, the varieties which were regarded as &#8220;non-standard&#8221; seem to play an important role, especially in the context of language contact and language shift today. Therefore, with respect to the roles that &#8220;non-standard&#8221; varieties play and their features, many gaps still remain. Most studies have focused on standard varieties. In order to fill in the gaps, this study will address the issues of language contact and language shift in Tok Pisin, mainly focusing on two &#8220;nonstandard&#8221; varieties. One is Highlands Pidgin which is spoken mainly in the Highlands area of the country. Because of the increase of emigrant population from Highlands to other regions, it seems that Highlands Pidgin impacts on other regional varieties of Tok Pisin. First, the characteristics which have been considered to be Highlands features are reconsidered by reanalysing previous studies and examining the author&#8217;s primary data. Then the role that Highlands Pidgin plays in the current language situation in Papua New Guinea is discussed. The other &#8220;non-standard&#8221; variety considered here is the anglicised variety. It has been pointed out that Tok Pisin is currently undergoing &#8220;decreolisation&#8221;, that is, it is gradually losing its own features and assimilating to English. However, the degree of the anglicisation can very with situations, speakers and topics and, although earlier studies provide many important findings, few recent studies have been undertaken. Thus, the degree of anglicisation is examined according to each linguistic component including phonology, morphology, lexicon and syntax based on primary data. As one of the parameters of anglicisation, code switching between Tok Pisin and English is also examined using the Matrix Language-Frame model proposed by Myers-Scotton (1993). Following the analysis of the two varieties, some sociolinguistic considerations are provided in order to capture the situation in which language contact and language shift take place. In conclusion, based on the author&#8217;s observations and analysis, this study proposes the argument that there is little reason to rule out the &#8220;non-standard&#8221; varieties and that Tok Pisin has been a language completely distinct from English, which supports Smith&#8217;s (2002) viewpoint. Also, it illustrates a description of current Tok Pisin which coexists with English. Whether the situation continues or not in the future is open to question; however, the structural features of Tok Pisin and its remarkable vitality which are revealed here can inform the study of language contact, language shift and language maintenance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tok Pisin; Highlands pidgin; Anglicised pidgin; language contact; language shift; standardisation; Anglicisation; decreolisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of limited site investigations on the design and performance of pile foundations.</field><field name="creator">Arsyad, Ardy</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis focuses on the quantification of the effect of limited site investigations on the design and performance of pile foundations. Limited site investigation is one of the main causes of structural foundation failures. Over the last 30 years, most site investigations conducted for infrastructure projects have been dictated by minimum cost and time of completion, rather than meeting the need to appropriately characterise soil properties (Institution of Civil Engineers 1991; Jaksa et al. 2003). As a result, limited site investigations remain common, resulting in a higher risk of structural foundation failure, unforeseen additional construction, and/or repair costs. Also, limited site investigations can result in over-designing foundations, leading to increased and unnecessary cost (ASFE 1996). Based on the reliability examination method for site investigations introduced by Jaksa et al. (2003) and performed by Goldsworthy (2006), this research investigated the effect of limited site investigations on the design of pile foundations. This was achieved by generating three-dimensional random fields to obtain a virtual site consisting of soil properties at certain levels of variability, and by simulating various numbers of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and pile foundations on the generated site. Once the site and the CPTs were simulated, the cone tip resistance (qc) was profiled along the vertical and horizontal axes. The simulated qc profiles yielded by the CPTs were then used to compute axial pile load capacity termed the pile foundation design based on site investigations (SI). In parallel, the axial pile load capacity of the simulated pile foundation utilising the &#8220;true&#8221; cone tip resistance along the simulated pile was also determined. This is termed &#8220;the true&#8221; design, or the benchmark pile foundation design, and referred to as pile foundation design based on complete knowledge (CK). At the end of this process, the research compared the pile foundation designs based on SI and those based on CK. The reliability of the foundation design based on SI was analysed with a probabilistic approach, using the Monte Carlo technique. The results indicated that limited site investigations have a significant impact on the design of pile foundations. The results showed that minimum sampling efforts result in a high risk of over- or under-designing piles. More intensive sampling efforts, in contrast, led to a low risk of under- or over-design. The results also indicated that the levels of spatial variability of the soil are notable factors that affect the effectiveness of site investigations. These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a site investigation in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">site investigation; pile foundation; reliability; design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of stochastic control and switching: from Parrondo&#8217;s games to electrical circuits.</field><field name="creator">Allison, Andrew Gordon</field><field name="description">The first half of this thesis deals with the line of thought that leads to the development of discrete games of chance as models in statistical physics, with an emphasis on analysis of Parrondo&#8217;s games.

A large-scale mensurative experiment was used to investigate the distribution of two size classes of macrofauna with distance from the reef edge across three locations in northeastern New Zealand. The role of reef-associated predators, the snapper (Pagrus auratus Sparidae) and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii Palinuridae), was investigated using established marine reserves at each location. Consistent patterns were found in a few large-bodied fauna. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, whilst the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea were more abundant further away from the reef. Dosinia subrosea and another bivalve, Myadora striata, exhibited lower biomass at sites with higher densities of snapper and rock lobster. In contrast, small-bodied macrofauna showed no consistent patterns with distance from the reef or among sites with different predator populations. It was hypothesised that predation was driving the distribution of large bivalves. An experiment was done to investigate this model using D. subrosea. Equal densities of this bivalve were established in plots either with or without cages at sites either inside or outside of reserves. Significant predation was detected, but only inside reserves. Much of this mortality could be specifically attributed to predation by large rock lobsters, given the distinctive marks on the valves of dead D. subrosea. Inside reserves, predators are not only more abundant but also larger. It was hypothesised that different size classes of predators would result in different levels of predation. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate this model. Lobsters of all sizes chose D. subrosea over the heavier shelled D. anus. Small lobsters chose to prey on small D. subrosea and large lobsters more frequently chose larger prey. The distributions of these two bivalve species at protected (large predators) and fished sites (small predators) reflected the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. Results suggested that rock lobster populations are capable, where their size structure is not truncated by fishing pressure, of controlling population-level dynamics of bivalve communities adjacent to reefs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The arts in the New Zealand curriculum: from policy to practice</field><field name="creator">Mansfield, Janet Elaine</field><field name="description">In this thesis I portray through a history of music and art education in New Zealand the forms knowledge production took in these subject and the discourses within which they were embedded. This enables a more comprehensive understanding of curriculum and unearths connections with what Lyotard (1984) described as 'grand narrative' used to legitimate knowledge claims and practices at certain historical moments. Through such histories we may chart the progress of European civilization within the local context and provide the historical raison d'&#195;&#170;tre for the present state of affairs in music and arts areas of the New Zealand curriculum. Curriculum and its 'reform' representing in part the distribution of public goods and services, has been embroiled in a market project. I seek to expose the politics of knowledge involved in the construction of the notion of The Arts within a neo-liberal policy environment. This environment has involved the deliberate construction of a 'culture of enterprise and competition' (Peters, 1995: 52) and, in the nurturing of conditions for trans-national capital's freedom of movement, a withdrawal from Keynesian economic and social policy, an assault on the welfare state. The thesis delves beyond the public face of policy-making. It follows and scrutinizes critically the birth of The Arts in the New Zealand Curriculum to the production of the first draft of the proposed policy presented by the Ministry of Education in 1999. I examine it as a site of the 'accumulation of meaning' (Derrida, 1981: 57) through a discussion of the history of meaning of 'art' and 'art' education. There is much of value in the Draft document. In particular, the arts have been invested with a new intellectual weight and the professionalism, passion and dedication of those involved in its writing shines through in each of the subject areas within the arts. However, through a process of analysis, I will show that there has been, in fact, a fashioning of a new container for the isolation of artistic knowledge. This is despite official sentiments mentioning possibilities within the document for flourishing separate Music, Art, Dance, and Drama education that implies increased curriculum space. The Draft Arts (1999) document both disguises and rehashes the 'master narrative' of universal rationality and artistic canons and is unlikely to work towards revitalising or protecting local cultural identities though not through lack of intention. I use Lyotard's notion of 'performativity' to critique notions of 'skills' and their 'development' which are implicitly and explicitly stated within the 'levels' of development articulated in the Draft Arts (1999) document. It is argued that this conflation works to enforce cultural homogeneity. There are clear dangers that the Draft Arts' (1999) conception of 'Arts Literacies' might operate as mere functional literacy in the service of the dominant culture's discourse of power and knowledge-one which celebrates the art-as-commodity ideal. It is argued that the Education Ministry's theoretical and epistemological construction of The Arts as one area of learning is unsound, and in fact represents a tightening of modernism's hierarchical notion of culture. New Zealand, now post-colonial or post-imperialist, both bi-cultural and multi-cultural, is situated on the south-western edge of the Pacific Rim. Culturally, it now includes Pacific Island, Asian, and new immigrants, as well as Maori and people of European descent. This therefore necessitates aesthetic practices which, far from promoting a set of universal principles for the appreciation of art - one canonical rule or 'standard' - recognise and reflect cultural difference. Merely admitting cultural difference is inadequate. By working away critically at the deeply held ethno-centric assumptions of modernism, its selective traditions concerned with 'practices, meanings, gender, "races", classes' (Pollock, 1999: 10), its universalising aesthetics of beauty, formal relations, individuality, authenticity or originality, and self-expression, of 'negativity and alienation, and abstraction' (Huyssens, 1986: 209), it is possible to begin to understand the theoretical task of articulating difference with regard to aesthetics. The development of the arts curriculum in New Zealand is placed within the modernism/postmodernism and modernity/postmodernity debates. These debates have generated a number of questions which are forcing us to re-examine the assumptions of modernism. The need for the culture of modernism to become self-critical of its own determining assumptions in order to come to understand its cultural practices, is becoming an urgent theoretical task, especially in disciplines and fields concerned with the transmission of acquired learning and the production of new knowledge. The culture of modernism is often taken as the historical succession of twentieth century avant-gardes (B. Smith, 1998) yet the culture of modernity, philosophically speaking, strictly begins with Ren&#195;&#169; Descartes several hundred years earlier, with a pre-history in the Florentine renaissance and the re-discovery of Graeco-Roman artistic and literary forms going back to the thirteenth century. Aesthetic modernism identifies with consumer capitalism and its major assumptions are rationalist, individualist and focus upon the autonomy of both the 'work of art' and the artist at the expense of the artwork, its reception and audience within its localised cultural context. The ideological features of humanism/liberalism - its privileging of the individual subject, the moral, epistemological and aesthetic privileging of the author/artist - are examined as forces contributing to modernism's major values (or aesthetic). Such approaches, it is argued, were limited for dealing with difference. The security and reproductive nature of modernistic approaches to curriculum in the arts areas are destabilized by thinking within the postmodern turn, and the effects of the changes questioning the basic epistemological and metaphysical assumptions in disciplinary fields including art/literature, artchitecture, philosophy and political theory, are registered here, within the field of the education in and through the arts. In a seminal description or report on knowledge, Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard defines postmodernism as 'incredulity towards metanarratives' (1984: xxiv). Postmodernism, he argues, is 'undoubtedly part of the modern', 'not modernism at its end but in its nascent state and that state is constant (1984: 79). After Lyotard, postmodernism might be seen, therefore, not just as a mode or manner or attitude towards the past, but also as a materializing discourse comprising a dynamic reassessment and re-examination of modernism and modernity's culture. The thinking subject (the cogito) seen as the fount of all knowledge, its autonomy, and transparency, its consideration as the centre of artistic and aesthetic virtuosity and moral action, is subjected to intellectual scrutiny and suspicion. The need for an aesthetics of difference is contextualised through an examination of western hierarchies of art and the aesthetics of marginalized groups. I use the theories of poststructuralist, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Fran&#195;&#167;ois Lyotard, to examine the concept of difference. These theoretical inspirations are used as methodological tools for offsetting the privileging of the liberal individual and individualism. Rather than the mere consideration of difference in curricula, I seek to insert and establish the principle of an aesthetics of difference into relations of pedagogy and curricula. The implications for professional practice resulting from a recognition of a politics of representation are examined and a politics of difference. I argue that art education in all its manifestations can no longer avoid the deeper implications of involvement with representation, including forms of gender, ethnicity and class representation as well as colonial representation. The Western canon's notion of 'artists' and their 'art', often based upon white bourgeois male representations and used in many primary school classrooms, are part and parcel of 'social and political investments in canonicity', a powerful 'element in the hegemony of dominant social groups and interests' (Pollock, 1999: 9). Difference is not appreciated in this context. School art, music, and drama classrooms can become sites for the postmodern questioning of representation of 'the other'. In this context, an aesthetics of difference insists upon too, the questioning of images supporting hegemonic discourses, images which have filled the spaces in the 'chinks and cracks of the power/knowledge-apparati' (Teresa de Lauretis, 1987 cited in Pollock, 1999: 7-8). What would an 'eccentric rereading', a rediscovery of what the canon's vicarly cloak disguises and reveals, mean for music, and for the individual arts areas of the curriculum? I hope to reveal the entanglements of the cultural dynamics of power through an examination of the traditions of Truth and Beauty in imagery which are to be disrupted by inserting into the canon the principle of the aesthetics of difference. Art education as a politics of representation embraces art's constitutive role in ideology. This is to be exposed as we seek to unravel and acknowledge which kinds of knowledges are legitimised and privileged by which kinds of representations. Which kinds of narratives, historical or otherwise, have resulted in which kinds of depictions through image? A recognition of the increasing specification of the subject demands also the careful investigation of colonial representation, the construction of dubious narratives about our history created through visual imaging and its provision of complex historical references. How have art, music, dance, drama been used in the service of particular political and economic narratives? Through revisioning the curriculum from a postmodern perspective, suggestions are made for an alternative pedagogy, which offsets the ideological features of humanism/liberalism, one in which an aesthetics of difference might pervade cultural practices - 'systems of signification', 'practices of representation' (Rizvi, 1994). I draw upon Lyotard's notion of 'small narratives' (1984), and present an investigation of what the democratic manifestation of 'the differend', and multiple meaning systems, might indicate in terms of 'differencing' music education as a site in which heterogenous value systems and expression may find form.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latitudinal variation in the demography and life history of a temperate marine herbivorous fish Odax pullus (Labridae)</field><field name="creator">Laman Trip, Elizabeth Danie&#768;le.</field><field name="description">This thesis examined latitudinal variation in the demography and life history of a temperate marine herbivorous fish, Odax pullus (Labridae). Over 1000 individuals were collected at six locations across ~13o of latitude, and an age-based approach was used to establish the patterns of variation in growth rate, size-at-age, development rate (size- and age at- maturity and -at-sex change), life span, and rate of physiological ageing. Firstly, an otolithbased ageing procedure was developed following successful validation of the daily and annual periodicity of opaque zone formation, and histological analysis of the reproductive biology of O. pullus was combined with sex-specific demographic information to establish a diagnosis of monandric protogynous sex change. Secondly, a 'biota-environment linkage' approach was used to explore the patterns of geographic variation in life history and the effects of potential underlying environmental factors (sea surface temperature, species density, habitat and food availability, exposure, and extrinsic mortality). Significant latitudinal trends in growth, body size, development, and longevity were identified along a broad North -  South gradient, with individuals growing slower, maturing and changing sex later, achieving larger body sizes and living longer at higher latitudes. The main effects of latitude on the phenotypic response of life histories were related to the latitudinal gradient in environmental temperature. Species density and habitat (food) availability also affected the responses in body size and development, and these effects were detected on a local spatial scale. Comparison with a temperate carnivorous labrid, Notolabrus fucicola, revealed no differences in the response of growth, body size, development and life span to temperature in the two species with contrasting diets, thus providing no support for the hypothesis of a temperature constraint on herbivory at high latitudes in O. pullus. Lastly, the processes underlying latitudinal changes in life span were investigated in the context of the oxidative stress hypothesis of ageing and of the predictions of the Metabolic Theory of Ecology, and the age-pigment neurolipofuscin was quantified in older O. pullus individuals to assess the rate of oxidative damage accumulation across latitudes. Neurolipofuscin accumulation rate increased with temperature, indicating that a slower rate of ageing contributed to greater life expectancies at colder temperatures</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sports scheduling: an artificial intelligence approach</field><field name="creator">Uthus, David C.</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP) from  the sports scheduling literature. It presents two approaches to this  problem: a metaheuristic Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) approach  to  nd good solutions in a reasonable time frame and a heuristic search  Iterative-Deepening-A* (IDA*) approach to  nd optimal solutions.  The  rst approach combines ACO with constraint processing techniques  in order to handle the hard constraints of the TTP. The key  component is creating a framework which uses forward-checking and  con ict-directed backjumping to handle the constraints while using  ACO for choosing the values. This is further improved by introducing  new ideas of unsafe backjumping and pattern matching for constraint  propagation while incorporating an old concept of ant restarts. This  approach has been found to improve on past ACO approaches to the  TTP and showed results which are more competitive with state-of-theart  metaheuristic approaches.  The second approach presents a parallel version of IDA*, combining  past concepts of tree decomposition and node ordering with a new idea  of subtree skipping. This new idea allows for parts of the search tree to  be skipped for some iterations while still guaranteeing optimality for the   nal solution that is found. Two additional ideas are presented. The   rst, called forced deepening, helps to reduce node expansion when  applying IDA*-like algorithms on real-world distance problems. The  second, called elite paths, helps to both improve the performance of  forced deepening while also allowing for the optimal solution to be  found faster during the  nal iteration of IDA*. The results of applying  this new approach to the TTP shows that it is state-of-the-art,  nding  known optimal solutions in a fraction of the time of past approaches  and  nding new optimal solutions to some unsolved problem instances.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterisation and application of micro/nano structure conducting polymers</field><field name="creator">Sui, Jing</field><field name="description">Conducting polymer micro/nanostructures have recently received great attention because of their long conjugation length, high surface area and promising applications in a variety of fields. At the same time, fabrication of micro/nanostructures of conducting polymers with controlled morphology and size remains a challenge for Chemists and Materials Scientists. The focus of this thesis, therefore, is to develop novel conducting polymer micro/nanostructures with a well defined morphology and to consider their potential for applications as sensor and actuating elements. In each case, the structure, conductivity and electrochemical properties of the conducting polymer nanostructures have been characterized using FTIR, Raman, UV-vis, XPS and elemental analyses, conductivity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Hollow nanospheres of substituted polyanilines (PANI) were fabricated chemically using ammonium persulfate as the oxidant in the presence of a polymeric acid poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid) (PMVEA). The effects of chemical reaction conditions, including the weight ratio of monomer to PMVEA, concentration of monomer, the molar ratio of monomer to oxidant, the reaction temperature and the type of the monomer, on the formation of hollow nanospheres were systematically studied. The weight fraction of PMVEA to monomer is particularly important for determining the size and uniform shape of the substituted PANI hollow spheres. The formation mechanism for the hollow nanospheres was studied in detail for the case of poly (o-methoxyaniline). The hollow nanospheres were used to construct a simple electrochemical oligonucleotide (ODN) sensor, where ODN probes were covalently grafted onto the residual carboxylic acid functionalities of the hollow nanospheres. Abstract II Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) hollow microspheres ranging from 0.5 to 10 &#956;m in diameter were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerisation of EDOT using ammonium persulfate in a catanionic surfactant solution, obtained by mixing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS). The effects of chemical reaction conditions, including the molar ratio of CTAB to SDBS, the concentration of total surfactants, the type of oxidant and magnetic stirring, on the formation of the PEDOT hollow microspheres were investigated systematically. The formation of PEDOT hollow spheres is presented as following a vesicle-templating mechanism, supported by Freeze Fracture TEM results. Moreover, the PEDOT hollow spheres showed a more effective electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of ascorbic acid, compared to conventional PEDOT granular particles, which were also effective in lowering the ascorbic acid oxidation overpotential. By extending vesicle-template method into the electropolymerisation of polypyrrole (PPy) films with para-toluene sulfonate (pTS) as the main dopant, a novel micro ring structured surface morphology was prepared by using CTAB/SDBS vesicles as templates. Spectroscopic characterisations confirmed that the micro ring structured PPy/pTS films showed similar molecular structure and doping degree to conventional PPy/pTS films, while the incorporation of some DBS anions had a minor effect on lowering film conductivity. The actuation behaviour of micro ring structured PPy/pTS films was investigated under electrochemical stimulation. The micro ring structured PPy/pTS films showed superior actuation stability compared to conventional PPy/pTS films.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics of sediment entrainment</field><field name="creator">Dwivedi, Ambuj</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The  archaeological potential of informal lithic technologies: a case study of assemblage variability in western New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Douglass, Matthew J.</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the research potential of informal lithic technologies through a case study of surface deposits from western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The defining characteristic of the lithic remains of the region is a dearth of formalized patterning. As a consequence, researchers have historically equated these remains with a casual approach to lithic technology where it is often assumed that artefacts were produced on an as needed basis. This apparent simplicity is in marked contrast to the demanding environment of the region. Water and food resources are extremely limited and historic observations indicate that Aborigional populations coped with these conditions by employing strategies of land use based on short-term occupations and high mobility. It is therefore an anomaly that populations living under such conditions would be so unconcerned with the organization of their technology. An exploration of this anomaly guides the research presented in this thesis. Was the organization of Aboriginal lithic technology truly simple or instead is the perception of simplicity an artefact of previous interpretation? The goals of this thesis go beyond questioning the perception of simplicity to the larger question of how informal technologies can be used to understand past behavioural organization. To investigate these questions, this thesis makes use of an abundance of assemblage data gathered by the Western NSW Archaeological Programme. The results of this research indicate that while the vast surface record of the region may present what appears to be a largely undifferentiated record, contextualization shows that Aboriginal occupation of the region was anything but uniform. Chronologies developed through extensive radiocarbon dating demonstrate that periods of increased II aridity are correlated with decreased evidence of Aboriginal occupation, thus suggesting territorial reorganization in the face of environmental deterioration. The study of lithic technological organization and the curation concept provide a theoretical perspective with which to explore the possibility for similar dynamism in the largely informal lithic technologies of the study region. While current studies of stone artefact curation are largely based on retouched tools, the curation process may exist in the absence of retouch. A methodology based on the quantification of cortical surface area is presented as one means through which curation without retouch may be explored. This methodology is based on the principles of solid geometry and enables comparison between the quantities of cortex observed in lithic assemblages and that which should be present given the size and shape of the stone nodules from which artefacts were produced. Deviations between observed and expected values indicate the effects of artefact transport on assemblage formation. Application of the cortex methodology indicates that cortex is extensively underrepresented in the NSW assemblages, meaning artefacts were transported away from their place of production. This result is in marked contrast to the perception of Aboriginal technological expedience. Further investigation of the cortex methodology, the development of refined techniques and the completion of additional fieldwork enabled a more in-depth test of the initial result. Viewed from a variety of perspectives, further study supports the initial interpretation. Utilizing spatial patterning in assemblage cortex proportions, the data for this study are then used to investigate the scale of Aboriginal mobility. Interpretation of this patterning provides insights into the organization of land use at a landscape scale and thus demonstrates a greater appreciation of the potential for informal lithic technologies to inform on the organization of the past.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5865</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure of the Broadlands-Ohaaki geothermal field (New Zealand) based on interpretation of seismic and gravity data</field><field name="creator">Henrys, S.(Stuart)</field><field name="description">The structure of the Broadlands-Ohaaki hot water geothermal field has been studied by analysis of seismic and gravity data. The 1984 seismic survey provided 26 km of multifold (12-fold) reflection data and refraction data (up to 1 km) along 6 profiles in the vicinity of the geothermal field. Test data were acquired along 2 profiles of 1 km length and included a walk-away noise spread. An attempt was also made to record shear-waves (SV) along one profile with in-line horizontal geophones. Processing of reflection data indicated the importance of static corrections, velocity filtering and spectral balancing of the trace amplitude spectrum before deconvolution. Delay times from the analysis of refracted (first) arrivals outline areas of anomalous low velocity that coincide with areas of highest surface temperatures (&gt;50&#176;C at 15 m depth). Ray trace modelling of travel times near the Ohaaki Pool delineate an anomalously low-velocity zone to a depth of 200 m. The frequency and amplitude of the recorded signals near the Ohaaki Pool are attenuated in comparison to field records from outside areas with high surface temperatures. Converted shear-waves indicate that Poisson's ratio is low (0.17 to 0.20) in this area. These effects are consistent with a steam/water zone occurring close to the surface Common-mid-point derived velocities and ray-tracing inversion of reflecting horizons were used to determine the 3-dimensional velocity distribution beneath the geothermal field. A low-velocity zone, in which velocities are 10-20% lower inside the geothermal field, coincides with the region of highest signal attenuation (Q&lt;20), the productive borefield, and the region of highest fluid temperature (&gt;250&#176;C at 1000 m depth) The seismic stratigraphy of the volcanic units was established using drill hole data and synthetic seismograms. The top and bottom of the Ohaaki Rhyolite and Broadlands Dacite account for the major reflecting horizons with occasional less strong reflections from the top of the Rangitaiki Ignimbrite. However, even strong reflectors are not coherent across any single section and the top of the rhyolite and dacite flows may show up with strong reflections at one part of the profile, but elsewhere with weak or no reflections. The limited success in enhancing signal quality below 500-700 m depth is attributed to a combination of noise generated in the 1ow velocity surface layer and the complexity of the geological structure at depth. Analysis of noise characteristics of the Broadlands-Ohaaki reflection data included computation of synthetic seismograms and spectral analysis of recorded seismograms. Theoretical modelling of near-surface structures showed that prominent low-frequency noise trains observed in field data are due to waves trapped in the surface layer that are excited by direct waves from shallow (5-10 m) shots. A very rapid increase in seismic wavespeed occurs at the water table and causes the surface layer to act as a waveguide which traps low-frequency Rayleigh waves and air-coupled Rayleigh waves visible on near offset traces. Compressional energy is also efficiently converted into shear-waves (SV) and is dominant as reverberating reflected refracted energy at far offsets (&gt;400 m). In addition, there is resonant coupling between the surface waves and multiple reflections. Surface-consistent spectral analysis indicates that variation in receiver response is a function of the thickness of the low-velocity layer. Reinterpretation of refraction data (1968 survey) by ray-trace modelling elucidated new structural and stratigraphic details which tie in with well data and confirms the velocity structure established from reflection data. Near offset refracted arrivals clearly define the top of the Ohaaki Rhyolite (2200-2800 m/sec) in the western part of the field and the top of the Broadlands Dacite (2650-3200 m/sec) in the east. Longer offset (&gt;3 km) travel times could be modelled as arrivals from the top of the Rautawiri Breccia and Rangitaiki Ignimbrite (velocities between 2800 m/sec and 3800 m/sec). Arrivals from greywacke basement (4500 m/sec) could only be detected in the east outside the geothermal field coming from depths less than 1.0 km. A 3-dimensional interpretation of residual gravity anomalies was also attempted since the seismic sections and detailed well data provide strong constraints. Isodensity and isoporosity contours of the Rautawiri Breccia, Waiora Formation and the Ohaaki Rhyolite reveal areas of high density and 1ow porosity corresponding to the productive regions of the borefield. This density increase is caused by alteration and mineralisation. The detailed interpretation models allow the construction of basement contour and isopach maps. Basement structural-contours show that the basement surface is very complex with significant vertical displacement along a series of predominantly northwest-southeast trending normal faults of limited horizontal extent and with no evidence of significant cross faulting. The basement reaches a maximum depth of 2300 m b.s.l west of the geothermal field. East of the geothermal field the basement rises along a series of northeast-southwest trending normal faults including the Kaingaroa Fault. Isopachs of the producive Rautawiri Breccia and Waiora Formation indicate that the thickest sequence of these units lies to the north and south of the geothermal field apart from at least two structurally controlled depressions inside the field where the thickness of the Rautawiri Breccia is greater than 500 m. Elsewhere, the combined total thickness of these units is less than 400 m. The Broadlands Dacite dome extends over an area of about 16 km2. A magnetic high associated with the Broadlands Dacite is caused by the unaltered, normally magnetised dacite east of the resistivity boundary. Isopachs of the Ohaaki Rhyolite indicate that its thickness increases to the northwest. This finding cannot be reconciled with an earlier concept of a localised Ohaaki dome structure which required a localised feeder dyke within the field. The Ohaaki Rhyolite is probably part of a more extensive chain of rhyolites outcropping to the north and west.</field><field name="date">1987</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of statistical analysis techniques for developing bedforms recorded in 3D</field><field name="creator">Friedrich, Heide</field><field name="description">This study investigated the development of bedforms from a flattened sand bed to  equilibrium conditions in laboratory flumes. Experiments were undertaken in two  flumes at The University of Auckland, a narrow 11.9-m-long, 0.38-m-deep and 0.44-mwide  glass-sided open-channel flume and a wide 45-m-long, 1.2-m-deep and 1.5-mwide  glass-sided open-channel flume.

Flow velocities  ranging from 0.35-m/s to 0.81-m/s and water depths between 0.15-m and 0.52-m were  used.

The acoustic sensors were arranged in a grid structure,  covering the centre 40% of the flume width for the narrow flume and 90% of the flume  width for the wide flume. A motorised carriage traversed the grid over a distance of  6.25-m for the narrow flume and 18.5-m for the wide flume, enabling 3D sand-bed  elevation measurements every 1-min, and 2-min respectively, resulting in quasi-4D  bedform development records.  Moving sensor measurements (47 experiments all together) were used until the  bedforms were fully developed, ranging from 2.5-hrs up to 7.5-hrs for individual flow  conditions. Recorded data post-processing techniques and general bedform development  observations are presented.  Continuous analysis tools are introduced, treating sand-bed elevations as a random field,  compared to the conventional discrete analysis methods. Continuous analysis tools are  applied to study topographical changes during the dune development in fine sand and  the 2D-3D dune transition for coarse sand.  Analysis of experiments showed that 3D ripples have on average a skewness value  similar to that for a normal distribution, with a slight negative trend. The average  kurtosis value also resembles that of a normal distribution. Conversely, 2D dunes  feature neutral to negative skewness as well as neutral to negative kurtosis. The skewness values show a correlation with the flow strength for dune beds. For dunes  developed in fine sand, both visual observations and analysis with the help of highorder  distribution moments, do not support the existence of a pronounced ripple bed  when dunes develop from a flattened sand bed. Fine sand dunes exhibit less steep  topographies than dunes developed under similar conditions in coarse sand.  A new approach to analyse 3D textures of sand-bed elevation fields is presented. 2D  structure function and 2D autocorrelation function analysis is successfully applied to the  recorded bedform data set obtained in the wide flume. It is shown that a significant trend  removal is important before application of the analysis technique. An ellipticity analysis  is introduced, the results defining analytically the restricting boundaries for bedform  development. For the wide flume experiments, the analytical results of the ellipticity  analysis show that either the flume walls or the flow depth act as a restricting force to  further growth of bedforms.  A flume comparison study between the narrow and the wide flume was carried out.  Individual experiments with similar flow conditions are compared in regards to bedform  development. It is shown that characteristic height and length values display similar  trends to discrete height and length values. Minor deviations in the definition of  saturation values and scaling regions can result in slight variations for the growth  parameters when applying the intersection technique, often even substantial variations.  The determination of parameters associated with characteristic height values seems to  be less susceptible to those problems than those associated with characteristic length  values. It is shown that dunes in the wide flume display larger height and length features  than dunes developed under the same flow conditions in the narrow flume. Scaling  relations are analysed and discussed. Equilibrium parameters of characteristic height  and length and their corresponding time parameters, are obtained for each experiment  and used for normalisation. It is shown that although the growth deviation across the  flume is substantial for wide flume experiments, once normalised, growth parameters  show a better agreement for all recorded dune development data. Double scaling  analysis is adversely affected by the difficult determination of temporal equilibrium  parameters.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing gender in the construction of Scottish identity, c. 1286-c. 1586</field><field name="creator">Smith, Michelle Ann</field><field name="description">Drawing on insights from gender studies, postcolonial theory, and debates around nation and identity this thesis offers a new reading of selected medieval and sixteenth-century Scottish histories and literature and focuses on the intersection of gender and Scottish identity. Historical and theoretical scholarship has shown that power and identity formation are complicit in the construction of both gender and nation, yet are usually discussed as separate entities. Moreover, theorists of nation argue the concept of &#8216;nation&#8217; is a modern construct that has no history prior to the late eighteenth century. Therefore, by ignoring the rigid periodisation given to the study of the nation and identity I demonstrate a Scottish identity existed between c. 1286 and c. 1586, one that was underpinned by gender ideologies. Scottish historians have recently acknowledged the paucity of writings on medieval and early modern Scottish national identity and culture from a gendered perspective. Using gender as a tool of historical analysis uncovers the multiple dimensions that make people and institutions what they are, giving them meaning. People and institutions are informed and guided by relationships of power and a gendered analysis provides a framework where one can examine and understand the cultural and social relationships people had with the religious and political institutions that governed them. This thesis examines foundation myths, kingship, heroes and heroines, and personifications of the land to illuminate the complexities of gender existing in the primary texts. All the chapters question the singularity of a hegemonic masculinity which was perceived as the norm and excluded women, the feminine and &#8216;other&#8217; men. By challenging traditional power relationships this thesis demonstrates that images and languages of gender helped construct and inform medieval and sixteenth-century Scottish identities. This research will provide a fresh and innovative look at gender and nation, going beyond archival facts and demonstrating that the historical literature exposes changing cultural and ideological definitions of masculinities and femininities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What can I understand about children with special needs from the musical offerings that emerge in the music therapy process? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Music Therapy at New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cammell, Shane</field><field name="description">This arts-based research thesis sought to understand two children with special needs, through their musical offerings within the context of their music therapy sessions. The process of understanding the children came through firstly listening to and extracting meaningful musical data from recordings of their sessions. This data included both actual excerpts of the musical interplays between the child and music therapist (myself), and more broadly, underlying themes drawn from the recorded session material. The data was then creatively &#8216;melded&#8217;, resulting in two original instrumental works, herein referred to as 'songs'. Before, during and after writing the songs, rigorous analyses were undertaken utilising both a formal approach, via the use of a contextual question framework, and two creative approaches: free-form narration and data-led imagery. The contextual question framework, involving the repetitive use of two key questions - where? and why? - sought to understand the data&#8217;s context, its purpose for inclusion, and its influence on the respective song. One of the creative approaches, that of free-form narration, sought to, rather than analysing the song through formal structures, instead &#8216;tell the song&#8217;s story&#8217;, narratively conveying the experience of being with the child in his music. The other creative approach, that of data-led imagery, involved creating images during and after being &#8216;immersed&#8217; in the musical data, employing instinctive or subconscious means to further develop the therapist&#8217;s understanding of the child&#8217;s musical offerings, and moreover, the child himself. Upon completion of the two songs, it was discovered that clinical themes present from the sessions strongly influenced the song creation process. Results also strongly supported the validity of arts-based research as a viable means of analysing music created with children with special needs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music therapy</field><field name="subject">special education</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410100 Performing Arts Studies::410101 Music studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A sedimentological and geochemical approach to understanding cycles of stratovolcano growth and collapse at Mt Taranaki, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Earth Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zernack, Anke Verena</field><field name="description">The long-term behaviour of andesitic stratovolcanoes is characterised by a repetition of edifice growth and collapse phases. This cyclic pattern may represent a natural frequency at varying timescales in the growth dynamics of stratovolcanoes, but is often difficult to identify because of long cycle-timescales, coupled with incomplete stratigraphic records. The volcaniclastic ring-plain succession surrounding the 2 518 m Mt. Taranaki, New Zealand, comprises a wide variety of distinctive volcanic mass-flow lithofacies with sedimentary and lithology characteristics that can be related to recurring volcanic cycles over &gt;190 ka. Debrisflow and monolithologic hyperconcentrated-flow deposits record edifice growth phases while polylithologic debris-avalanche and associated cohesive debris-flow units were emplaced by collapse. Major edifice failures at Mt. Taranaki occurred on-average every 10 ka, with five events recognised over the last 30 ka, a time interval for which stratigraphic records are more complete. The unstable nature of Mt. Taranaki mainly results from its weak internal composite structure including abundant saturated pyroclastic deposits and breccia layers, along with its growth on a weakly indurated and tectonically fractured basement of Tertiary mudstones and sandstones. As the edifice repeatedly grew beyond a critical stable height or profile, large-scale collapses were triggered by intrusions preceding magmatic activity, major eruptions, or significant regional tectonic fault movements. Clasts within debris-avalanche deposits were used as a series of windows into the composition of previous successive proto-Mt Taranaki edifices in order to examine magmatic controls on their failure. The diversity of lithologies and their geochemical characteristics are similar throughout the history of the volcano, with the oldest sample suites displaying a slightly broader range of compositions including more primitive rock types. The evolution to a narrower range and higher-silica compositions was accompanied by an increase in K2O. This shows that later melts progressively interacted with underplated amphibolitic material at the base of the crust. These gradual changes imply a long-term stability of the magmatic system. The preservation of similar internal conditions during the volcano&#8217;s evolution, hence suggests that external processes were the main driving force behind its cyclic growth and collapse behaviour and resulting sedimentation pattern.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vulcanology</field><field name="subject">Mount Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Mount Egmont</field><field name="subject">volcanoes</field><field name="subject">stratigraphic geology</field><field name="subject">geochemistry</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Backward bifurcation in SIR endemic models : this thesis is presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Information Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siddiqui, Sameeha Qaiser</field><field name="description">In the well known SIR endemic model, the infection-free steady state is globally stable for R0 &lt; 1 and unstable for R0 &gt; 1. Hence, we have a forward bifurcation when R0 = 1. When R0 &gt; 1, an asymptotically stable endemic steady state exists. The basic reproduction number R0 is the main threshold bifurcation parameter used to determine the stability of steady states of SIR endemic models. In this thesis we study extensions of the SIR endemic model for which a backward bifurcation may occur at R0 = 1. We investigate the biologically reasonable conditions for the change of stability. We also analyse the impact of di erent factors that lead to a backward bifurcation both numerically and analytically. A backward bifurcation leads to sub-critical endemic steady states and hysteresis. We also provide a general classi cation of such models, using a small amplitude expansion near the bifurcation. Additionally, we present a procedure for projecting three dimensional models onto two dimensional models by applying some linear algebraic techniques. The four extensions examined are: the SIR model with a susceptible recovered class; nonlinear transmission; exogenous infection; and with a carrier class. Numerous writers have mentioned that a nonlinear transmission function in relation to the infective class, can only lead to a system with an unstable endemic steady state. In spite of this we show that in a nonlinear transmission model, we have a function depending on the infectives and satisfying certain biological conditions, and leading to a sub-critical endemic equilibriums.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical biology</field><field name="subject">linear algebra</field><field name="subject">nonlinear transmission</field><field name="subject">exogenous infection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the relationship between aluminium treatment and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme system in Lolium perenne (L. perenne cv. Nui) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science (with Honours) in Plant Biology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Samuel James</field><field name="description">Lolium perenne cv. Nui is a cultivar of ryegrass grown throughout New Zealand in pastures due to favourable traits such as high palatability for livestock and its ability to withstand intensive grazing. However, the productivity of pastures is reduced when levels of aluminium and other metals accumulate in soils to toxic levels, a phenomenon referred to as the &#8216;acid soil syndrome&#8217;. In response to this toxicity, plants activate a series of antioxidant reactions, with one catalysed by the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymatic system. The enzyme system comprises three isoenzymes, a Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD and a MnSOD which catalyse the same reaction but differ in amino acid sequence, molecular mass and the metal ion co-factor (hence Cu/ZnSOD, FeSOD and MnSOD). Together these isoenzymes combat the damaging effect of superoxide radicals which accumulate due to metal toxicity. In this thesis, the isolation of genes encoding isoenzymes of the SOD enzyme from L. perenne cv. Nui is described. As well, the growth of L. perenne cv. Nui and changes in expression of the SOD genes encoding each isoenzyme in response to aluminium treatment (0.2mM AlCl3) is investigated. A 1072 bp FeSOD gene sequence and a 705 bp MnSOD gene sequence were isolated from shoot tissue of L. perenne cv. Nui using a combination of RT-PCR with degenerate primers and 3'-RACE. The FeSOD gene comprised 572 bp of the coding sequence and 500 bp of 3'-UTR while the MnSOD gene comprised 508 bp of coding sequence and a 197 bp 3'-UTR. By alignment of each sequence with the gene from the database with highest identity it was predicted that the translation start codon (ATG) is located a further 196 bp upstream for the FeSOD gene (aligned with an Oryza sativa FeSOD sequence as a reference) and a further 152 bp upstream for the MnSOD sequence (aligned with a Triticum aestivum MnSOD sequence as a reference). Using RT-PCR with degenerate primers, a 313 bp CuSOD sequence was predominantly cloned from shoot tissue of L. perenne cv. Nui, but it was not possible to generate the 3'-UTR using 3'-RACE. For growth analysis, seedlings of L. perenne cv. Nui were germinated and acclimatised in Hoagland&#8217;s solution, and then subjected to either aluminium treatment (0.2mM  AlCl3) or no treatment to act as a control over a designated time course of 0, 4, 8, or 24 hours. Two growth trials were conducted that differed in the age of seedlings used and plant tissues were separated into root and shoot tissues. Similar growth trends were observed in both trials, but the sampling regime in the second growth trial meant that statistical analysis could be carried out. In this trial, analysis revealed that over a time course of 24 hours exposure to 0.2mM aluminium, both root and shoot tissue fresh weight did not significantly differ when compared to the control (no aluminium). A general trend of an increase in root and shoot fresh weight was observed in plants treated with aluminium, but this trend was not significant at P=0.05. No significant change in fresh weight partitioning from shoot to root, or root to shoot in response to aluminium was also observed. Using semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (sqRTPCR) and primers based around the 3'-UTR with RNA isolated from plants grown in the second hydroponic trial, it was determined that under the conditions used, expression of the FeSOD and MnSOD genes isolated in this study were neither up-regulated or downregulated in response to aluminium treatment in both shoot and root tissue. Further, using degenerate primers to detect expression of one or more genes encoding the Cu/ZnSOD isoenzyme, total expression of the Cu/ZnSOD isoenzyme was also unresponsive to aluminium treatment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">acid soil syndrome</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taupaenui : Maori positive ageing : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edwards, William John Werahiko</field><field name="description">The global phenomenon of population ageing has major ramifications for societies and governments around the world. In New Zealand, efforts to address the impacts of population ageing have centred on the Government&#8217;s Positive Ageing Strategy. This is a thesis about positive ageing as viewed through Maori eyes. It has been informed by the memories and aspirations of older Maori who have lived through challenging times but have emerged with qualities that enable them to enjoy older age and to contribute to their own whanau, Te Ao Maori (the Maori world) and Te Ao Whanui (wider society). The thesis is philosophically located at the interface between Western science and matauranga Maori, an Indigenous inquiry paradigm. It is argued that Western science and matauranga Maori are relevant to research in the contemporary context, and reflect the realities of older Maori who live in both Te Ao Maori and Te Ao Whanui. The study used research techniques that draw on Western science (literature review), matauranga Maori (review of 42 Maori proverbs) and both inquiry paradigms simultaneously (qualitative study with 20 older Maori people). The research found that Maori positive ageing can be characterised by a two dimensional concept that incorporates a process dimension and an outcome dimension. The process dimension is consistent with a lifecourse perspective and therefore recognises that ageing is a life-long process where circumstances encountered during life may impact cumulatively and manifest in old age. The outcome dimension can be described in terms of complementary &#8216;universal&#8217; and Maori specific outcome domains. The universal outcome domains are encapsulated in the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy and more recently are expressed in the Positive Ageing Indicators 2007 Report. The Maori-specific outcome domains identified in this Study are: kaitiakitanga &#8211; stewardship; whanaungatanga &#8211; connectedness; taketuku &#8211; transmission; takoha &#8211; contribution; takatu &#8211; adaptability; and, tino rangatiratanga &#8211; selfdetermination.

Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of health and performance in New Zealand racehorses : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Epidemiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Perkins, Nigel Ross</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to describe training and racing patterns, and causes of wastage in New Zealand Thoroughbred racehorses. Two separate studies were performed. The first involved analysis of data from before and after construction of a new training track at the Matamata Racing Club. Comparisons of measures of performance failed to detect any adverse impact that could be attributed to the new track. The second involved a longitudinal study over a 34-month period, and that involved 1,571 horses. Duration of training preparations and spell periods were associated with horse age, and with the reason for ending a training preparation. Most horses began a training preparation doing slow work and then progressively advanced to a first start. Incidence rates were estimated for starts per 100 training-days, and other summary measures were estimated including training-days to first start, and between successive starts. A total of 834 musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) were observed, resulting in either a spell period, retirement, or death of the horse. There were 165 respiratory disease events, and 58 conditions involving other body systems. Multivariate statistical models were used to explore risk factors for different types of MSI. Older horses were at higher risk of lower limb MSI, and injury to either the superficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) or suspensory apparatus (SA), while they were at lower risk of shin soreness and other conditions. Male horses had higher risk of tendon and ligament injury than females. Lower risk of injury was observed in Autumn and Winter months compared with December, and in the 1999-2000 year relative to 1997-1998. Measures of cumulative exercise intensity showed a complex relationship with risk of injury that varied with type of injury. The risk of SDFT and SA injury was higher for those preparations without starts, while that for shin soreness was increased after the first start. For lameness conditions other than shin soreness or injury to the SDFT, the hazard was increased after the first start in a preparation, but the magnitude of effect was dependent on the number of days from the beginning of a preparation to the first start.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Racehorse performance</field><field name="subject">Racehorse training</field><field name="subject">Racehorse injuries</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome among taxi drivers : consequences and barriers to accessing health services : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Sleep/Wake Research Centre, Wellington Campus, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Tupai-Firestone, Ridvan</field><field name="description">Irregular pagination - jumps from p. 168 to p. 170.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep disorders</field><field name="subject">Health care access</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields on human chromosomes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics at the Institute of Molecular BioSciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Wahab, Mohammed Abdul</field><field name="description">Electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been associated with increased incidences of cancer as suggested by epidemiological studies. The in vitro sister chromatid exchange (SCE) technique, radiation-induced micronucleus assay (MN assay), COMET assay, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used in the present study to test the carcinogenic potentiality of extremely low frequency (ELF) EMFs on human peripheral blood lymphocytes. All experiments were performed single blind and used lymphocytes taken from 6 age-matched donors. The SCE experiments were conducted twice: round 1 (R1) and round 2 (R2), in order to determine whether or not the results obtained could be duplicated. Detailed analysis of the SCE results showed that there was a significant increase in the number of SCEs/cell in the grouped experimental conditions compared to the controls in both rounds. Similarly, in the MN assay, a significant increase of mean number of micronucleated CB cells/100 CB cells (Ma) and mean number of micronuclei/100 CB cells (Mb) was observed in the grouped experimental conditions compared to the controls. Moreover, the highest SCE frequency in R1 was 10.03 for a square continuous field, and the SCE frequency of 10.39 for a square continuous field in R2 (albeit a different strength) was the second highest in this latter round. But in the MN assay a square pulsed field with increasing EMF strength showed the greatest effect on the DNA repair system. The COMET assay also showed that both a l m T square field (continuous or pulsed) resulted in significant fragmentation of the DNA. On the other hand, a FISH analysis failed to show any translocations. In the field of EMF research, perhaps the most outstanding question that remains to be answered with certainty is how weak EMFs exert their effects at the molecular level. Various mechanisms are reviewed and evaluated in this thesis. From the results of the research performed in the current study which concentrated on testing and discovering genetic effects, a model is postulated that weak EMFs stimulate the production of free radicals which result in genetic damage. Further extensive research should be conducted to test this hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electromagnetic fields and cancer</field><field name="subject">Effects of electromagnetic fields</field><field name="subject">Genetic damage</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Berry fruit anthocyanins in human nutrition : bioavailability and antioxidant effects : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nutritional Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Walton, Michaela C.</field><field name="description">Anthocyanins (ACNs), which are responsible for the red and blue colours displayed by many vegetables and fruits (particularly berries), belong to secondary plant metabolites, and are a component of our daily diet. There is an increasing interest on their biological activities as they are claimed to enhance health by protecting against some chronic diseases. However, before ACNs can perform health-promoting effects in vivo, they must first be sufficiently absorbed, distributed within the human body, and reach target tissues in adequate concentrations. To date, all studies investigating ACN absorption and metabolism came to the conclusion that their bioavailability is extremely low. To benefit from the proposed health effects of ACNs, their bioavailability, including absorption, metabolism, and excretion must first be understood. The main objective of this thesis was to provide further knowledge on ACN absorption, including the absorption site and mechanism, and the influence of food and other flavonoids on ACN absorption, as well as the investigation of their antioxidant effects in vivo. In vitro experiments using Ussing chambers showed that a strong absorption of ACNs occurred from the jejunum in mice. This was supported with a further in vivo study, where the major absorption site for ACNs may be the jejunum in rats. The limitation of ACN absorption to mainly one part of the intestine suggested the participation of a particular transport mechanism. In a further Ussing chamber study it was shown that flavonols, another common flavonoid group present in many fruits and vegetables, strongly inhibit ACN absorption, indicating a specific transport mechanism, with preference for other flavonoid compounds. Further in vivo studies have shown that the simultaneous ingestion of food components, such as breakfast cereals, resulted in a delayed absorption profile in two animal species. However, the additional food did not influence the antioxidant effect of ACNs. During a human intervention study, several measures of oxidative stress improved, but this improvement occurred equally in the treatments and placebo control, and may have resulted from changes in lifestyle. The results of these studies aid to understand details of ACN absorption and help to formulate future recommendations for ACN intake with increased bioavailability in humans.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ACN absorption</field><field name="subject">Bioavailability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural &amp; functional characterization of 3-Deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase from Helicobacter pylori &amp; Mycobacterium tuberculosis : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Biochemistry at Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Webby, Celia Jane</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restrictions:  Webby, C.J., Patchett, M.L. &amp; Parker, E.J.

It is an investigation of the 'mobile and transitory' discourses at play in instances of resistance between parents, physicians and nurses within health care institutions, and an examination of the consequences of resistance through providing alternative ways of perceiving and therefore understanding these disagreements. The philosophical perspectives, methodology and methods used in this thesis are underpinned by selected ideas taken from the works of Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu and supported by relevant literature in the fields of media, law, children, parenting, caring, serious childhood illness, medicine and nursing. The thesis obtains information from a variety of texts that includes established literature (such as medical, sociological, legal, academic and philosophical), newspaper articles, radio or television interviews, internet sources, court reports and proceedings, legal experts and other commentators - and 15 interview based texts, where the focus is on analyses of narratives of parents, doctors and nurses. In the texts gathered for this thesis, there are noticeable differences between the personal experience discourses of parents, the 'in-between' discourses of nurses, and the disciplined discourses of physicians. This thesis brings these discourses into conversation with each other suggesting that parental resistance does not occur because of an infrequent and unusual set of circumstances where a few socially isolated and/or 'difficult' parents disagree with the treatment desires of paediatric physicians. Instead, it is argued that from an examination of interview based texts, parental resistance is an omnipresent but transitory occurrence that affects many of the interactions between the parents of seriously ill children and clinical staff. It is maintained that within these interactions, the seeds of this resistance are sown in both critical decision making situations and in everyday occurrences between doctors, nurses and parents within healthcare institutions. Contributing factors to parental resistance include the use of power games by staff, the language of medicine, forms of symbolic violence, the presence or absence of trust between parents and medical staff, the effects of medical habitus, and challenges to the parental role and identity. Overall, it is proposed in this thesis that parents who resist treatment for their seriously ill child are not exceptions to the normative patient-physician relationship. Instead an analysis of their discourses and practices is able to illuminate the complex interactions between patients and medical conventions. It is therefore possible to see parents who resist medical advice not as peripheral to the medical encounter but as examples of how patient-physician relationships come to be codified, constructed and crafted through everyday discourses and practices within health care settings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parent/medical staff interaction</field><field name="subject">Parent attitudes</field><field name="subject">Child healthcare</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321299 Public health and health services not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feed particle size, whole wheat inclusion and xylanase supplementation in broiler diets : influence on the performance, digesta characteristics and digestive tract development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Poultry Nutrition at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Amerah, Ahmed M.</field><field name="description">The first three experiments of this thesis examined the effects of particle size reduction of grains in relation to feed form (mash vs. pellet), grain type (wheat vs. maize) and xylanase supplementation on broiler performance, energy utilisation, digestive tract development and digesta parameters. The fourth experiment examined the interaction between wheat hardness and xylanase supplementation. The effects of insoluble fibre source and whole wheat inclusion were studied in the fifth experiment. In the first experiment (Chapter 4), pelleting reduced nitrogen-corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn), but broiler performance was superior in birds fed pelleted wheat-based diets compared to those fed mash diets. Feed form had a greater effect on various measured parameters than did particle size. Pelleting evened out differences in particle size distribution between treatments and, as a result, wheat particle size had no effect on the performance of broilers fed pelleted diets. In contrast, the second experiment (Chapter 5) showed that differences in particle size distribution persisted between diets after pelleting and, as a result, coarse grinding of wheat or maize improved broiler performance compared to those fed diets based on fine particles. These results may be related, in part, to changes in size distribution following pelleting. In mash diets, inconsistency in performance reponses were found. In the first experiment (Chapter 4), coarse grinding of wheat improved weight gain and feed per gain compared to medium grinding. In the third experiment (Chapter 6), however, grinding particle size had no influence on broiler performance. The observed discrepancy suggests involvement of other factors such as wheat cultivar and grain hardness. Data reported in Chapter 6 showed that xylanase supplementation improved feed per gain of birds fed the coarse particle size diet, but had no effect on those fed the medium particle size diet. In Chapter 7, there was a significant interaction between wheat hardness and xylanase supplementation due to the improved feed per gain and AMEn of birds maintained on hard wheat-based diet, while there was no effect of xylanase on sort wheat-based diet. These findings suggest that the efficiency of exogenous enzymes is influenced by both particle size and wheat hardness. Data reported in Chapter 7 showed that inclusion of soft or hard whole wheat pre-pelleting produced different particle size distributions in the pelleted diets. This suggested that hardness of the grain must be considered when choosing whole wheat for inclusion in broiler diets. Data on the effect of feed particle size on its subsequent distribution in poultry digesta are scanty. Results reported in Chapters 4 and 5 showed that there was no effect of feed particle size within feed form on duodenal digesta particle size. On the other hand, particle size of duodenal digesta was influenced by feed form (mash vs. pellet). Wheat hardness was also found to influence the particle size of proximal (duodenum and jejunum) intestinal digesta (Chapter 7). These results indicated that the gizzard does not uniformly reduce the size of all particles. However, the gizzard appears highly efficient in grinding large particles, although some large particles escape the grinding. The final experiment demonstrated that the effects of insoluble fibre on digestive tract development and broiler performance differed depending on the fibre source. Wood shavings, a source of coarse insoluble fibre, increased relative gizzard size and improved corrected feed per gain and ileal starch digestibility. In contrast, cellulose, a source of fine insoluble fibre, had no influence on these parameters. In conclusion, dietary manipulations, which stimulated gizzard development, positively influenced broiler performance and starch digestibility. The findings of this thesis suggest that energy savings during feed processing could be achieved by coarse grinding of grains with no adverse effect on broiler performance and that cereals used in broiler diets can be ground more coarsely than the current practice. Wheat hardness appears to be an important criterion to consider when choosing a cultivar for whole wheat inclusion in broiler diets. Another major finding was that the effectiveness of exogenous xylanase in wheat-based diets could be improved by considering factors such as particle size and wheat hardness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poultry feed</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations on growth and P uptake characteristics of maize and sweet corn as influenced by soil P status : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) (Plant &amp; soil science), Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Aslam, Tehseen</field><field name="description">Despite being different cultivars of the same plant species (Zea mays L.), maize and sweet corn have contrasting P fertiliser recommendations in New Zealand, that are reflected in different target Olsen P values of 10-15 mg P/kg soil for optimum maize growth and 26-35 mg P/kg soil for optimum sweet corn growth. Three key hypotheses were developed in this study to explain why these differences may exist: i) maize and sweet corn differ in their responsiveness to P fertiliser i.e. maize is more internally P efficient and requires less P than sweet corn to grow, ii) both cultivars differ in external P efficiency i.e. their ability to take P up from soil iii) both cultivars differ in external P efficiency because they have different root system structure. Two field experiments evaluated the growth and yield responses of maize and sweet to different rates of P fertiliser application. The first experiment was conducted in Hawke's Bay (2001-02) and second in the Manawatu (2002-03) with P application rates of 0, 100 and 200 kg P/ha in the Hawke's Bay and 0, 15 and 70 kg P/ha in the Manawatu. Both experiments were conducted on soils of low available P status. The Olsen P test values of 13 mg P/kg soil in the Hawke's Bay and 11 mg P/kg soil in the Manawatu were far below the recommended values for sweet corn (25-35 mg P/kg soil). In both experiments and across all P treatments maize produced significantly higher dry matter yields than sweet corn during all sampling stages. In the Hawke's Bay experiment at 100 days after sowing (DAS), the maize (87719 plants/ha, 20.9 t/ha) produced 43% more dry matter than sweet corn (71124 plants/ha, 14.6 t/ha), whereas, in the Manawatu experiment (140 DAS), maize (71124 plants/ha, 15.2 t/ha) had a 39% higher dry matter yield than sweet corn (71124 plants/ha, 10.9 t/ha). In both the field experiments, the sweet corn fresh cob yield of 27 and 28 t/ha in the Hawke's Bay and the Manawatu regions and maize grain yields of 16 and 10 t/ha, respectively, were within the range of the reported commercial yields for each region. In both experiments, the P fertiliser application raised the soil P status (Olsen P test values) but caused no significant increases in either maize or sweet corn yields (total dry matter, sweet corn fresh cob or maize grain). Commercially viable yields of both cultivars were able to be achieved without P fertiliser application with Olsen P soil test in the range of 10-15 mg P/kg soil. Sweet corn reached harvestable maturity at 115 DAS in the Hawke's Bay and 140 DAS in the Manawatu experiments. By this time maize had produced 4-6 t/ha more total dry matter yield than sweet corn, yet maize and sweet corn had achieved similar total P uptake (32-37 kg P/ha at 100 DAS in the Hawke's Bay and 18-19 kg P/ha at 140 DAS in the Manawatu). At silking (after 75 DAS in the Hawke's Bay and approximately 110 DAS in the Manawatu), both cultivar's total leaf P concentrations (0.21-0.25%) were within the sufficiency range values for maize crops in New Zealand (0.18-0.33 %). Maize, however was more internally P efficient growing more dry matter per unit P taken up, which was more noticeable in the drier season. Fertiliser P application increased P uptake with both cultivars under moist conditions in the Hawke's Bay experiment (2001-02). However, the dry conditions in the Manawatu (2002-03) limited P uptake as well as restricted dry matter yields with both cultivars. Further, there were no significant differences between maize and sweet corn P uptake efficiency (kg P/kg root) despite significant differences in the root system structure (biomass) for both cultivars at all stages, which lead to different temporal patterns of P uptake. The lack of maize yield response to fertiliser P in both field experiments is consistent with the New Zealand recommendations for growing a maize grain crop (because soil Olsen P was in the range of 10-15 mg P/kg). However, the lack of sweet corn yield response in both field experiments does not support the New Zealand recommendations for growing sweet corn (which assume optimal Olsen P values are 26-35 mg P/kg).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">P fertiliser</field><field name="subject">Manawatu</field><field name="subject">Hawkes Bay</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300200 Crop and Pasture Production::300202 Plant nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying genetic variation in environmental sensitivity of New Zealand dairy cattle to apply in the development of a dairy cattle simulation model for pastoral systems : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Jeremy</field><field name="description">The objectives of this research were firstly, to investigate if dairy cattle genotypes in NZ exhibit genetic variation in environmental sensitivity and to determine if this genetic variation is statistically significant from a genetic evaluation perspective, and secondly, to use genetic information including environmental sensitivity data to simulate dairy cattle responses to changes in nutritional regime and variation in climate. A comprehensive review identified that simulation models either overlook, or do not represent environmental sensitivity information where genotypes and breeds respond differently when exposed to variations in environment. A large dataset of daily and total lactation records (yields of milk, fat and protein) from herds participating in the progeny testing of sires from 1989 to 2002 was obtained to test for differences in the environmental sensitivity of dairy cattle in New Zealand. Production data was matched with environmental data relating to climate, herd size, altitude and herd average production levels (a proxy for feeding level). The statistical analyses applying univariate and bivariate multibreed models to environmental character states identified minimal sire re-ranking between environmental character states as measured by genetic and rank correlations. However, differences in yields of milk, fat and protein between New Zealand Jersey and overseas Holstein Friesian systematically diverged with production level, in herds expected to use different levels of supplements. These results suggest New Zealand Jersey cattle are best suited to a grassland-type environment, and overseas Holstein Friesian cattle are more suited to an intensive-type environment. A phenotypic analysis identified thermal environment (cold and hot conditions) significantly affected the expression of production traits in Holstein Friesian, New Zealand Jersey and Holstein Friesian x New Zealand Jersey cattle. Holstein Friesian dairy cattle were more susceptible to the effects of heat conditions than New Zealand Jersey cattle with yields of milk, and concentrations of fat and protein of the former compromised at a lower value for temperature humidity index. Dairy cattle performance is likely to be compromised by heat more frequently than cold conditions in New Zealand. A simulation model that considers how dairy cow genotypes respond to different environments, incorporating the results presented above, was then developed. An initial estimate of feed intake is used to define cow genetic potential based on estimated breeding values for total yields milk, fat and protein, and environmental sensitivity information. A mammary gland module then predicts daily yields of milk, fat and protein based on the cow's genetic potential after considering her age, stage of lactation, body condition score, nutritional status and thermal environment. Live weight change is also predicted via a body energy stores module, which considers the effect of age, stage of lactation, current body condition score, nutritional status, and an estimated breeding value for body condition score. Feed intake is predicted from the requirements for maintenance, growth and pregnancy, and the genetic drive for yields of milk, fat and protein and body fat change. The predictive ability of the model was tested using information from a prior study with two Holstein Friesian genotypes managed in a pasture-based system. The model simulated to a high degree of accuracy, mean values for yields of milk, fat and protein, and concentrations of fat and protein of each genotype. Various tests identified the major source of error between simulated and observed values were due to a lack of simulated variation. In conclusion, the extent of genetic variation in environmental sensitivity for total lactation yields of milk, fat and protein within the range of New Zealand environments are not sufficient to warrant the formation of separate breeding schemes for distinct environments. However, New Zealand Jersey cattle are best suited to a grassland-type environment, and overseas Holstein Friesian cattle are more suited to an intensive-type environment. Genetic variation in the suitability of different breeds for specific environments existed within breeds. A simulation model was developed that was able to simulate the effect of genotype, environment and genotypic differences in environmental sensitivity on daily cow performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dairy cattle genetics</field><field name="subject">Dairy cattle breed differences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of Campylobacter jejuni in commercial broiler flocks in New Zealand : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Boxall, Naomi</field><field name="description">Irregular pagination: jumps from xix to 21</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poultry diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For the common good : the Catholic educational mission in transition, 1943-1965 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Collins, Jenny</field><field name="description">Irregular pagination: p. 462 omitted.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic schools</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::339900 Other Education::339999 Other education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For the boys: a qualitative study of women's gender strategies and emotional labour in professional boxing</field><field name="creator">Yvonne Lafferty</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Saving soldiers the evolution of international military medical norms, 1815 to 1914</field><field name="creator">Jessica Jane Ellis</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Competitive Interactions in a Tropical Marine Epifaunal Community</field><field name="creator">Erin O'Leary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">interspecific competition, overgrowth, ascidians, sponges, bryozoans, One Tree Reef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanised Intercropping and Double Cropping in Southern Queensland</field><field name="creator">Peter Michael Masasso</field><field name="description">The potential for relay intercropping and double cropping was assessed in field trials over three consecutive years at Gatton, Queensland. The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiology of the PNSB Genus Rhodobacter: Volatile Fatty Acid Metabolism and Global Metabolic Regulation</field><field name="creator">Miss Jessica Welch</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">2-Iodoxybenzoic Acid: Acidity Investigations and The Total Synthesis of 5,14-bis-epi-Spirovibsanin A</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Gallen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ibx, acidity, pka, oxidation, spirovibsanin a, diterpene, total synthesis, natural product, spirolactone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microbial ecology of equine laminitis of alimentary origin</field><field name="creator">Milinovich, Gabriel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equine, laminitis, hindgut, microbiology, microbial ecology, Streptococcus, oligofructose.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paradox of Identity Security and Recourse to Violence in Liberal Democracy</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Bryn Wagner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Security, liberal democracy, identity, political violence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of N-qubit chains</field><field name="creator">Mr Courtney Mewton</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bifurcations, Phase Transitions and Teleportation in Entangled Quantum Systems</field><field name="creator">John Paul Barjaktarevic</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictions and perspectives: Exploring the relationship between psychological well-being and substance use by young males and females.</field><field name="creator">Ms Kim Johnston</field><field name="description">Adolescence is a time of experimentation and exploration. For many young people, a feature of this developmental period is the initiation of substance use. Whilst the majority of young people do not go on to develop substance use problems, any substance use has potential for danger. The current body of literature on the prevention of substance use problems suggests that in order to advance understanding, researchers must adopt a risk-focused approach. There is a wide range of indices that have been cited as risk factors for the development of substance use disorders. Chapter 2 explores some of the aetiological models and literature on risk factors with specific reference to psychological wellbeing, studies highlighting comorbid relationships between adolescent mental health and substance use problems, and the functional value of substances in relation to well-being. Although attention to psychological risk factors has received increased press in the literature, the number of controlled, longitudinal studies is relatively small. A review of recent studies (Chapter 3) indicates that the presence of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem or behavioural problems such as delinquency represent psychological risk factors for the development of later substance use problems, however findings are inconsistent and many studies do not examine differential predictive utility by substance or gender. Thus, Study 1 of this research aimed to add to this body of work by exploring the prediction of alcohol, cannabis and other illicit substance use at age fifteen from key indicators of psychological well-being taken at age thirteen. The data from a normative sample of high school students indicated subtle differences in trajectory for young males and females and effects specific to different drug categories. Delinquency emerged as the most consistent predictor in both males and females. Low self-esteem was also an important indicator for future female marijuana use and marijuana intoxication and both male and female other illicit substance use. The findings highlighted the need for a greater contextual understanding of the relationship between delinquency, self-esteem and substance use. The second study sought to provide a deeper understanding of these issues by examining the perceived functional value of substances in relation to psychological wellbeing, by means of a qualitative study of a group of young people who had experienced problems with their substance use. Chapter 4 explores the limited phenomenological research in this area, with a focus on studies which have used methods of measurement that highlight the perspective of young people. Using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach, Study 2 builds on the drug type and gender contrasts noted in Study 1, and explores the interface between substance use and psychological well-being in depth using a clinical population. A number of key functions are identified by young people, with evidence of both convergence and divergence across drug categories (alcohol, cannabis, other illicit substances). Interviewees reported six functions common to all substances; social connectedness, improve affect, positive self-transformation, better coping with problems, fun and laughter, and feeling intoxicated. Nine additional functions were identified in relation to cannabis and other illicit substances. Several gender differences were also noted, with males tending to report more positive reinforcement from alcohol and cannabis, and young females more frequently describing benefits related to use of other illicit substances. The concluding chapter (Chapter 5) reviews the main findings across both studies and their implications for theory, practice, and future research. Overall, the findings of the research provide support for both problem behaviour and adaptive models of adolescent substance use, and indicate that young people are capable of reflecting on their substance use experiences. Incorporating the wisdom of young people into risk frameworks may enhance prevention, education and intervention efforts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescent, substance misuse, psychological well-being, consensual qualitative research</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:161713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decolonizing Feminism</field><field name="creator">Bronwyn Wex</field><field name="description">The task of attending to cultural difference amongst women while also &#8216;bridging&#8217; these differences is deeply contested in feminism. This concern arose in response to criticisms that &#8216;hegemonic&#8217; feminism is indeed part of the colonial project. These critiques demonstrated that the notion of feminism as a universal movement for all women is deeply problematic and founded on the exclusion of sex, race, and class differences. Subsequently, the aim to recuperate a notion of the universal that refuses these exclusions is of central concern to contemporary feminism. As feminism comes to grip with the impact of globalization on women in different parts of the world, this impetus to engender understanding and alliances across cultural difference is more salient than ever. This thesis explores one response to the dilemma which I term the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217;. Only recently emerging from the field of contemporary feminist theory, this impulse and the key authors which inform it has not be examined in any substantial way. This is where the original contribution of this thesis lies. My main focus is to explore the central aim of this emerging set of ideas and to identify their strengths and weaknesses. I argue that the central aim of the decolonizing impulse is to build feminist alliances and coalitions that are premised, first and foremost, on women&#8217;s heterogeneity. It thus purports to offer a re-constructed vision of the &#8216;universal&#8217;. This is a universalism where differences and particularities are privileged in advance of any announcement of the &#8216;universal&#8217;. To do this, I first establish how the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217; emerged from different fields of scholarship, including postcolonial studies, indigenous political thought, Third World, postcolonial and poststructuralist feminisms. I then map the major features of the &#8216;feminist decolonizing impulse&#8217; by examining the work of important authors who have given shape to this impulse. To discover the strengths and weaknesses of the decolonizing impulse, I engage with the work of two prominent contemporary feminist theorists, Chandra Talpade Mohanty and Martha C. Nussbaum. Both Mohanty and Nussbaum aim to advance a model of cross-cultural feminism, though go about this in vastly different ways.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">gender; feminism; cultural difference; decolonizing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Group Norms, Audiences, and Social Identities on Moral Judgment</field><field name="creator">Lisa Abel</field><field name="description">Traditionally, it has been the cognitive-developmental approach that has dominated moral judgment research. Specifically, it has been Kohlberg&#8217;s theory of moral development (1969, 1986) that has provided the theoretical framework for much of the research in the field. According to the Kohlbergian perspective, individuals are rational agents who engage in conscious deliberation in order to reach a moral judgment or decision. In contrast to this, the social intuitionist model of moral judgment (Haidt, 2001; Haidt &amp; Bjorklund, 2007) proposes that it is the individual&#8217;s immediate affective reactions to events are the overriding cause of moral judgment. In addition to this, the model proposes that the social context is an equally important determinant of moral judgment. Emergent group norms are said to directly shape the moral judgments of the individual, with the moral judgments of friends, allies and acquaintances having a direct bearing on the moral judgments one makes, even those made and held privately. In the current thesis, the impact of social persuasion - group norms, audience, and social identity - on moral judgment was investigated, using the methods and meta-theoretical framework of the social identity approach. In Studies 1 (N = 98) and 2 (N = 60) the influence of group norms and level of identification with the reference group on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was assessed. The results of these studies revealed that participants&#8217; evaluation of the target issue (the sex selection of children) was not influenced by the group norms to which they were exposed. In both studies, the interaction between norm and identification was also found to be non-significant. Under investigation in Studies 3, 4, and 5 was the impact of normative influence on participants&#8217; moral evaluations. In Study 3 (N = 186) the impact of group norms, level of identification, and audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluations of morally-tinged scenarios and issues were assessed. Those exposed to a norm portraying the reference group as judgmental tended to be harsher in their evaluations than those exposed to a non-judgmental norm, but the effect was weak and inconsistent. Contrary to expectation, identification and audience were not found to interact with the norm manipulation. Study 4 (N = 93) focused exclusively on the impact of audience expectation on participants&#8217; moral evaluation. Participants evaluated a number of morally-tinged scenarios either alone, under the expectation that their responses would be visible to an audience (with either the opportunity to justify their evaluations, or not), or under the pretext of being connected to a lie-detector. Contrary to expectation, no significant difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found across the four audience conditions. To discount the possibility that the lack of normative influence on moral evaluation obtained in Study 4 was due to methodological limitation (i.e., the audience category was too broad), the selection of participants and the choice of audience were modified for Study 5 (N = 54). In Study 5, Christian students were required to make their moral evaluations under the expectation that their responses would be made visible to either a Christian or student audience. Contrary to expectation, only a subtle effect of audience was found in relation to both the morally tinged issues and the morally tinged scenarios. Participants in the Christian audience condition were found to evaluate only a small number of the issues (3 of 10), and only one of the four scenarios more negatively than those in the student audience condition. In Studies 6 and 7 the impact of social identity factors on participants&#8217; moral evaluations was investigated. In Study 6 (N = 45), the extent to which participants&#8217; moral evaluation were influenced by their social identity was assessed. In this study, participants had either their Christian identity or their student identity made salient when making their evaluations. No difference in participants&#8217; moral evaluations was found between the Christian identity and student identity salience conditions. In Study 7 (N = 68), the extent to which participants&#8217; political identity influenced their moral evaluation of government policy was assessed. Participants (who were either Australian Labor Party supporters or Australian Liberal Party supporters) were led to believe that the policies had been proposed by either the Australian Labor Party or the Australian Liberal Party. It was found that participants&#8217; political affiliation contributed to their moral evaluation of the presented policies. Overall, the current program of studies provides a first step toward understanding the impact that group norms, audience, and social identity factors have on the evaluation component of moral judgment. It suggests that morality is complex, and that moral judgments may be amenable to social influence, albeit weakly. Theoretical and practical implications for this research are discussed with reference to social identity theory and the broader literature on moral psychology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">group norms, audiences, social identities, moral judgment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:167552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management in Malaysian five star hotels: Human resource practices system differentiation and its outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rozila Ahmad</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis explores the management of human resources (HR) in five star hotels located in a developing country (Malaysia). This study is particularly relevant to the hotel industry, known for its traditionally poor HR practices (e.g., a lack of employment security, training, and career development opportunity, low levels of employee involvement and an increasing number of casual employees who are paid hourly). These practices are often perceived as a solution to high labour costs and fluctuating demand prevalent in the hotel industry. However, it is often only "non-managerial" employees who are affected by poor HR practices, as more sophisticated approaches to HR practices are often taken with regard to managerial (strategic) level employees. HR practices system differentiation (HRPSD), or HR architecture, involves having more than one HR practices system within an organisation. HRPSD has been criticised in the hospitality management literature for the poor HR practices in the management of non-managerial employees, however despite this criticism, it is widely practiced by the industry. The continuation of HRPSD practices in the hotel industry suggests its importance to better understand, research and study. The aim of this research is to gain an understanding of HRPSD in a hotel industry context, and to better understand the immediate effects of such practices. While the existing literature concerning HR architecture in other industries provides some discussion of HRPSD, research and study of the concept focusing on the hotel industry is essential in providing a detailed explanation of the effect of this phenomenon, as HR practices between industries may vary. Central to this study, is an investigation of the nature of HRPSD, identification of HR intermediate outcomes, and the effects of HRPSD on hotel employees. Studying the effect of HRPSD on employees is important because employees are known to be a hotel organisations&#8223; most important resource. Developed based on the literature of SHRM and HR architecture, this study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates HRPSD in the SHRM model originally proposed by Schuler, Dowling, Smart, and Huber (1992). Guided by this model, this study seeks to answer the critical questions of &#8220;how organisations differentiate their HR practices systems&#8221; and &#8220;what are the corresponding HR intermediate outcomes?&#8221; A particular foci of this thesis relates to how the concept of a &#8220;strategic&#8221; (or managerial) job is conceptualised in the hotel industry, what the elements of HR practices systems in five-star hotels are, how and why hotel organisations differentiate their HR practices systems, what the HR intermediate outcomes of HRPSD are and how HRPSD relates to the identified HR intermediate outcomes. To answer these complex research issues, a multiple case research methodology is employed, utilising a series of in depth semi-structured interviews. This vi study focuses specifically on five-star hotels in Malaysia because HR practices vary among hotels of various sizes. The findings indicate a notable effect of HRPSD on employees&#8223; motivation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and retention, and that excessive differentiation is not beneficial for a five star hotel. In this study only certain HR practices were found to be differentiated; selective staffing, extensive training, compensation and empowerment. HR practices that were applied to all employees without differentiation were a clear job description, orientation, employment security, objective performance appraisal, career development opportunity and effective communication. In addition, this study also provides a clear definition of the strategic job in the hotel industry, and demonstrates the importance of HR practices integration and the influence of internal and external environments on the formation of HR strategy. This research contributes to theory as well as hotel sector policy and practice. Theoretically, it has identified how HRPSD links to firm performance (in Malaysian five star hotels). In addition, it provides clear definitions and understanding of the strategic job concept as well as identification of HR practices system elements and their differentiation in five-star hotels. Furthermore, the theoretical framework developed can be useful for future quantitative studies which can test the model formulated in this study. For practitioners, the detailed examination of HR practices system elements and how they are differentiated may guide them in their future HR strategy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel, strategy, human resource management, practices system, differentiation, intermediate outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion of the Concept of Sustainable Tourism Development: A Case Study on Kret Island, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Siriphen Dabphet</field><field name="description">Sustainable tourism development is widely accepted as an alternative approach to tourism development in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable in part to a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders&#8217; understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to destination stakeholders as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">sustainable tourism development, diffusion of innovation theory, communication channels, innovation characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">My Arthritic Heart.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating a large scale collaborative venture (LSCV) project: An approach to economic growth based on a strategic marketing evaluation of the Multifunction Polis Project (1987 - 1990)</field><field name="creator">Briggs, Maxwell James</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Multifunction polis.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The introduction of the music of ethnic minority groups into Queensland State Schools</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Judith M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">9304 School/Institution</field><field name="subject">750306 Ethnicity and multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">School music -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict and conflict management in urban planning : the application of general theories to urban planning in the Queensland Local Government context</field><field name="creator">Minnery, J.

One aspect of hearing is loudness, to which the field of psychophysics attempts to ascribe a physical correlate intrinsic to the incoming acoustic wave. For over 50 years psychophysicists have attempted to explicitly define the just-noticeable difference (JND) for loudness: the smallest amount, in physical units, that a stimulus needs to be increased to produce a perceptual difference. A review of the literature suggests that the problem in defining the JND is twofold. Firstly there is the measurement problem, with specific weighting on two competing measures of the JND: the level difference (&#916;L) vs. the Weber fraction (&#916;X/X). Deciding between the two measures has proved difficult: within the natural operating range of the auditory system the two measures are directly proportional to one another. Secondly there is the units problem, concerned with the physical unit in which the measure should be expressed. The units problem exists because it has yet to be determined which property of the acoustic stimulus accounts for the perception of loudness. There are several candidates: acoustic pressure (p); acoustic intensity (I); acoustic power (P), and acoustic energy (E). The necessity of determining which, if any, is the proper measure of the stimulus is forced by the phenomenon of negative masking, which is manifest when the stimulus is expressed in terms of pressure. Selecting among the various quantities is complicated by the fact that the four measures are linearly related and constitute a direct transformation of one another. In the laboratory context existing techniques can produce stimuli that severely challenge the auditory system and break down the proportionality exhibited by the various candidate JNDs. These techniques however require greater scrutiny and development. Buus and Florentine (1991) have proposed that the JND measure (i.e., &#916;p/p, &#916;I/I, &#916;L) that realizes a linear relationship with the detectability index, d&#8217;, is the correct measure. The proportionality of the measures makes such comparison complicated, and threshold values need to be inflated by manipulating stimulus parameters in order to exceed the range of proportionality. This is accomplished using short duration (10-ms) sinusoids and low level masking noise. The experimental program commenced with a series of negative masking experiments to ensure the phenomenon is still relevant to short duration stimuli. Laming&#8217;s (1986) sensory analytical model, which assumes the auditory system responds to pressure, provided an acceptable fit to these data. Experiments on the pedestal effect, a related phenomenon, generated fixed-increment functions that could be compared to the masking functions generated from the negative masking data. A consistent relationship between the two was found when the stimuli were expressed in units of pressure. Attention then turned to improving the studies undertaken by Buus and Florentine (1991) to determine what the proper measure of the JND should be. A series of experiments, differentiated by stimulus conditions, suggest a JND measure expressed in pressure units had the most linear relationship with d&#8217;. The results argue for pressure as the correct measure of the stimulus, and &#916;p/p to be the most qualified representative of the JND.

A large-scale mensurative experiment was used to investigate the distribution of two size classes of macrofauna with distance from the reef edge across three locations in northeastern New Zealand. The role of reef-associated predators, the snapper (Pagrus auratus Sparidae) and rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii Palinuridae), was investigated using established marine reserves at each location. Consistent patterns were found in a few large-bodied fauna. The hermit crab Pagurus novizelandiae occurred more frequently near the reef edge, whilst the heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum and bivalve Dosinia subrosea were more abundant further away from the reef. Dosinia subrosea and another bivalve, Myadora striata, exhibited lower biomass at sites with higher densities of snapper and rock lobster. In contrast, small-bodied macrofauna showed no consistent patterns with distance from the reef or among sites with different predator populations. It was hypothesised that predation was driving the distribution of large bivalves. An experiment was done to investigate this model using D. subrosea. Equal densities of this bivalve were established in plots either with or without cages at sites either inside or outside of reserves. Significant predation was detected, but only inside reserves. Much of this mortality could be specifically attributed to predation by large rock lobsters, given the distinctive marks on the valves of dead D. subrosea. Inside reserves, predators are not only more abundant but also larger. It was hypothesised that different size classes of predators would result in different levels of predation. Laboratory feeding experiments were used to investigate this model. Lobsters of all sizes chose D. subrosea over the heavier shelled D. anus. Small lobsters chose to prey on small D. subrosea and large lobsters more frequently chose larger prey. The distributions of these two bivalve species at protected (large predators) and fished sites (small predators) reflected the feeding choices observed in the laboratory. Results suggested that rock lobster populations are capable, where their size structure is not truncated by fishing pressure, of controlling population-level dynamics of bivalve communities adjacent to reefs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics and ecology of northern Hauraki Gulf Bryozoa</field><field name="creator">Whitten, Ronald Francis.</field><field name="description">The bryozoan faunas of 104 sediment grab samples and 29 shore and shallow water collections from the northern Hauraki Gulf are described and illustrated. 175 species and subspecies are recognised, 23 of which are described as new and a further 8 recognised as new but not formally described owing to their poor state of preservation. One new genus, Maoricellepora, is proposed. The new species described are Conopeum zelandicum, Amphiblestrum remuliformis, Chaperiopsis uttleyi, C. browni, Beania huttoni, Caberea breviscuta, Celleporaria (Celleporaria) haurakiensis, Macricellepora parva, Urceolipora hyalina, Conescharellina depressa, Sphaeropora granulata, Haswellina triavicularis, Smittoidea tawharanuiensis, Diastopora haurakiensis, D. kotahirau, D. maangainui, Tubulipora haurakiensis, Hastingsia maoriana, Crisia zelandica, Hornera aotearoa, H. gracilis, Crisina haurakiensis and Disporella bicuspis, and the new subspecies is Beania inermis zelandica. The Anascina is subdivided into superfamilies based largely on the 'Divisions' of previous authors. The main environmental factors in the northern Hauraki Gulf are summarised and their effect on the bryozoan fauna discussed. The substrate preferences of some species are recognised. The distribution and diversity patterns of the bryozoan fauna are examined, the greatest numbers and highest diversities being in the coarse sediments, the faunas of the fine sands and muds being sparse. The eschariform and vinculariiform growth types are redefined and the assemblages analysed in terms of zoarial form. Differences from some previous investigations of bryozoan growth form distributions are the absence of reteporiform species from shallow water, and the presence in shallow water of vinculariiform species in which the outer walls have been strengthened by secondary calcification or the branches are anastomosing. A brief discussion is given on the use of Bryozoa in palaeoenvironmental analysis in the light of this and previous studies on bryozoan distribution.</field><field name="date">1979</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Extracellular polymers of Acidovorax temperans</field><field name="creator">Heijstra, Bjo&#776;rn D.</field><field name="description">All modern wastewater treatment systems rely on microbial processes for water clarification, with some 70% of systems utilising some form of the activated sludge process. This thesis describes an investigation into the extracellular polymers of a consistent member of the activated sludge microbial community: Acidovorax temperans. Several types of polymers are present on the cellular surface of A. temperans which were hypothesised to play a role in cellular and cell-surface interactions. The two morphotypes of A. temperans (Hpos and Hneg) were proposed to enable the study of these extracellular polymers in wastewater treatment related processes, such as biofilm formation and flocculation. The initial aim of this research was to chemically characterise and compare the exopolysaccharides produced by the two morphotypes. The results are described in Chapter Three; it was found the Hpos strain consistently produced exopolysaccharides in greater abundance, although exopolysaccharides from both strains shared a similar monosaccharide composition, which in turn, was nutrient dependent. Due to subsequent findings of large amounts of extracellular DNA in EPS fractions, it was further hypothesised that extracellular DNA is utilised as a structural element in biofilm formation by A. temperans. This is described in Chapter Four; enzymatic breakdown of extracellular DNA resulted in impaired biofilm formation. In addition, the presence of Type IV pili was also essential for cellular attachment to surfaces, while the underlying binding mechanism was concluded to be electrostatic. These results add further to the recently emerging notion that extracellular DNA could function as a structural molecule outside the cell. To date, this is the first reported study on an extracellular DNA and Type IV pili combined attachment mechanism. In addition, this thesis describes the most detailed study to date on exopolysaccharides from a member of the Comamonadaceae. An obvious function for Acidovorax in the activated sludge environment was not indicated by these studies on the presence, function and composition of extracellular polymers. However the discovery that eDNA and Type IV pili mediate cell-cell and cell-surface attachment in this organism provides a fertile starting point for investigating the contribution of these interactions to initiation and promotion of flocculation in activated sludge systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What can I understand about children with special needs from the musical offerings that emerge in the music therapy process? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Music Therapy at New Zealand School of Music, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cammell, Shane</field><field name="description">This arts-based research thesis sought to understand two children with special needs, through their musical offerings within the context of their music therapy sessions. The process of understanding the children came through firstly listening to and extracting meaningful musical data from recordings of their sessions. This data included both actual excerpts of the musical interplays between the child and music therapist (myself), and more broadly, underlying themes drawn from the recorded session material. The data was then creatively &#8216;melded&#8217;, resulting in two original instrumental works, herein referred to as 'songs'. Before, during and after writing the songs, rigorous analyses were undertaken utilising both a formal approach, via the use of a contextual question framework, and two creative approaches: free-form narration and data-led imagery. The contextual question framework, involving the repetitive use of two key questions - where? and why? - sought to understand the data&#8217;s context, its purpose for inclusion, and its influence on the respective song. One of the creative approaches, that of free-form narration, sought to, rather than analysing the song through formal structures, instead &#8216;tell the song&#8217;s story&#8217;, narratively conveying the experience of being with the child in his music. The other creative approach, that of data-led imagery, involved creating images during and after being &#8216;immersed&#8217; in the musical data, employing instinctive or subconscious means to further develop the therapist&#8217;s understanding of the child&#8217;s musical offerings, and moreover, the child himself. Upon completion of the two songs, it was discovered that clinical themes present from the sessions strongly influenced the song creation process.

Fat based spreads have been shown to be a very successful vehicle for delivery of plant sterols, readily accepted by consumers and efficacious in reducing cholesterol levels. Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread is a new product entering into the market place. It is derived from rice bran oil and contains high levels of unsaponifiable material rich in phytosterols, triterpene alcohols, ferulic acid esters ([gamma]-oryzanol) and vitamin E isomers. As such it may have the potential to lower serum cholesterol levels when consumed on a daily basis. In order to establish the effectiveness of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread compared with Flora pro-activ&#174; margarine, a well established brand of plant sterol margarine already proven to lower cholesterol, a randomised double blind cross-over human clinical trial over 12 weeks was conducted. The study was divided into two treatment arms. The first arm of the study was to determine whether Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread (containing 1.5% plant sterols) could lower total and LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than standard Flora margarine (containing no plant sterols) or Flora Pro-activ&#174; margarine (containing 8% plant sterols). The second study arm tested the proposition that daily consumption of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread in conjunction with rice bran oil (containing 0.5% plant sterols) would lower total and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in isolation and more than Flora margarine in conjunction with sunflower oil. Eighty mildly hypercholesterolaemic individuals (total cholesterol [greater than or equal to] 5 mmol/L and [less than or equal to] 7.5 mmol/L) were recruited and randomised into two groups of forty. Participants were asked to continue with their normal dietary pattern but to replace any margarine/butter/fat consumption with the trial products. One group of 40 were then assigned to the first treatment arm of the study (margarine-only group) and were randomised to consume 20 g (4 teaspoons) Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine daily for 4 weeks, or 20 Flora pro-activ&#174; daily for 4 weeks. Phytosterol levels delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma]-oryzanol; Flora proactiv&#174; 1600 mg phytosterol; Flora margarine 0mg phytosterol. The second group of 40 were allocated to the second arm of the trial (margarine and oil group) and consumed 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread and 30 ml rice bran oil (RBO) daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine and 30 ml sunflower oil daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, changing treatment at the end of each 4-week period. Phytosterol amounts delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118 mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma] oryzanol; RBO 222mg mg phytosterol, 150 mg [gamma] oryzanol. Each participant consumed all three treatments in a random order over a 12 week period. At baseline and following each 4 week intervention period, measurements were made of weight and blood pressure. Venous blood samples were collected for analysis of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol: HDL-C, triglycerides and plasma phytosterols. Three-day diet records from each individual were also collected for analysis of normal dietary intake. Results showed that compared to a standard Flora margarine, Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread significantly reduced total cholesterol by 2.2% (P=0.045), total cholesterol:HDL by 4.1% (P=0.005) and LDL-C by 3.5% (P=0.016), but was not as effective overall as Flora Pro-activ&#174; which reduced total cholesterol by 4.4% (P=0.001), total cholesterol:HDL by 3.4% (P=0.014) and LDL-C by 5.6% (P=0.001). Consumption of Flora margarine alone produced no significant decrease from baseline figures in any of the cholesterol parameters measured. Surprisingly, in group two, the addition of rice bran oil to the Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread produced no differences in cholesterol levels. The reason for this unexpected result is being explored further. These results confirm that Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread is effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels when consumed as part of a normal diet. Studies have shown that a 1% reduction in LDL-C can equate to a 2% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk thus suggesting that the 3.5% reduction demonstrated by Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in this study could be effective in reducing CHD risk as much as 6% in a mildly hypercholesterolaemic population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human nutrition</field><field name="subject">rice bran oil margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora pro-activ margarine</field><field name="subject">phytosterols</field><field name="subject">plant sterols</field><field name="subject">reduction of serum cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can midlife nurses be supported to deliver bedside care in the acute clinical services until retirement? : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the degree of Master of Philosophy (Nursing), Massey University, Turitea, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dodsworth, Caroline</field><field name="description">As the baby boomer generation move inexorably towards retirement and the requirement for health care services increases, the supply of nurses available to provide care at the patient bedside is forecast to fall significantly short of demand. This thesis has explored the perspectives of midlife nurses, asking what it would take to keep them in bedside practice until retirement. These nurses have provided insights which offer employers of valuable senior nurses, suggestions for maximising their potential. Through the use of questionnaires and focus groups nurses aged 45 years and over were asked what the employer can do to ensure that they are able to continue to work at the patient bedside until they reach the age of retirement. The results of this research demonstrate a workforce of nurses who are passionate and committed to their profession, but feeling disillusioned and disempowered. The nursing environment has changed over the span of their career and they find the increased workload, together with increasing professional demands, too hard to cope with. They feel they have no control over their workload, their shift patterns, or the expectations of their patients and colleagues. They want their experience to be recognized but they do not want to have to prove competency; they want to have a voice but they are unwilling to pursue postgraduate education to learn how to become visible and emancipated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">baby boomers</field><field name="subject">professional demands</field><field name="subject">age and employment</field><field name="subject">nursing practice</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Backward bifurcation in SIR endemic models : this thesis is presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Information Science in Mathematics at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siddiqui, Sameeha Qaiser</field><field name="description">In the well known SIR endemic model, the infection-free steady state is globally stable for R0 &lt; 1 and unstable for R0 &gt; 1. Hence, we have a forward bifurcation when R0 = 1. When R0 &gt; 1, an asymptotically stable endemic steady state exists. The basic reproduction number R0 is the main threshold bifurcation parameter used to determine the stability of steady states of SIR endemic models. In this thesis we study extensions of the SIR endemic model for which a backward bifurcation may occur at R0 = 1. We investigate the biologically reasonable conditions for the change of stability. We also analyse the impact of di erent factors that lead to a backward bifurcation both numerically and analytically. A backward bifurcation leads to sub-critical endemic steady states and hysteresis. We also provide a general classi cation of such models, using a small amplitude expansion near the bifurcation. Additionally, we present a procedure for projecting three dimensional models onto two dimensional models by applying some linear algebraic techniques. The four extensions examined are: the SIR model with a susceptible recovered class; nonlinear transmission; exogenous infection; and with a carrier class. Numerous writers have mentioned that a nonlinear transmission function in relation to the infective class, can only lead to a system with an unstable endemic steady state. In spite of this we show that in a nonlinear transmission model, we have a function depending on the infectives and satisfying certain biological conditions, and leading to a sub-critical endemic equilibriums.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mathematical biology</field><field name="subject">linear algebra</field><field name="subject">nonlinear transmission</field><field name="subject">exogenous infection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taupaenui : Maori positive ageing : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edwards, William John Werahiko</field><field name="description">The global phenomenon of population ageing has major ramifications for societies and governments around the world. In New Zealand, efforts to address the impacts of population ageing have centred on the Government&#8217;s Positive Ageing Strategy. This is a thesis about positive ageing as viewed through Maori eyes. It has been informed by the memories and aspirations of older Maori who have lived through challenging times but have emerged with qualities that enable them to enjoy older age and to contribute to their own whanau, Te Ao Maori (the Maori world) and Te Ao Whanui (wider society). The thesis is philosophically located at the interface between Western science and matauranga Maori, an Indigenous inquiry paradigm. It is argued that Western science and matauranga Maori are relevant to research in the contemporary context, and reflect the realities of older Maori who live in both Te Ao Maori and Te Ao Whanui. The study used research techniques that draw on Western science (literature review), matauranga Maori (review of 42 Maori proverbs) and both inquiry paradigms simultaneously (qualitative study with 20 older Maori people). The research found that Maori positive ageing can be characterised by a two dimensional concept that incorporates a process dimension and an outcome dimension. The process dimension is consistent with a lifecourse perspective and therefore recognises that ageing is a life-long process where circumstances encountered during life may impact cumulatively and manifest in old age. The outcome dimension can be described in terms of complementary &#8216;universal&#8217; and Maori specific outcome domains. The universal outcome domains are encapsulated in the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy and more recently are expressed in the Positive Ageing Indicators 2007 Report. The Maori-specific outcome domains identified in this Study are: kaitiakitanga &#8211; stewardship; whanaungatanga &#8211; connectedness; taketuku &#8211; transmission; takoha &#8211; contribution; takatu &#8211; adaptability; and, tino rangatiratanga &#8211; selfdetermination.

There is a need for an holistic model of learning organisations and a measurement system that can be used by both researchers and practitioners. This thesis applies Dilemma Theory as a means of meeting this need. An holistic model was developed based on a definition of learning organisations as ones that consciously seek to balance capacities with demands. In seeking this balance, an organisation will undertake a learning journey in which it encounters a variety of learning dilemmas: points where it must choose between alternative approaches to learning, each of which is attractive. In making these choices, learning-related values are established in the organisation. These values are the basis for a "learning culture" which shapes the way learning is understood and approached by the organisational community. Presenting people within an organisation with learning-related dilemmas allows learning cultures to be charted, thus providing the basis for a measurement system. Fifteen learning-related dilemmas were identified using three processes. Firstly, literature on learning organisations was reviewed to identify conflicts between metaphors used to explain the learning organisation. Secondly, a group of New Zealand consultants took part in a Delphi Technique process, in which they established criteria for identifying learning organisations and surfaced dilemmas embedded in the criteria. Finally, 'Culture Exploration Workshops' were conducted in three organisations to surface dilemmas experienced by business practitioners engaged in learning journeys. The 15 dilemmas identified were used to chart differences between 5 organisations. The measurement system was successful in identifying differences between organisations. Results were also consistent with values that might be expected from sub-cultures represented in the sample. The study concluded by outlining a programme of research aimed at refining the measurement system and applying it to the study of learning organisations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anaerobic co-digestion of municipal primary sludge and whey : a dissertation submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters degree in Environmental Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xinyuan</field><field name="description">The aim of this research was to investigate the feasibility of co-digestion of municipal primary sludge and whey by anaerobic CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor), as well as the factors that affect the performance of the co-digestion reactors. Before studying the co-digestion process, a semi-continuous whey digestion experiment was conducted to analyze the feasibility of anaerobic digestion of whey along with pH control. The results obtained from the study indicated that supplement of nutrients, trace elements as well as heavy metals was necessary to maintain the anaerobic whey digestion system. To investigate the co-digestion of primary sludge and whey process, the effects of pH, OLR (Organic Loading Rate), HRT (Hydraulic retention time) as well as the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) loading ratio of primary sludge to whey on the performance of the reactors were studied. The results of the co-digestion experiments demonstrated that it was feasible to co-digest primary sludge and whey without nutrient, trace element and heavy metal supplement. The TCOD (Total Chemical Oxygen Demand) removal efficiency and the biogas production of the co-digestion system increased with the increase of OLR. At same OLR, digestion of the mixture of primary sludge and whey with higher whey content achieved higher biogas production and TCOD removal efficiency. The anaerobic co-digestion of primary sludge and whey process performed successfully at OLR of 5.8 &#177; 0.1g COD/l.d without pH control when the COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey was approximately 70:30, due to the fact that the primary sludge may serve as buffering reagent. By adding sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) to maintain the pH at 6.9 &#177; 0.1, the OLR of the co-digestion reactor could reach 8.1 &#177; 0.1 g COD/l.d at HRT of 20 days. Moreover, by co-digestion of primary sludge and whey solution, the reactor could be operated successfully at HRT of 10 days and at OLR of 7.6 &#177; 0.1 g COD/l.d with COD loading ratio of primary sludge to whey of 53 : 47. The biogas production (3.2 &#177; 0.1 l/d) was 1.5 l/d higher than digestion of the same amount of primary sludge alone (1.7 &#177; 0.1 l/d).</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291102 Bio-remediation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural and physiological responses of domestic sheep (Ovis aries) to the presence of humans and dogs :|ba thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beausoleil, Ngaio Jessica</field><field name="description">Appendices removed due to copyright restrictions  Appendix 1: Beausoleil, N J, Stafford, KJ, Mellor, DJ. 2005.

They began in an atmosphere of disciplined quasi-military emergency response organizations. Emergency management research, theory and practice have since evolved to incorporate comprehensive facets acknowledging disasters are about people, individually and collectively and their environment. Emergency Management now includes addressing psycho-social aspects. New Zealand emergency services adopted the Coordinated Incident Management System (CIMS) as a result of a requirement following the Cave Creek disaster of 1995, where a multi- agency response to the event was found to be unsatisfactorily managed. Emergency management in the modern era now requires the orchestration of many and varied agencies and organisations including government and non-government organisations. These organisations are not necessarily suited to command type management styles and during a recovery phase of an incident, an approach involving a coordination style is more appropriate than a command style. An examination of the 2004 eastern Bay of Plenty flood event highlights that improved coordination by using a suitable incident management system benefits the response and recovery process. The Eastern Bay of Plenty community has social and cultural characteristics that impact on the effectiveness of emergency management outcomes. An incident management system that improves communication within the multi-agency organisation and between an emergency management organisation and the disaster-affected communities contributes to overall trauma reduction by stress reduction and facilitating early support and interventions. This allows where necessary, for modern emergency management to use systems that can utilise the unique community cultures, structures and networks that form the dynamic communities that they serve. If disasters magnify pre-existing social and community problems then the incident management system model used in a disaster can determine the degree of magnification.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency management</field><field name="subject">Incident Management System</field><field name="subject">Disaster relief</field><field name="subject">Bay of Plenty, New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::359900 Other Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">School improvement : the route taken by an urban primary school in the Republic of Maldives : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Didi, Ahmed Ali</field><field name="description">The primary and secondary schools in the Maldives serve over one third of the total population. Having achieved universalization of primary education, one of the challenges of the education system now is to improve the quality of primary education. Studies done in the past, to explore quality in primary education, have been quantitative in nature, telling only part of the story when it comes to describing improvement efforts. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore in detail how a primary school in an urban setting of the Maldives deals with school improvement efforts. A qualitative case study, informed by the interpretivist research paradigm, was used to explore this issue. One of the primary schools in Male' was purposefully selected for this study and 48 participants took part, of whom thirteen were students. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, participant observations, document reviews and administering of questionnaires. The findings of this study suggest that there were three major dimensions or three interrelated, key concepts that together undergirded the improvement efforts in the school. They are change, leadership and culture. In action-oriented terms, these dimensions or concepts translated into managing change, attending to specific leader actions and influencing the school's culture, respectively, reflecting six themes of school improvement. They are: a focus on change, a focus on students, a teaching learning focus, investing in staff, strong leadership by the head and school culture. In addition to these, it was noted that these themes emerged as having significance to the school's improvement efforts against the backdrop of many stakeholder influences and contextual factors. In essence, the findings of this study portray the micro-level realities of the working of a school that is consciously and continuously striving for improving educational practice. In conclusion to the study, research implications and areas for further research have been identified that would inform educational policy and practice in the Republic of Maldives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">School leadership</field><field name="subject">Primary education</field><field name="subject">Change in schools</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discontinuous distributions of iconic New Zealand plant taxa and their implications for southern hemisphere biogeography : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Knapp, Michael</field><field name="description">Content removed due to copyright restriction: Knapp M., Stockler K., Havell D., Delsuc F., Sebastiani F. &amp; Lockhart P.J.

The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamics of N-qubit chains</field><field name="creator">Mr Courtney Mewton</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bifurcations, Phase Transitions and Teleportation in Entangled Quantum Systems</field><field name="creator">John Paul Barjaktarevic</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making a Mark: negotiations in the commoditisation of authenticity and value at an Aboriginal art dealership</field><field name="creator">Barbara Ashford</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of processes of the dealership regarding Aboriginal art and artists. I take the approach that the art dealership is situated at a nexus of relationships that contest and negotiate culturally informed values and categories of fine art, Aboriginality and commodities. I argue that dealers in Aboriginal art mediate categories of value through their particular practices of representation of the art and through the social relationships they foster with artists and buyers. Therefore, through the relationships formed in the exchange process, dealers both make and mark culture. In this study I acknowledge the agency of Aboriginal artists but approach the process of negotiation of cultural categories from the perspective of the non-Indigenous audience for which the art is intended. The research is specifically concentrated on a particular dealership, Fire-Works gallery in Brisbane. I begin with the premise that buyers are drawn to Aboriginal art for more than aesthetic reasons and that objects and artists&#8217; cultural identities carry high value especially if judged authentically Aboriginal in the current art market. Both the art and the artists are made and marked as commodities in the art market; and while notions of authenticity are central to value, value is itself shifting and authenticity unstable. To establish the tensions and shifts in culture formation, I outline the historical biography of the acceptance of Aboriginal objects as fine art and the genesis of Fire-Works gallery within this socio-cultural and political milieu. In the latter chapters of the thesis I examine social relationships and situated practices chosen by the dealership to facilitate sales through the negotiation of valued cultural categories. The study provides an original examination of how shifting cultural categories are dynamically formed and reformed in the commoditisation of Aboriginal art by social agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts - General</field><field name="subject">value, commoditisation, art, exchange, authenticity</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategic human resource management in Malaysian five star hotels: Human resource practices system differentiation and its outcomes</field><field name="creator">Rozila Ahmad</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis explores the management of human resources (HR) in five star hotels located in a developing country (Malaysia). This study is particularly relevant to the hotel industry, known for its traditionally poor HR practices (e.g., a lack of employment security, training, and career development opportunity, low levels of employee involvement and an increasing number of casual employees who are paid hourly). These practices are often perceived as a solution to high labour costs and fluctuating demand prevalent in the hotel industry. However, it is often only "non-managerial" employees who are affected by poor HR practices, as more sophisticated approaches to HR practices are often taken with regard to managerial (strategic) level employees. HR practices system differentiation (HRPSD), or HR architecture, involves having more than one HR practices system within an organisation. HRPSD has been criticised in the hospitality management literature for the poor HR practices in the management of non-managerial employees, however despite this criticism, it is widely practiced by the industry. The continuation of HRPSD practices in the hotel industry suggests its importance to better understand, research and study. The aim of this research is to gain an understanding of HRPSD in a hotel industry context, and to better understand the immediate effects of such practices. While the existing literature concerning HR architecture in other industries provides some discussion of HRPSD, research and study of the concept focusing on the hotel industry is essential in providing a detailed explanation of the effect of this phenomenon, as HR practices between industries may vary. Central to this study, is an investigation of the nature of HRPSD, identification of HR intermediate outcomes, and the effects of HRPSD on hotel employees. Studying the effect of HRPSD on employees is important because employees are known to be a hotel organisations&#8223; most important resource. Developed based on the literature of SHRM and HR architecture, this study proposes a conceptual model that incorporates HRPSD in the SHRM model originally proposed by Schuler, Dowling, Smart, and Huber (1992). Guided by this model, this study seeks to answer the critical questions of &#8220;how organisations differentiate their HR practices systems&#8221; and &#8220;what are the corresponding HR intermediate outcomes?&#8221; A particular foci of this thesis relates to how the concept of a &#8220;strategic&#8221; (or managerial) job is conceptualised in the hotel industry, what the elements of HR practices systems in five-star hotels are, how and why hotel organisations differentiate their HR practices systems, what the HR intermediate outcomes of HRPSD are and how HRPSD relates to the identified HR intermediate outcomes. To answer these complex research issues, a multiple case research methodology is employed, utilising a series of in depth semi-structured interviews. This vi study focuses specifically on five-star hotels in Malaysia because HR practices vary among hotels of various sizes. The findings indicate a notable effect of HRPSD on employees&#8223; motivation, job satisfaction, organisational commitment and retention, and that excessive differentiation is not beneficial for a five star hotel. In this study only certain HR practices were found to be differentiated; selective staffing, extensive training, compensation and empowerment. HR practices that were applied to all employees without differentiation were a clear job description, orientation, employment security, objective performance appraisal, career development opportunity and effective communication. In addition, this study also provides a clear definition of the strategic job in the hotel industry, and demonstrates the importance of HR practices integration and the influence of internal and external environments on the formation of HR strategy. This research contributes to theory as well as hotel sector policy and practice. Theoretically, it has identified how HRPSD links to firm performance (in Malaysian five star hotels). In addition, it provides clear definitions and understanding of the strategic job concept as well as identification of HR practices system elements and their differentiation in five-star hotels. Furthermore, the theoretical framework developed can be useful for future quantitative studies which can test the model formulated in this study. For practitioners, the detailed examination of HR practices system elements and how they are differentiated may guide them in their future HR strategy formation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hotel, strategy, human resource management, practices system, differentiation, intermediate outcomes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format. Opportunities for participants to touch, hug and interact directly with the therapy dog should be maximised without compromising dog welfare. The findings suggest that respect for the personhood of participants is important to the success of the therapy types trialled, which further supports psychosocial therapies involving contact with people or live animals for use with people with dementia over those that minimise or exclude it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversional Therapy</field><field name="subject">Therapy Treatment</field><field name="subject">alternative therapies</field><field name="subject">Dementia care</field><field name="subject">Dementia Of The Alzheimer Type</field><field name="subject">Animal-assisted Therapy</field><field name="subject">Aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Residential aged care facilities</field><field name="subject">Leisure Activities</field><field name="subject">bonding, human-pet</field><field name="subject">Dogs Canis-familiaris</field><field name="subject">Geriatric nursing</field><field name="subject">Geriatric Depression Scale</field><field name="subject">Sf-36</field><field name="subject">QoL</field><field name="subject">MSE</field><field name="subject">Depression Treatment</field><field name="subject">behavioural and psychosocial factors</field><field name="subject">prosocial behaviour</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="subject">Intervention Trial</field><field name="subject">Intervention strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Healing architecture': A study of daylight in public hospital designs in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Srazali Aripin</field><field name="description">In the hospital building, where patients seek medical treatment and hospital staff provide continuous support, creating a healing environment is an imperative. However, it appears that the ultimate aim to create a healing environment is not given due attention by healthcare designers. Patients&#8217; negative experiences of the existing physical environment of a hospital building describing as depressing, confusing, dull, little natural light, stressful, noisy causing sleep deprivation, anxiety, isolation and physical restraint were noted in many studies of the built environment. Most of these criticisms are also experienced by the patients in the case studies of hospital buildings in Malaysia, particularly on thermal (too warm) and visual (glare) discomfort. Therefore, the term &#8216;Healing Architecture&#8217; is adopted to invoke a sense of a continuous process; creating an environment physically healthy and psychologically appropriate for patients&#8217; well-being. A majority of the literature on the healing environment has reached a consensus that the physical aspects of built environment could contribute indirectly to the health outcomes of patients and staff in a hospital building. These include shorter length of stay, reduced stress and increased patients&#8217; satisfaction. Among the physical aspects, daylighting is considered one of the most influential factors to achieve visual comfort contributing to a healing environment. The thesis aims to explore daylighting performance of a four-bed ward by means of a parametric study of design variables in order to achieve the visual as well as thermal comfort in creating a healing environment. Conflicting issues of &#8216;physical to physical&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. solar heat gain) and &#8216;physical to psychological&#8217; (e.g. daylight vs. undesirable glare) are analysed. With the theme of daylight and health, previous studies related to the factors of the physical environments in hospital buildings that influence health outcomes are reviewed. The physical factors affecting daylighting to achieve visual comfort are also analysed. Reviews of the project briefs of the completed public hospital buildings in Malaysia are also conducted and seven hospitals are selected as the case studies to investigate daylighting conditions of the existing four-bed ward environment. Triangulation by means of analyses through questionnaire, measurement and computer simulation is the method adopted for the investigation. Available simulation programs are reviewed for suitability and compatibility of the study. The simulation software (validated) used for the study is Integrated Environmental Solutions &#8211; Virtual Environment (IES&#8211;VE). Based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses, it can be concluded that visual comfort in the existing four-bed ward environments of public hospital buildings in Malaysia is not achieved. Factors contributing to the failure are that the conflicting priorities (i.e. &#8216;physical vs. physical&#8217; and &#8216;physical vs. psychological&#8217;) were not analysed by healthcare designers when designing a window (size and position), there is clear evidence of glare and daylighting design failed to meet the daylight factor (DF) requirement of 1% at the (innermost) bed-head. The finding is that a healing environment in the four-bed ward is not achieved. The results of the analysis also confirmed that the key physical factors affecting daylighting in the hospital ward are orientation, window design (size and position), external shading device, glass transmittance and indoor surface reflectances. Parametric studies of daylighting design variables on the &#8216;base case&#8217; unit are formulated in order to find the remedy as well as to arrive at design guidelines. The Subang TRY weather data set is used and examined and found the two worst conditions days of the year: the hottest (day 60) and the cloudy (day 299). Evaluation criteria for measuring thermal as well as visual comfort are established to critically analyse the consequences of the variants in the permutations. A total of 186 simulations are run to appraise the comfort condition of the computer model of the four-bed ward environment. The simulation of daylighting conditions in a four-bed ward environment would take into consideration the magnitude of solar heat gain of one exposed wall (opaque wall and glass window) for the two selected worst days of the year and the &#8216;best&#8217; orientation (other enclosing elements are taken as adiabatic). The results of the parametric study are analysed by adopting the process of elimination for the selection of variants. The variants of design variables that satisfy the evaluation criteria for comfort criteria set in the study are identified. Design recommendations are made and guidelines on how best to achieve visual comfort through daylighting design strategies in the hospital ward environment in the future are established. The findings arrive at two crucial conclusions in creating a healing environment. Firstly, visual comfort can be achieved through appropriate daylighting design.The second is that in order to achieve visual comfort in the four-bed ward environment there is a need to find a balance between the acceptable magnitude of solar heat gain and satisfying the requirement of daylighting (i.e. the acceptable limit of glare not exceeding a luminance ratio of 10 and 1% DF).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Healing architecture</field><field name="subject">Healing environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital design</field><field name="subject">Healthcare facilities</field><field name="subject">Daylighting design</field><field name="subject">Daylighting and lighting</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="subject">Hospital lighting</field><field name="subject">Lighting</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diffusion of the Concept of Sustainable Tourism Development: A Case Study on Kret Island, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Siriphen Dabphet</field><field name="description">Sustainable tourism development is widely accepted as an alternative approach to tourism development in many countries. However, the sustainable tourism development concept remains problematic, in both definitional and operational terms, attributable in part to a lack of effective channels for diffusion and communication of the concept to destination stakeholders. As such, this thesis aims to identify, understand, and describe effective communication mechanisms for the dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept, with the aim of facilitating a more effective implementation of it. To achieve this, three important issues are addressed. Firstly, identification of destination stakeholders&#8217; understanding of the sustainable tourism development concept; secondly, determination of the communication channels for diffusing the sustainable tourism development concept; and thirdly, identification of the key actors of the social system for transferring information about sustainable tourism development. In exploring these issues, the thesis is underpinned by diffusion of innovations theory, which constitutes an explanatory framework for considering the findings of 55 in-depth interviews with key tourism stakeholders on Kret Island, Thailand. The findings reveal that sustainable tourism development is considered important for tourism development in the destination; however, the implementation of such principles remains problematic as the term is complex and there is no common understanding of its implementation. In terms of the dimensions of sustainable tourism development, while economic, environmental and socio-cultural as the triple-bottom line aspects are still embedded in the concept, there are four additional dimensions of sustainable tourism development found in Kret Island, Thailand; these are the community integration, education, tourist satisfaction, and regulations dimensions. The findings further reveal that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept occurs through interpersonal as well as media communication, and that while these two types of communication have differing roles to play in disseminating information, there is synergy between them. Key actors in relevant social systems which facilitate dissemination of the sustainable tourism development concept to destination stakeholders are change agents; members of social networks and opinion leaders. Each actor has both differing roles and attributes when it comes to transferring information. The findings of this research provide a contribution to knowledge by highlighting that diffusion of the sustainable tourism development concept is related to aspects and qualities of the concept itself, the communication channels employed in its diffusion, both interpersonal and media, and the relative time of diffusion and adoption within the social system. It also offer some guidelines according to the characteristics of the people involved, the social systems involved and communications channels used for the key stakeholders on the island to develop appropriate communication channels in order to diffuse tourism information regarding sustainable tourism development to other destination stakeholders. Both the contributions and implications of this research have the potential to contribute to better dissemination of information regarding sustainable tourism development to destination stakeholders as a whole.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">sustainable tourism development, diffusion of innovation theory, communication channels, innovation characteristics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:208107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The introduction of the music of ethnic minority groups into Queensland State Schools</field><field name="creator">Butcher, Judith M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">9304 School/Institution</field><field name="subject">750306 Ethnicity and multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Music -- Instruction and study -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">School music -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post Harvest Studies on the Kangaroo Paw (Anigozanthos sp.)

The rationale was to use controlled traffic technology to facilitate relay and double cropping and thus research a cropping system that could exploit late winter crop rainfall. In Field Trial I, grain sorghum and sunflower, broadacre crops already grown within the Southern and Darling Downs regions of Queensland and New South Wales were intercropped into wheat; sunflower was intercropped with wheat in Field Trial II. Sole summer plantings were made at the same time as intercrops were planted. The wheat crop was cut and stubble removed to facilitate this. Various planting dates (three for Field Trial I; four for Field Trial II) for the relayed summer crops were used to determine if an optimum planting time existed. Plant height, tiller number, light interception, grain yield, soil moisture and economic return were used as parameters to compare the intercrop with sole plantings in Field Trial I. Grain yield, soil moisture, rainfall infiltration and economic return were measured in Field Trial II. Research also involved the modification and testing of a tractor to carry out the sowing of the intercrop. In Field Trial I, light interception was shown to vary at different stages of the wheat crop and the use of these stages to determine optimum planting dates of the relay crop is suggested. In both trials, no differences were recorded in the grain yield between intercropped and sole cropped wheat treatments suggesting the trafficking of the plot did not affect the wheat. As neither sorghum or sunflower established as intercrops, competition was not a factor in affecting wheat yields. Moisture readings in both trials showed little change below a depth of 100 cm; however some treatment differences were present at shallower depths. In Field ii Trial I, sole summer sorghum, especially the first planting date, showed reduced water capture/ higher soil evaporation due to wheat removal initially and later transpiration loss due to crop growth and increased weed pressure. Sole wheat treatments showed increased moisture storage after harvest due to lack of water use by the crop and increased infiltration/reduced runoff due to stubble retention. Improved soil moisture recharge after rainfall events was apparent in double cropped treatments suggesting not only improved water utilisation but also improved capture and storage is possible within this system. Sorghum, commonly used throughout south eastern Queensland as a summer crop option, proved unsuitable for relay intercropping in Field Trial I for Planting Dates 1 and 2. Minimum soil temperatures for these plantings were marginal as they were close to the 15o Celsius level recommended for sorghum. However, even though establishment was poor for the intercropped plantings, it was higher for sole sorghum plantings. Wheat allelopathic effects may be involved. To avoid the temperature limitations of sorghum, sunflower was selected as an alternative intercrop in the later planting dates of Field Trial I and all dates for Field Trial II. Reasons for the poor establishment and yield of sunflowers in the earlier intercrop planting dates compared to sole plantings remain unknown but also may be related to allelopathic effects from intercropped wheat. Low soil temperature was not a factor affecting establishment Yields for planting dates were recorded in the intercropped sunflower treatments for Field Trial II and the optimal planting time for sunflowers in a wheat/sunflower relay intercrop was identified as when physiological maturity of the wheat had occurred. This may relate to the wheat crop stage. In Field Trial II, no significant differences in soil moisture were recorded between treatments from overall water use for the trial period. There were differences in water use between intercropped and sole cropped treatments for iii some rainfall events. Three rainfall events were chosen for closer study in each of the field trials conducted. Each event varied in the length and time as well as the duration and intensity of the rain that fell for the period. For the first rainfall period the moisture content of the first planting date of the sole summer treatment and to a lesser extent the second planting date of the same treatment increased, most likely due to wheat removal. In the third rainfall period the double cropped sunflower treatment with stubble tended to store less moisture and this may be due to the active crop growth at this time. It was evident in both field trials of the need for an effective weed control program in the intercrop plots. Weeds were controlled in wheel tracks by glyphosate sprays. Cultural methods may help but a herbicide suitable for both components of the intercrop would be very useful. A tractor was successfully modified to a 3 metre wheelspace and a clearance of 70 cm. This proved sufficient for planting the relay intercrop in Field Trial II without negatively affecting the yield of the standing crop. The row spacing of 18 cm for wheat in a 3 metre fixed bed and wheeltrack configuration assisted with guidance and interplanting of the relay crop. The relay crop was sown as single alternating rows.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">relay intercropping, controlled traffic, wheat, sunflower, sorghum, LER, ATER, CPR, tramlining, reaised beds</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159371</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals.

Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dog-assisted Therapy for Older People with Dementia: A Randomised Controlled Trial in Residential Aged Care Facilities</field><field name="creator">Jacqueline Perkins</field><field name="description">Rapid increases in population ageing and the associated rise in the prevalence of dementia have created many challenges for the care of older people with dementia. As the majority of people now living in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) now have dementia, the need to maximise the quality of life for this group is increasingly recognised. While such issues have attracted research and policy attention in recent years, the evidence base for practice in dementia care is still underdeveloped. The need for more effective therapeutic interventions to improve the quality of life for older people with dementia is recognised, particularly those living in RACFs. The use of pets is one example of recent attempts to help create a more home-like environment and dog therapy is available in many facilities. Well designed research to demonstrate whether it actually has a positive impact on residents&#8217; quality of life is lacking. This study is the first reported randomised controlled trial investigating dog therapy for people with dementia. Fifty-five older people with mild to moderate dementia living in three residential aged care facilities in the Greater Brisbane area participated in this study. The goal was to identify whether dog therapy accrued any benefits to residents&#8217; well being and compare the benefits, if any, with human-only therapy intervention. The main hypothesis was that dog contact delivered in a small group recreational therapy format would have a beneficial effect on the well being of participants. It was additionally hypothesised that prior and current positive relationships with dogs would be related to improved outcomes of dog therapy and support a human-animal bond explanation of relationship development with the therapy dog(s). Participants were randomly assigned into two groups within each facility: The dog therapy group and a human-only therapy group. Session plans were structured according to a recreational therapy format. Three therapy dogs were used (a miniature Poodle, a Staffordshire Terrier and a German Shepherd Dog) with one dog present at any dog therapy session A before-and-after design was used with concealment of participants at allocation. Mixed methods were used including a panel of seven validated psychometric instruments, an observational measure and a series of four novel questionnaires, dogs for older groups with Alzheimer&#8217;s (DOGA), developed de novo specifically to investigate the effects of dog therapy on participants within this study. Measures of mood, quality of life, health and psychosocial functioning, collectively referred to as well-being, detected benefits accruing to dog therapy participants compared with human-only therapy that approached significance (p = .056) with a large effect size (partial eta squared 16.6%). A different measure of mood and apathy showed similar improvement for participants of both therapy types trialed with analyses of a smaller dataset (n = 36) revealing an overall highly significant result (p=.008) and large effect size (partial eta squared = 25.6%) for all participants. To explore the perceptions of care staff to the dog therapy intervention, a self-complete semi-structured questionnaire was completed by a sample of 21 from two of the study facilities. Content analysis revealed that staff overwhelmingly supported dog therapy with a total of 84 comments about benefits and 22 about risks. Responses were categorised and then linked into emergent themes: a temporal dimension, sense of self and increased opportunities for self expression. The opportunity provided by the therapy dog for accessible caring physical contact for participants was identified as important. General recreational therapy goals such as improved mood, reminiscence and increased levels of conversation were reported by staff to continue beyond interventions. The observed risks were: confusion over dog ownership, subsequent worry about losing the dog after sessions, jealousy over the therapy dog and one participant did not enjoy the small group format. Participants described their experiences of contact with the therapy dog as &#8220;like&#8221; above &#8220;attached&#8221;. Personal preference explanations are therefore supported, rather than &#8220;attachment&#8221;, to explain outcomes for participants. This suggests the psychosocial approach has greater relevance here than human-animal bond explanations. Effects of previous dog attachment on outcomes were inconclusive but there was some evidence that participants&#8217; relationship with the therapy dog(s) influenced outcomes, though the nature of that relationship has not been clarified. Recommendations from the study findings are that dog therapy be conducted for people with mild to moderate levels of dementia in groups of 3-11 for a duration of around 10 weeks with sessions for 30 minutes held once or twice weekly and according to a standard format.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Astronaut' wives: Their experiences in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Chang, Man Wai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">160803 Race and Ethnic Relations</field><field name="subject">370100 Sociology</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Women immigrants -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185163</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Communist Party and trade union work in Queensland in the third period: 1928-1935</field><field name="creator">Penrose, Beris Gene</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Communist Party of Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Labor unions and communism -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Depressions -- 1929 -- Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185197</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Refusal to attend school due to separation anxiety and/or school phobia: A Queensland study</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Julia</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1399 Other Education</field><field name="subject">School attendance</field><field name="subject">Separation anxiety in children</field><field name="subject">School phobia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental factors affecting teaching and learning in North Queensland, 1875-1905</field><field name="creator">De Jabrun, Mary</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">330102 History and Philosophy of Education</field><field name="subject">Public schools -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Queensland -- History</field><field name="subject">Queensland -- Social conditions -- 1788-1900</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186226</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An implementation of the parallelism, distribution and nondeterminism of membrane computing models on reconfigurable hardware</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van-Tuong</field><field name="description">Membrane computing investigates models of computation inspired by certain features of biological cells, especially features arising because of the presence of membranes. Because of their inherent large-scale parallelism, membrane computing models (called P systems) can be fully exploited only through the use of a parallel computing platform. However, it is an open question whether it is feasible to develop an efficient and useful parallel computing platform for membrane computing applications. Such a computing platform would significantly outperform equivalent sequential computing platforms while still achieving acceptable scalability, flexibility and extensibility. To move closer to an answer to this question, I have investigated a novel approach to the development of a parallel computing platform for membrane computing applications that has the potential to deliver a good balance between performance, flexibility, scalability and extensibility. This approach involves the use of reconfigurable hardware and an intelligent software component that is able to configure the hardware to suit the specific properties of the P system to be executed. As part of my investigations, I have created a prototype computing platform called Reconfig-P based on the proposed development approach. Reconfig-P is the only existing computing platform for membrane computing applications able to support both system-level and region-level parallelism. Using an intelligent hardware source code generator called P Builder, Reconfig-P is able to realise an input P system as a hardware circuit in various ways, depending on which aspects of P systems the user wishes to emphasise at the implementation level. For example, Reconfig-P can realise a P system in a rule-oriented manner or in a region-oriented manner. P Builder provides a unified implementation framework within which the various implementation strategies can be supported. The basic principles of this framework conform to a novel design pattern called Content-Form-Strategy. The framework seamlessly integrates the currently supported implementation approaches, and facilitates the inclusion of additional implementation strategies and additional P system features. Theoretical and empirical results regarding the execution time performance and hardware resource consumption of Reconfig-P suggest that the proposed development approach is a viable means of attaining a good balance between performance, scalability, flexibility and extensibility. Most of the existing computing platforms for membrane computing applications fail to support nondeterministic object distribution, a key aspect of P systems that presents several interesting implementation challenges. I have devised an efficient algorithm for nondeterministic object distribution that is suitable for implementation in hardware. Experimental results suggest that this algorithm could be incorporated into Reconfig-P without too significantly reducing its performance or efficiency.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN-AUS</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular computers</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary programming (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Adaptive computing systems</field><field name="subject">Computation Theory and Mathematics not elsewhere classified 80299</field><field name="subject">Concurrent Programming 80304</field><field name="subject">Distributed Computing not elsewhere classified 80599</field><field name="subject">membrane computing</field><field name="subject">reconfigurable hardware</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/100802</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:46593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of slender high-strength concrete columns</field><field name="creator">Billinger, Mark P</field><field name="description">Thesis (PhD)--University of South Australia, 1996</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Columns, Concrete</field><field name="subject">High strength concrete</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/81184</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:43254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The magnitude of errors and omissions in bills of quantities leading to variations</field><field name="creator">Choy, Wing Kwong</field><field name="description">Thesis (MAppSc in Building Environment) --University of South Australia, 1991</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buildings</field><field name="subject">Building</field><field name="subject">Construction industry</field><field name="subject">Quantity surveying</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/85206</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health service quality in Australian private sector physiotherapy and chiropratics :</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Saravana</field><field name="description">The decreasing Australian health dollar requires closer scrutiny on what outcome is purchased for it.

During the 1980s a special emphasis was placed on mechanically oscillating planar jets and the possibility to augment thrust of V/STOL aircraft. However, during this time, little attention was paid to the classification of flow regimes, the development of coherent structures or the existence of different regions in the flow within the jet near field. For the present study, a large aspect ratio nozzle was oscillated in the direction transverse to the width of the nozzle in simple harmonic motion. For a constant nozzle height, the stroke length, oscillation frequency and jet velocity were systematically varied. Over 240 flow cases were examined using a novel method of phase-locked flow visualisation. Following an initial analysis of the acquired data, a small subset of flow conditions was selected for further quantitative investigation using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The phase-locked flow visualisation led to the identification and classification of three separate flow regimes, the Base Flow, the Resonant Flow and the Bifurcation Flow Regimes. Each regime is linked to the other regimes by the presence of a small number of repetitive coherent structures in the form of starting and stopping vortices. The analysis revealed a relationship between the stroke-to-nozzle height ratio and the ratio of the forcing frequency to the natural vortex shedding frequency in the planar jet. This directly contradicts the relationship between the Strouhal and Reynolds numbers of the jet that was proposed by previous investigators. Comparison of phase-locked PIV and flow visualisation data confirms both, the validity of the new regime classification and the identification of relevant large-scale structures. Time-averaged vorticity data are also used to further illustrate the differences between the three flow regimes. Investigation of the time-averaged qualitative data for the Base and Resonant Flow Regimes show that three distinct flow regions exist within both regimes. Adjacent to the nozzle is the initial formation region, where all large-scale structures form. This is followed by a coherent near-field region in which the jet exhibits very little spread for both the Base and Resonant Flow Regimes. Within this region no pairing of the large-scale vortices from the opposing sides of the flow can be found. This region is followed by a transition region that is marked by the sudden breakup and dissipation of all visible large-scale coherent structures. The vortex formation distance is then investigated using the available PIV data and compared with the results of previous investigations. The data show that the formation distance depends on the jet velocity, oscillation frequency and the stroke length. The agreement with previous data is poor due to differences in the method of measurement. Quantitative data are also used to investigate the centreline velocity decay in relation to changes of the jet Reynolds number and stroke-to-nozzle height ratio. The results show that the velocity decay rate increases with increasing stroke length as is expected from findings of earlier studies. In addition the centreline velocity decay rates in the mean jet transition region appear to be constant for each stroke length in the cases examined. Finally, conclusions are drawn and recommendations for future work are presented.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jet flow; planar; PIV; flow visualisation; oscillating</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/54150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peer responses to psychologically distressed tertiary students: the detection of distress and the helping behaviours of student colleagues from medicine, compared to psychology, law and mechanical engineering students.</field><field name="creator">Leahy, Catherine</field><field name="description">Medical students experience elevated levels of psychological distress and they are reluctant to seek professional help for mental health problems. They are also reticent to notify authorities about colleagues experiencing psychological distress. Yet, young people are more likely to seek help from peers than from any other source and we know very little about the help that these peers provide to their distressed colleagues. The current research explored medical students&#8217; approaches to colleagues experiencing psychological distress: firstly, to determine whether they notice the distress of colleagues; secondly, to explore what determines consideration to intervene and help colleagues; and thirdly, the range of helping behaviours provided. Comparisons were made with students from other professional tertiary disciplines. Students from all six years of an undergraduate medical course were compared with convenience samples from Psychology, Law and Mechanical Engineering at The University of Adelaide. Students were recruited for one of three studies which employed a variety of measures, including the Kessler Measure of Psychological Distress (K10), a Retrospective Helping Behaviour Instrument (RHBI) and a Hypothetical Helping Behaviour Instrument (HHBI). Psychological distress (as determined by the K10) among the disciplines surveyed (N = 949) was 4.4 times that of age-matched population normative data. Despite this high rate of distress, students consistently rated the distress of their colleagues as significantly lower than the colleagues&#8217; own self ratings. All disciplines were equally inaccurate in detecting the distress of their colleagues. Analysis of hypothetical helping behaviours, in response to a vignette, indicated that medical students offered more help to non-medical students than they did to fellow medical students; however, the quality of help delivered to fellow medical students was superior. Non-medical students offered more help to medical students than they did to students from their own discipline, but the quality of help they offered did not change between the two disciplines. Analysis of the mixed method RHBI indicated that discipline had an effect on the types of help provided to distressed colleagues, the reasons for and for not helping a colleague, and general helping concerns. Three main types of help were provided: social support, academic assistance and therapeutic assistance. Medical students from Year 3 onwards offered a diverse array of helping behaviours, whilst law and mechanical engineering students primarily offered academic support. Help was considered more frequently than it was actually given and reasons for and against providing help were associated with belief or doubt about the benefit of helping, positive or detrimental effects for the helper, the closeness or lack of friendship with the helpee, and confidence to help. This research has improved our understanding of the mechanisms that produce helping behaviour. It has also provided a rich inventory of the type of help offered by the medical students and by other tertiary students. This knowledge is crucial in the development of effective approaches to assisting distressed students, particularly in regards to the theoretical and practical development of peer support programmes. Peer support programmes take into account young peoples&#8217; preferences to speak to peers. Peer support programmes that build on the students&#8217; existing behaviours and resources (those behaviours identified in this research) have an increased chance of acceptance and validity. Such programmes may offer a viable adjunct to formal support services and, more importantly, may have far reaching effects in breaking down the stigma of mental health problems within professions such as Medicine.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">student distress; helping behaviours; peer support; mental health</field><field name="subject">Peer counseling of students.</field><field name="subject">College students Mental health.</field><field name="subject">College students Psychology</field><field name="subject">Stress, Psychological.</field><field name="subject">Medical students.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Park, hill migration and changes in household livelihood systems of Rana Tharus in Far-western Nepal.</field><field name="creator">Lam, Lai Ming</field><field name="description">Despite the fact that conservation ideology has led conservation practice over the last quarter of a century, the removal of local residents from protected areas in the name of biological preservation remains the most common strategy in developing countries. Its wide-ranging impacts on displaced societies have rarely been properly addressed, particularly in regard to the establishment of parks. This thesis is based on 15 months fieldwork carried out among a group of displaced park residents known as Rana Tharus in the country of Nepal. They have long lived in Royal Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve in the far-western part of that nation. This thesis is largely inspired by recent academic advocacy that conservation-induced dislocations on rural communities are having a serious influence on policy implementation. Such advocacy is leading to more effective and pragmatic park policies. West, Igoe and Brockington (2006) point out that park residents are an indispensable part of protected areas and their cultural and economic interactions with parks occur in diverse ways. Without a full understanding of these interrelationships, any kind of forced conservation policies will be doomed to fail and cause severe disturbances to people&#8217;s lives. Like most protected areas in developing countries, this thesis shows that the unplanned resettlement scheme of Shulkaphanta failed to mitigate the socio-economic losses that Rana Tharus experienced due to their displacement. The ethnographic data notes that when attention is paid solely to the economic losses experienced by Rana Tharus, the social costs such as social exclusion, loss of culture, and psychological depression are rarely addressed in the dislocation program. An inadequate understanding of the links between protected areas and local livelihoods is one of the major causes for the continuation of park-people conflicts including Shuklaphanta. In this thesis, I demonstrate how the displacement and other social changes have gradually diminished the social and economic livelihoods of the Rana people. I argue that many of these social impacts were unexpected because Rana Tharus actively responded to all these changes by putting new social relations into effect. As a result, significant social transformations have occurred in contemporary Rana Tharu society. The undivided household unit was no longer their first preference when the new economic realities made themselves felt, and gender and patrilineal kin relationships became more tense. The traditional labouring system (Kamaiya) that existed between wealthy and poor Rana Tharus declined due to increasing poverty. All these had erased their ability to maintain sustainable livelihoods that they had previously enjoyed. Moreover, substantial loss of landownership had made it impossible for Rana Tharus to share equal social, economic and political status with the new migrants - the twice-born Pahaaris. These accumulated and unforseen results of conservation practices can only be well understood if a holistic analytical perspective is adopted. This thesis borrows the concept of sustainable household livelihood system and the social theories of practice, power and agency to explore the dynamic relationships between conservation, local livelihoods and culture. The stories told by the Rana Tharu provide some important lessons. I argue that dislocation programs should be put aside or at least closely reviewed if their hidden social impacts are not well understood or at least lead to some form of compensation. Such action may prevent the further expansion of park-people conflicts which are shown to hinder conservation efforts of Shuklaphanta and local sustainable livelihoods.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nepal; Conservation; Livelihood</field><field name="subject">Nepal Social conditions 21st century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of a naturally oscillating triangular-jet flow.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Soon-Kong</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on the structure of the flow inside a nozzle which produces a naturally oscillating jet flow. The nozzle consists of a short cylindrical chamber with a concentric triangular-inlet orifice at one end and a circular exit lip at the other end. This triangular-jet nozzle was developed from the &#8220;fluidic-precessing-jet&#8221; (FPJ) nozzle, which has a similar arrangement of components, but has a circular rather than a triangular inlet. For reliably oscillating flow, the FPJ nozzle should have an inlet-to-chamber expansion ratio of at least 5.0, a chamber lengthto- diameter ratio between 2.6 and 2.8, and an exit-lip height of about 0.1 chamber diameters. The triangular-jet nozzle produces a continuously and aperiodically oscillating jet flow which is different from the FPJ flow. The oscillation occurs at smaller inlet-to-chamber expansion ratios (2.1 &#8818; D /de&#8321; &#8818; 3.5) and over a wider range of chamber lengths (2.0 &#8818; L /D &#8818; 2.5). The initial spreading angle of the jet flow is smaller, but is still much larger than that of non-oscillating, axisymmetric turbulent-jet flows. In addition, the external &#8220;oscillating-triangular-jet&#8221; (OTJ) flow has preferred azimuthal directions which are aligned with the three corners of the orifice. The kinetic-energy-loss coefficient of the OTJ nozzle is much smaller than that of the FPJ nozzle because oscillation occurs at much smaller inlet-to-chamber expansion ratios. For a narrow range of length-to-diameter ratios (1.00 &#8818; L/D &#8818; 1.25), the triangular-inlet nozzle can also produce a non-oscillating or &#8220;stationary deflected triangular jet&#8221; (SDTJ) which reattaches asymmetrically to the inside surface of the cylindrical chamber. The SDTJ has a weak tendency to oscillate, which suggests that flow patterns required for self-excited oscillation are already present in the SDTJ flow. Surface-flow visualisation and surface-pressure measurements in the SDTJ nozzle have provided the location of critical points and bifurcation lines on the chamber wall, and from this the topology of the SDTJ flow is deduced. Some details of the flow such as a jet-reattachment node near the chamber exit and a strong swirl adjacent to the inlet orifice are known from previous studies of the FPJ flow, but there are many newly observed features. The most easily identified of these are two sink-focus separation points, one on each side of the reattachment node but closer to the inlet plane. The foci counter rotate and are of unequal size. Reverse flow through the exit plane of the chamber is attracted to the larger focus. The vortex core rising from each focus is entrained by the reattaching-jet (SDTJ) flow and is drawn out of the chamber. A backward-facing pressure probe placed in the OTJ &#8220;reattaching-flow&#8221; region of chamber wall can be used as a reliable detector of jet-flow oscillation. Cross-correlating the signal from this detector probe with simultaneous static-pressure measurements elsewhere on the chamber wall gives a conditionally-averaged pressure on the wall of the OTJ chamber. The OTJ wall-pressure distribution has the same features as the SDTJ surface-pressure distribution, but it has greater asymmetry about a mirror plane drawn through the chamber axis and the detector probe. An array of three backward-facing pressure probes has been used as an &#8220;event detector&#8221; for conditionally-sampled (PIV) measurements of non-axial velocity components in cross-sections of the OTJ nozzle. The event-detection scheme responds only to a preselected (counter-clockwise) direction of motion of the oscillating-jet flow. The streamline patterns constructed from the conditionally-sampled measurements confirm the presence of the jet-reattachment node, the swirl and the sink foci identified from the SDTJ surface-flow visualisation. The shear-layer interaction between the jet from the triangular orifice and the swirl (adjacent to the inlet plane) produces strong longitudinal vortices in the ensemble-averaged flow. The jet flow distributes these vortices through the length of the chamber. Vortex cores representing the vortices are reconstructed by tracking streamline foci from one PIV cross-section plane to another. The tracking process includes the connection and termination of vortex cores in a manner which is consistent with the Helmholtz vortex law. In this flow field, the vortex core produced by the swirl and the vortex core rising from the larger sink-focus vortex on the chamber wall are connected to form a loop. The extent to which this vortex loop is contained within the chamber determines whether or not the flow is oscillating. If only a small fraction (e.g. 8%) of the vortex circulation passes through the exit plane of the nozzle, the loop is trapped inside the chamber and the deflected jet oscillates. If the length of the chamber is halved, about 35% of vortex circulation escapes from the nozzle and the oscillation stops.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Triangular orifice; oscillating jet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio propagation in fire environments.</field><field name="creator">Boan, Jonathan Alexander</field><field name="description">Radio propagation in the presence of fire is known to be problematic to communications. In this thesis we use both experimental and theoretical approaches to examine and understand radio propagation in fire environments. Propagation is examined for three small scale fires with broadband equipment operating from 50MHz to 1GHz. Results for line of sight propagation show a strong interaction of fire with electromagnetic propagation. The next section develops electromagnetic modelling of the fire environment. A model of the combustion induced plasma is developed, as well as a refractive index model of the surrounding atmosphere of a fire. Simple propagation calculations are undertaken, using the developed fire models, to provide an intial understanding of propagation in fire environments. The next portion of the thesis considers propagation using a more rigorous electromagnetic simulation technique. A modified Finite Difference Time Domain method is presented and is utilised to examine three dimensional propagation in the small scale fire experiments. The outcome is a more solid understanding of propagation and the contributing factors. The last portion of the thesis is the application of the above electromagnetic modelling and simulation methods to bushfire scenarios. Various scenarios that are problematic to radio communication are examined. Discussion and recommendations are made concerning radio communication frequency selection and considerations for propagation in fire environments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio propagation; fire; wildfire; bushfire; FDTD</field><field name="subject">Radio in fire prevention.</field><field name="subject">Fire departments Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Forest fires Prevention and control Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulatory T cells, Th17 effector cells and cytokine microenvironment in inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac disease.</field><field name="creator">Eastaff-Leung, Nicola</field><field name="description">Inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis) and coeliac disease are debilitating gastrointestinal diseases that seriously affect the quality of life of those affected. Under normal circumstances, the intestinal immune system is maintained in a state of controlled inflammation, whereby balance exists between protective immunity, mediated by effector cells, and tolerance mediated by cells with regulatory function. However, an aberrant immune response is believed to contribute to the intestinal inflammation present in individuals afflicted by these diseases. This thesis investigated the involvement of CD4&#8314; CD25[superscript]high Foxp3&#8314; Regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th17 Effector cells in both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and coeliac disease. The reciprocal relationship between Treg and Th17 cells under certain cytokine conditions, has prompted the exploration of these two cell types in IBD and coeliac disease. Previous studies have examined these factors individually in a range of diseases, however, to our knowledge the study of both Treg and Th17 in IBD and coeliac disease subjects represents a novel area of research. Crohn&#8217;s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and coeliac disease subjects were recruited through the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at The Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QEH) in Adelaide, South Australia. In total, one-hundred and seventeen subjects were enlisted in this study to donate blood samples. In addtion, intestinal biopsy samples were collected from fifty-six subjects undergoing colonoscopy at the QEH Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology. All subjects participated, with informed consent and ethics approval. Treg and Th17 cell numbers were investigated in the peripheral blood of Crohn&#8217;s disease, ulcerative colitis, coeliac disease and control subjects using multi-colour, intracellular flow cytometry. A decrease in Treg cell numbers and an increase in Th17 cell numbers was observed in IBD, but not in coeliac disease. Closer investigation into the ratio of Treg and Th17 cells within patients identified a near 1:1 Treg/Th17 ratio in control subjects, but a lower Treg/Th17 ratio in IBD patients. This suggested a disturbance in regulatory and effector cell equilibrium. Furthermore, the excess of Th17 cells and deficiency of Tregs could contribute to the pathologies observed in IBD. The discovery of an imbalance in Treg and Th17 cell numbers in IBD prompted further investigation of these cells in intestinal biopsies collected from IBD, coeliac and control subjects. Real time RT-PCR of intestinal biopsy samples demonstrated increased expression of the Th17 cytokine, IL-17a, in both IBD and coeliac disease. Elevated levels of the Treg transcription factor Foxp3 were also identified in intestinal biopsies from IBD subjects. It was therefore hypothesised that Treg cells may have been actively recruited from the periphery in an attempt to control inflammation in the gut; however, the intestinal cytokine microenvironment may have restricted the regulatory function of these cells. Cytokines known to promote human Th17 differentiation, namely IL-1&#946;, IL-6, TGF-&#946;, IL-21 and IL-23, were explored in intestinal biopsy samples from IBD, coeliac and control subjects. High levels of IL-1&#946; and IL-6 were detected in IBD patient samples, however, no change in levels of IL-21 or IL-23 were observed in IBD or coeliac disease subjects. Elevated levels of TGF-&#946; were only identified in UC. No changes in cytokine expression were observed between control and coeliac subjects, except a significant decrease in IL-6 levels was identified in coeliac disease sufferers. The pro-inflammatory microenvironment identified in intestinal biopsies from IBD subjects may have promoted the continual differentiation and development of Th17 cells, whilst restricting Treg activity. Moreover, the observed deficiency of Treg in IBD patients may have impaired the ability of the immune system to limit excessive pathogenic Th17 driven immune responses in the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, therapeutic approaches that aim to re-establish regulatory and effector cell homeostasis by increasing Treg numbers in IBD patients, and specifically targeting Th17 cells, may prove effective in the treatment of IBD. Approaches such as these could provide greater focus to treatment strategies for IBD management compared to current broad-spectrum immunosuppressive therapies that could increase susceptibility to cancer or infection in IBD patients. In addition, the imbalance of regulatory and effector cells demonstrated in the peripheral blood of IBD patients may potentially provide new options for a noninvasive diagnostic tool.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regulatory T cells; Th17 effector cells; imflammatory bowel disease; coeliac disease</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel diseases</field><field name="subject">Crohn's disease.</field><field name="subject">Celiac disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the temporal release of atomic sodium during a burning black liquor droplet using quantitative planar laser-induced fluorescene (PLIF).</field><field name="creator">Saw, Woei Lean</field><field name="description">The release of sodium during the combustion of black liquor is a significant source of fume formation in a kraft recovery boiler, affecting efficiency in a pulp and paper mill. The fume is deposited on the surface of heat exchanger tubes in the upper furnace, causing fouling and corrosion, especially to the superheaters. This thesis reports on work done to develop improved understanding of fume formation. The mechanisms of sodium release during each stage of black liquor combustion are influenced by the surface temperature. The addition of boron to the black liquor, which debottlenecks the recausticizing plant by a reduction in lime usage, also influences the characteristics of black liquor combustion, such as combustion time and swelling. Previously, no effective measurement technique has been available to quantify sodium concentration in the plume of a burning black liquor droplet with or without boron, or to record the distribution of surface temperature through the time history of a burning droplet. This thesis reports on the adaptation of two techniques for the measurement of the release of atomic sodium and the temperature history, and their application to investigate several aspects of the release of atomic sodium during combustion of black liquor in a flat flame environment. The simultaneous employment of a planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique with an absorption technique has been adapted to allow quantitative measurement of the release of atomic sodium. The absorption technique has been employed to correct for both fluorescence trapping due to absorption and attenuation by high concentration of the atomic sodium in the plume, and for collisional quenching by the other major gas components present in the flat flame. An independent assessment was performed using kinetic calculations, based on measured total sodium that is residual in a particle obtained at different stages in the combustion process. These independent assessments were used to provide greater insight in to the release process and to cross-check. The influence of both the initial diameter of the droplet and addition of boron to the black liquor on the temporal release and the release rate of atomic sodium during the combustion have been performed using the present PLIF technique. The second technique, two-dimensional two-colour optical pyrometry, has been adapted to measure the distribution of surface temperature and the swelling (change in surface area) of a burning black liquor droplet. The influence of surface temperature or the change in the external surface area of the droplet on the release of atomic sodium during the combustion of black liquor has been assessed through concurrent use of both adapted techniques. The highest concentration of atomic sodium was measured in the final stage of combustion that of smelt coalescence, where it is an order of magnitude greater than in the other stages combined. While the extensive release of atomic sodium at high temperature in this final combustion stage occurs in only a relatively small percentage of droplets in a kraft recovery boiler, the effect could still be significant in fume formation. This is because the extensive release is expected to occur in the very small droplets, predominantly generated by splitting or physical ejection. Small droplets will have a very short combustion time and so could remain in suspension within hot gases for sufficient time for extensive release of sodium. These measurements outcomes can be used to support the future development of sub-models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models in order to better understand and optimise fume formation in a kraft recovery boiler.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Black liquor; LIF; sodium; surface temperature; boron</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of jet precession on particle distributions.</field><field name="creator">Birzer, Cristian Heinrich</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the extent to which jet precession can be used to control the mean and instantaneous particle distributions in particle-laden jet flows. Investigations were conducted, providing quantitative, planar measurements of instantaneous particle distributions in the first 10 nozzle diameters of a particle-laden co-annular nozzle with centrally located Precessing Jet (PJ). Equipment was specifically designed to conduct the investigations, a laser diagnostic technique developed and a methodology to quantify particle clusters was devised. The experimental facilities are scaled to simulate the near burner region of a typical rotary cement kiln. The laser diagnostic technique, called planar nephelometry, enables non-intrusive, quantitative, instantaneous, planar measurements of particle distributions without the need to identify individual particles. The methodology to quantify particle clusters is designed to enable statistical comparison of clusters without ambiguity. Measurements of the influence of particle mass loading and jet precession on the distribution of particles emerging from an particle-laden co-annular nozzle, with a centrally located PJ nozzle, are presented. These data include mean and standard deviation of the particle distributions and statistics on particle cluster characteristics. The results indicate that small amounts of momentum through the PJ nozzle causes an elongation of the jet, but larger amounts of momentum through the PJ nozzle will result in a wider mean particle distribution and greater mean centreline decay rate. An increase in jet precession also results in an increase in the fluctuations in the particle distributions. The transition is determined by the interplay of momentum of the particle-laden and precessing streams. The physical characteristics of identified particle clusters in the instantaneous planar flow field are also influenced by jet precession. An initial increase in the amount of jet precession results in an overall decrease in the average number of both small- and large-clusters. The size of small-clusters generally reduces with increasing jet precession, whereas large-clusters reach maximum sizes for an intermediate relative momentum of jet precession. Analogous to the influence of jet precession on the mean distribution of particles, increasing jet precession also results in a greater spread of small- and large-clusters. Results also indicate that increasing the mass flow rate of particles results in an elongation of the jet. However, these variations correspond to an increase in annular jet momentum, rather than an addition of secondary phase. The particle mass flow rate has a minor influence on the general characteristics of particle clusters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jet precession; two-phase flows; laser diagnostics; particle clusters</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing the "perfect" voyage: Nicolas Baudin at Port Jackson, 1802.</field><field name="creator">Starbuck, Nicole</field><field name="description">In 1802, a French scientific expedition under the command of Nicolas Baudin made an uscheduled visit to the British colony at Port Jackson, New South Wales. It was a pivotal episode in the course of Baudin's Australian voyage. The commander had already fulfilled most of his instructions, though imperfectly, and only the north coast of New Holland remained unexamined. He and his men stayed at anchor in Port Jackson for over five months. When they set sail once more, they embarked on what historians agree was a new phase of the expedition. Baudin and his men did not proceed directly to the north coast, but returned to the southern and western coasts, where they perfected and augmented the work in geography and natural history that they had carried out earlier. This thesis examines what occurred during the sojourn at Port Jackson, as well as the circumstances that led up to it, in order to determine in precise terms why and how this episode came to be a turning point in Baudin's voyage. It asks: was the second campaign just an extension of the first or was it an opportunity for Baudin to redefine the voyage? The Port Jackson sojourn thus serves as a site of interrogation regarding the nature of Nicolas Baudin's leadership and the construction, on British colonial territory, of a French scientific voyage. However, the opportunity to gain real insight into the sojourn of the voyagers at Port Jackson has been limited by a perceived scarcity of resources. The fact that Baudin's journal falls silent here has meant that there is no one privileged source of information on the commander's role or on the day-to-day activities of the expeditioners, and that scholars examining this episode have tended to focus on the details of the larger picture rather than on the larger picture itself. This is not to say that the presence of the Baudin expedition in Port Jackson has left no material traces. In fact, there is a diverse range of archival records &#8211; expense accounts, correspondence, inventories of specimens, journals kept by officers and savants and the logbooks of the G&#233;ographe &#8211; from which the day-to-day life of the commander and his men at Port Jackson can be reconstructed. Commencing with an analysis of the events that led up to the sojourn and influenced Baudin's approach to it, this study examines the relationships that Baudin built in the colony, his manner of command aboard the G&#233;ographe and the scientific results of the stay. After then analysing the way in which Baudin managed the sojourn and planned the second campaign, we conclude that Baudin did not simply seek to satisfy the expectations of his superiors but in fact he seized this opportunity to create the &#8220;perfect&#8221; scientific voyage.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Baudin; Australian exploration; Australian history; French history; explorers; science and discovery</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Total synthesis of ancistrotanzanine A.</field><field name="creator">Brusnahan, Jason Stewart</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the first total synthesis of ancistrotanzanine A, a member of the naphthylisoquinoline class of natural products. In Chapter 1 the synthetic challenges presented by the naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids are discussed and strategies that have been adopted in previous syntheses of naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids overviewed. Chapter 2 describes the preparation of the key 5,3'-biaryl linkage via the Pinhey-Barton reaction. Studies into forming the linkage atropselectively were investigated using chiral hydrobenzoin acetal auxiliaries. This was found to have limited success with an atropisomeric ratio of 65:35 obtained. Changing the base from the achiral pyridine to the chiral brucine was also investigated and found to give no enhancement in the diastereoselectivity. From the results presented in Chapter 2, it was concluded that hydrobenzoin acetal auxiliaries were not appropriate for the diastereoselective synthesis of the key biaryl linkage of ancistrotanzanine A. As the chiral acetal strategy outlined in Chapter 2 failed to yield an atropselective process, efforts were re-focused on a new approach to the naphthylisoquinolines. In Chapter 3, an overview of all the methods available for the synthesis of chiral 3,4-dihydroisoquinolines is provided. From this, it was decided to apply the alkylation of o-tolylnitriles with chiral sulfinimines, as originally developed by Davis, to the synthesis of naphthylisoquinolines. Synthesis of the o-tolylnitrile lead reagent was readily achieved, but it was found that the amount of lead tetraacetate had to be carefully controlled to avoid side-reactions in the Pinhey-Barton reaction. After careful optimisation, the key 5,3'-biaryl linkage was prepared in high yield. Application of the Davis methodology to the MOM protected biaryl failed, with no reaction resulting. After much experimentation, it was established that the reaction was very sensitive to steric hindrance. A successful reaction was finally achieved by changing the base to lithium diethylamide. However, it was found the diastereoselection of the alkylation was quite low when p-tolyl sulfinimine was used. The use of the t-butane sulfinimine meant that the diastereoselection was significantly improved, with a ratio of 85:15 being obtained. After 3 more steps, the total synthesis was completed and ancistrotanzanine A was obtained, as a 1:1 mixture of atropisomers. Efforts to separate the atropisomers formed failed and even the use of chiral HPLC failed to resolve the material. To complete the Chapter, two analogues of ancistrotanzanine A were prepared &#8211; the tetrahydroisoquinoline and the methoxy ether. Chapter 4 summarises the above results and discusses the future potential of this research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids; isoquinoline; natural products; atropisomers; biaryl</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal designs for two-colour microarray experiments.</field><field name="creator">Sanchez, Penny S.</field><field name="description">My PhD research focuses on the recommendation of optimal designs for two-colour microarray experiments. Two-colour microarrays are a technology used to investigate the behaviour of many thousands of genes in a single experiment. This technology has created the potential for making significant advances in the field of bioinformatics. Careful statistical design is crucial to realize the full potential of microarray technology. My research has focused on the recommendation of designs that are optimal in terms of precision for effects that are of scientific interest, making the most effective use of available resources. Based on statistical efficiency, the optimality criterion used is Pareto optimality. A design is defined to be Pareto optimal if there is no other design that leads to equal or greater precision for each effect of scientific interest and strictly greater precision for at least one. My PhD thesis was submitted in June and key aspects of my research are summarised below. Pareto optimality enables the recommendation of designs that are particularly efficient for the effects that are of scientific interest. I have developed methodology to cater for effects of interest that correspond to contrasts rather than solely considering parameters of the statistical linear model. My approach also caters for additional experimental considerations such as contrasts that are of equal scientific interest. During my PhD, I have provided advice regarding the design of two-colour microarray experiments aimed at discovering the genetic basis of medical conditions. For large experiments, it is not feasible to examine all possible designs in an exhaustive search for Pareto optimal designs. I have adapted the multiple objective metaheuristic method of Pareto simulated annealing to the microarray context. The aim of Pareto simulated annealing is to generate an approximation to the set of Pareto optimal designs in a relatively short time. At each iteration, a sample of generating designs is used to explore the design space in an efficient way. This involves the setting of a number of Pareto simulated annealing parameters and the development of appropriate quality measures. I have developed algorithms to search systematically for the optimal values of the tuning parameters based on Pareto simulated annealing and response surface methodology.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">factorial experiments; microarrays; optimal experimental design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface reconstruction from three dimensional range data.</field><field name="creator">Myers, Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the problem of reconstructing a single surface representation from multiple range images acquired from a terrestrial laser scanner. A solution to this problem is important to industries such as mining, where accurate spatial measurement is required for mapping and volumetric calculations. Laser scanners for 3D measurement are now commercially available and software for deriving useful information from the data these devices generate is essential. A reconstruction technique based on an implicit surface representation of the range images and a polygonisation algorithm called marching triangles has been implemented in software and its performance investigated. This work improves upon the existing techniques in that it takes into account the particular differences of terrestrial range data as compared with data from small scale laser scanners. The implementation is robust with respect to noisy data and environments and requires minimal user input. A new approach to 3D spatial indexing is also developed to allow rapid evaluation of the true closest point to a surface which is the basis of the signed distance function implicit surface representation. A new technique for locating step discontinuities in the range image is presented, which caters for the varying sampling densities of terrestrial range images. The algorithm is demonstrated using representative range images acquired for surface erosion monitoring and for underground mine surveying. The results indicate that this reconstruction technique represents an improvement over current techniques for this type of range data.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spatial indexing, marching triangles algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/60144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Negative masking and the units problem in audition</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Daniel</field><field name="description">For humans with adequately operating auditory systems the arrival of acoustic waves to the ear and the subsequent displacement of the tympanic membrane gives rise to the sensations and perceptions commonly known as hearing. One aspect of hearing is loudness, to which the field of psychophysics attempts to ascribe a physical correlate intrinsic to the incoming acoustic wave. For over 50 years psychophysicists have attempted to explicitly define the just-noticeable difference (JND) for loudness: the smallest amount, in physical units, that a stimulus needs to be increased to produce a perceptual difference. A review of the literature suggests that the problem in defining the JND is twofold. Firstly there is the measurement problem, with specific weighting on two competing measures of the JND: the level difference (&#916;L) vs. the Weber fraction (&#916;X/X). Deciding between the two measures has proved difficult: within the natural operating range of the auditory system the two measures are directly proportional to one another. Secondly there is the units problem, concerned with the physical unit in which the measure should be expressed. The units problem exists because it has yet to be determined which property of the acoustic stimulus accounts for the perception of loudness. There are several candidates: acoustic pressure (p); acoustic intensity (I); acoustic power (P), and acoustic energy (E). The necessity of determining which, if any, is the proper measure of the stimulus is forced by the phenomenon of negative masking, which is manifest when the stimulus is expressed in terms of pressure. Selecting among the various quantities is complicated by the fact that the four measures are linearly related and constitute a direct transformation of one another. In the laboratory context existing techniques can produce stimuli that severely challenge the auditory system and break down the proportionality exhibited by the various candidate JNDs. These techniques however require greater scrutiny and development. Buus and Florentine (1991) have proposed that the JND measure (i.e., &#916;p/p, &#916;I/I, &#916;L) that realizes a linear relationship with the detectability index, d&#8217;, is the correct measure. The proportionality of the measures makes such comparison complicated, and threshold values need to be inflated by manipulating stimulus parameters in order to exceed the range of proportionality. This is accomplished using short duration (10-ms) sinusoids and low level masking noise. The experimental program commenced with a series of negative masking experiments to ensure the phenomenon is still relevant to short duration stimuli. Laming&#8217;s (1986) sensory analytical model, which assumes the auditory system responds to pressure, provided an acceptable fit to these data. Experiments on the pedestal effect, a related phenomenon, generated fixed-increment functions that could be compared to the masking functions generated from the negative masking data. A consistent relationship between the two was found when the stimuli were expressed in units of pressure. Attention then turned to improving the studies undertaken by Buus and Florentine (1991) to determine what the proper measure of the JND should be. A series of experiments, differentiated by stimulus conditions, suggest a JND measure expressed in pressure units had the most linear relationship with d&#8217;. The results argue for pressure as the correct measure of the stimulus, and &#916;p/p to be the most qualified representative of the JND.

J.</field><field name="description">Developer interactions with robots during the testing and debugging phases of robot development are more complex than and distinct from general software application development. One of the primary differences is the need to understand the robot's view of the environment and the inconsistencies between this and the actual environment. Augmented reality (AR) provides an ideal way to achieve this, allowing robot program data to be displayed in context with the real world. This allows for easy comparison by the developer, highlighting the cause for any bugs in the robot behaviour. An AR debugging space is created in this work that allows the developer to have this enhanced understanding of the robot's world-view, thus improving developer efficiency.  Over the past decade robots have begun to move out of industrial assembly lines and into environments that must be shared with human users. Many of the tasks that we wish robots to perform in these environments require close interaction and collaboration with human users. The move away from the constrained environment of a production line means that the tasks required of robots are more varied, their operating environment is far more complex and unpredictable, and safety can no longer be achieved through isolation of the robot. The result of these influences has been to change robot programming from a simple task of instructing the robot to perform a sequence of steps to an open ended challenge of specifying dynamic interactions that robot developers are still coming to terms with. Robot development is more than just design and code entry and a broader approach to improving robot development is needed. One of the founding principles of this thesis is that robot development should be approached as a human-robot interaction issue, this particularly applies to the testing and debugging phases of the development.  The nature of the robot platform, the tasks the robot is required to perform and the environments that robots work within are significantly different from those of the desktop application. Hence robot developers need a tailored tool chain that focuses on this unique combination of issues. Current robot programming research is dominated by robot APIs and frameworks, leaving support tools to be developed in an ad hoc manner by developers as features are required. This leads to disjointed tools that have minimal feature sets; tools that generally have poor portability when applied to other robot developments. This work examines the needs of the developer in terms of a general purpose robot visualisation tool.  One of the fundamental requirements of a general purpose robot visualisation tool is that a set of stock visualisations must be available for the developer. A prerequisite to providing these is to have a set of standard interfaces to provide the visualisations for. The open source robot framework Player/Stage was used throughout this work to provide standardised access to robot hardware. As part of this research the author has contributed heavily to the Player/Stage project, particularly as one of the key developers of the 2.0 release of Player. This new release simplifies Player development and increases the ease of maintenance of Player drivers and the efficiency of the server core.  To evaluate the benefits of AR visualisation an intelligent debugging space was developed, which runs as a permanent installation in a robotic development lab providing an enhanced view of the robot's behaviour to the developer. The space is capable of automatically detecting the presence of robots and displaying visualisations of the standard interfaces of the robot, such as its sensors and effectors. The debugging space also allows the developer to create custom renderings, leveraging the developer's ability to determine the most salient items of their code and display these.  A set of representative case studies was carried out using the debugging space for testing and debugging. These studies showed that AR provides an opportunity to understand the type of errors that are encountered during debugging. Debugging is essentially a process of elimination and by understanding the type of error developers can quickly eliminate large sets of potential bug sources, focusing on the sections of code that are causing the bug and therefore substantially reducing debugging time. The implemented system also shows that AR provides an important stepping stone between simulation environments and the real world.  This thesis contributes the novel approach of applying AR to developer interactions with robots. The use of AR has been shown to have significant benefits for the robot developer, enhancing their understanding of the robot's world-view and hence reducing debugging time. As part of the work a flexible AR visualisation tool was developed with close integration to the Player/Stage project. This tool creates an intelligent debugging space where developers can exploit the benefits of the AR visualisation with minimal overhead.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robotics</field><field name="subject">Augmented Reality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of an annealing furnace</field><field name="creator">Depree, Nicholas Brian</field><field name="description">The metal coating line at New Zealand Steel relies on a large electric radiant furnace to  heat steel strip before hot-dip galvanising in a continuous process. The temperature evolution  of the strip inside the furnace is vital in ensuring the speci ed mechanical properties  are achieved for a range of steel products. Ductile products require high temperatures  su cient to cause recrystallisation of the steel microstructure, while stronger products  must be heated without causing recrystallisation. Strip dimensions and desired properties  are changed often and irregularly during operation, and these changes and associated  furnace control actions cause changes in furnace and strip temperatures and rate of heat  transfer over several di erent time scales.  Accurate control of temperature is di cult because temperature measurement devices  are strongly a ected by re ected radiation in the furnace cavity. The furnace is often  operating during transient temperature conditions, as control actions take e ect very  slowly compared to the the rate of change of operational targets. Understanding of the  transient behaviour of this system of interrelated, nonlinear variables can be improved  using modelling to calculate furnace and strip temperatures as a result of control actions  in real time, which cannot otherwise be measured or predicted.  It is shown that a three-dimensional model is capable of accurately calculating furnace  temperatures changing over both time and location, requiring minimal simpli cation of  the physical system, but is computationally expensive. Radiative heat exchange in the  furnace cavity causes signi cantly increased temperature along the edges of the steel strip,  which can cause reject product due to localised softening. It was found that furnace thermocouples  are strongly a ected by re ected radiation, so that furnace wall temperatures  be may signi cantly hotter than measured.  A simpli ed, coupled temperature-metallurgical model was shown to accurately calcui  late both furnace and strip temperatures and metallurgical changes, while the 3D model  provides understanding of e ects not explicitly modelled in the simpli ed model. The  simpli ed model is used for optimisation of furnace operational parameters, to improve  plant throughput and energy e ciency while maintaining desired metallurgical properties,  which is demonstrated by application to common products at NZ Steel.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated waste management</field><field name="creator">Seadon, Jeffrey Keith</field><field name="description">Integrated waste management is considered from a systems&#8217; approach, with a  particular emphasis on advancing sustainability. The focus of the thesis is to  examine the various subsystems as they apply in a New Zealand context and  to scrutinize the developments of these subsystems in a time where there has  been a renewed worldwide interest in sustainability.  Fonterra is evaluated as a prime industry example along with the Ministry for  the Environment as the government representative. Both Fonterra and the  government have made some progress in addressing the problem of waste  and so far they have followed a similar path as their sectors worldwide in that  they have addressed parts of the waste issue but not as an ongoing and  systematic approach to provide a sustainable solution to waste.  The initial aim was to investigate the current state of practice to gain an  insight into the integration of waste management. Research into the relevant  literature along with a combination of data collection and interviews were  organised with practitioners and stakeholders from Fonterra, the Ministry for  the Environment, local government waste officials, local and central  government politicians, consultants and non-governmental organisations.  The thesis identifies pockets of an integrated approach to waste management  internationally and even some elements of a systems approach. The path to  an integrated approach usually starts with a simple framework like a waste  management hierarchy operating in one medium and progresses to multiple  media. A range of existing tools provides the flexibility for a systems approach  focusing on the processes that increase resource efficiency. The use of  leverage points at opportune times can enable substantial improvements in a  waste management system that provides opportunities for ongoing systems  based integration and the saving of both money and resources.  Additionally, integrated waste management systems require agents including  site managers, company head office, councils, central government and the  community to work together in a cooperative, transparent and coordinated  manner. The thesis has provided a way forward to move towards  sustainability through an integrated approach to waste management.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5862</field></doc></add>
