(We use the terms adaptive and reconfigurable interchangeably). Here, an adaptive computer is a computing system that contains a general purpose processor attached to a programmable logic device such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA). These computing systems combine the flexibility of general purpose processors with the speed of application specific processors. The computer system designer can cater the hardware to a specific application by modifying the configuration of the FPGAs. The designer can reconfigure the FPGAs at some future time for other applications since the FPGAs do not have a fixed structure.Several reconfigurable computers have been implemented to demonstrate the viability of reconfigurable processors.Applications mapped to these processors include pattern recognition in high-energy physics, statistical physics and genetic optimization algorithms. In many cases, the reconfigurable computing implementation provided thehighest performance, in terms of execution speed, published (at the respective time).To achieve such performance, the application must effectively utilize the available resources. This presents a challenge for software designers, who are generally used to mapping applications onto fixed computing systems.Generally, the designers examine the available hardware resources and modify their application accordingly. With reconfigurable computers, the available resources can be generated when needed. While it may seem thatthis flexibility would ease the mapping process, it actually introduces new problems, such as what components should be allocated, and how many of each component should be used to generate the best performance. With conventionalhardware components, these questions were not an issue.In addition, software engineers are generally not adept at hardware design.In this dissertation, we present a design methodology for systematically implementing computationally intense applications on reconfigurable computing systems. This methodology is based on concepts from compiler theory to ease automation.In addition to the design methodology, we present, a toolthat implements a significant portion of the design methodology. RAS can be considered as a module generation tool for assisting the design process. Given a flow graph representing a loop nest, RAS allocates a set of resources, and schedules the nodes of the graph to the resources. RAS also generates an estimate of the amount of time it would take if the design implemented according to the schedule.This dissertation also presents results of designs produced by RAS. Multiple tests were performed using three computationally intense algorithms. RAS mapped the algorithms to five configurations representingdifferent sets of resource constraints. Two of the configurations were based on actual systems used in the research development, while the remainingthree were hypothetical systems based on other components available in the market. Experimental results from RASindicate that a significant amount of speedup is attainable using the allocated resources with the given schedule.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-06-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010619-175307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Referral-Based Recommender System for E-commerce</field><field name="creator">Mo, Wentao</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;WENTAO MO. A Referral-Based Recommender System for E-Commerce (Under the direction of Dr. Munindar P. Singh).The thesis is intended to develop the technology and infrastructure to allow people to share knowledge with and learn from each other. A special kind of multiagent system, called multiagent referral system (MARS), is proposed. In MARS, each user is assigned a software agent, and software agents help automate the process of expertise location by a series of ?referral chains.? Unlike most previous approaches, our architecture is totally distributed and preserves the privacy and autonomy of their users. These agents learn models of each other in terms of expertise (ability to produce correct domain answers), and sociability (ability to produce accurate referrals). &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010621-231234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">TWO NEW KA-BAND TRAVELING WAVE POWER DIVIDER/COMBINER DESIGNS</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;JIANG, XIN. Two new Ka-band traveling wave power divider/combiner designs. (Under the direction of Dr. Amir Mortazawi).The purpose of this thesis is to develop a traveling wave power dividing/combining technique for a Ka-band 32-device high power amplifier system. Based on this technique, two main components of the power amplifier system have been designed. One component is a back-to-back connected 4-way waveguide-to-waveguide power divider/combiner and the other one is a back-to-back connected 8-way waveguide-to-microstrip power divider/combiner. Of the two components, the former has exhibited a 4 GHz (~12.5%) 0.5 dB bandwidth with 0.15 dB insertion loss at 32 GHz in simulation. The later utilizes a novel power coupling structure, which has the advantages of low profile, ease of fabrication and efficient heat sinking for the solid-state amplifiers. It was fabricated and experiments on this passive structure have demonstrated a minimum overall insertion loss of 1.8 dB at 32.5 GHz with a 3 dB bandwidth of 15%. The power amplifier composed of these two traveling-wave designs offers a potential broadband solution for solid-state amplifiers applied in high power millimeter-wave systems.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-06-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010621-232340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">INTRUSION TOLERANT SYSTEMS CHARACTERIZATION AND ACCEPTANCE MONITOR DESIGN</field><field name="creator">Wang, Rong</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; Intrusion detection research has been so far mostly concentrated on techniques that effectively identify the malicious behaviors. No assurance can be assumed once a system is compromised. Intrusion tolerance, on the other hand, focuses on providing the desired services even when some components have been compromised. A DARPA-funded research project named SITAR (A Scalable Intrusion-Tolerant Architecture for Distributed Services) investigates the intrusion tolerance further in distributed systems to provide reliable services. Two specific challenges are addressed in this project: the first is how to take advantage of fault tolerant techniques in intrusion tolerant systems; the second is how to deal with possible attacks and compromised components so as to continue providing the service. This thesis represents part of the on-going development of the SITAR project. First, a state transition model is developed to describe the dynamic behavior of an intrusion tolerant system. Second, the Acceptance Monitor is designed to detect the system compromises from the request-response stream. Third, various kinds of vulnerabilities on Web-based COTS services are investigated and one specific design of the Acceptance Monitor is proposed and implemented for a Web-based COTS service to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We hope by utilizing the fault tolerance methodologies on the intrusion tolerance system we can solve the problem of providing reliable distributed services that are invulnerable to both known and unknown intrusions. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-06-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010625-213410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANALYSIS OF ADHESIVE BONDED FIBER-REINFORCED COMPOSITE JOINTS</field><field name="creator">Ficarra, Christina Helene</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The work presented in this thesis involved the analysis of adhesive bonded joints for composite bridge decks and was divided into three phases. The first phase involved a parametric study on a single lap joint using ANSYS finite element analysis software. The purpose of the parametric study was to alter the geometry and material properties of the joint and study their effects on the stress distribution in both the adherends and adhesive. The four different cases studied included adding a taper to the adherends, different edge shapes on the adhesive layer, a material stiffness imbalance and a geometric stiffness imbalance. It was found that for the taper case and the edge shape case, the stress field in the joint was affected slightly. The material and geometric stiffness imbalance cases had the most drastic affect on the stress field of both the adhesive and adherend. Phase two of this study involved physical tests on single lap joints pulled in uniaxial tension. Tests were performed on three different types of laminates in order to study the interfacial effects these laminates had on the adhesive bond. It was found that by changing the surface of the composite, the mode of failure changed significantly.Phase three of this research involved a study on surface preparation. Three different surface preparations were conducted on the adherends of a butt-strap joint. The first included an acetone wipe. The second involved sanding the adherends. The third surface preparation involved adding APRIME-2, a secondary bonding agent, to the adherends before adding the strap. By simply sanding the adherends, the load to failure was increased by 350% compared to an acetone wipe. The ATPRIME-2 improved the load to failure by an additional 60% as well as improved the failure mode to a fiber tear. It was concluded that surface preparation has a major impact on the behavior of adhesively bonded joints.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010626-155040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capacity Aspects of Bit Interleaved Coded Modulation</field><field name="creator">Jacob, Nishant</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Space-time block codes are a recently discovered, attractive modulation scheme for multiple antenna wireless channels. They are capable of providing full diversity over fading channels, at the same time requiring only low computational costs. Over the last few years, several distinct approaches to designing space-time codes have been proposed in the literature, including the layeredarchitecture, trellis codes, turbo codes and the orthogonal designs. Most work on space-time coding has focused on the problem of designing codes to perform well under quasi-static fading conditions. In practice, it is not unusual for a cellular handset to experience conditions which range from fast fading to nearly static within seconds (e.g., a vehicle suddenly braking). It is therefore of interest to design codes that are robust in the sense, that they perform well under a wide variety of channel fading conditions. A robust coding architecture called Bit-Interleaved Space-Time Coded Modulation is proposed for channels with multiple transmit and receive antennas. It is designed to perform well under a wide variety of channel fading conditions and which (when differentially encoded) does not require accurate channel estimates at the receiver. The architecture combines serial concatenation of short, full-diversity space-time block codes (inner code) with bit-interleaved coded modulation.This thesis examines the capacity aspects of this architecture namely, the ergodic capacity, the outage capacity and the ergodic and outage cut-off rates in Rayleigh flat-fading channels. It is shown that, if the inner block codes are chosen properly, not only is the capacity close to the information-theoretic limits, but also a better tradeoff between performance and coding complexity can be obtained.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010627-231158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Algorithms for Solving Disjoint PathProblem with Proportional Path-Costs</field><field name="creator">&#214;z&#231;am, Burcu</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to develop solution algorithms for the edge-disjoint path problem with proportional path-costs in an undirected network with single source-destination pair.

We proposed two genetic algorithms which differ in solution representation.The performance of both algorithms tested on small, medium and large size complete graphs using different cost structures. As a result, genetic algorithm with priority-based encoding is shown to beinefficient, whereas genetic algorithm with variable-length path encoding is shown to be satisfactoryfor finding the edge-disjoint paths with proportional path-costs.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010629-132423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH RESOLUTION DEPTH PROFILING OF ULTRA SHALLOW DOPANT IMPLANTS WITH SIMS</field><field name="creator">Loesing, Rainer</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;LOESING, RAINER, Development of High Resolution Depth Profiling Of Ultra Shallow Dopant Implants with SIMS (under the direction of Phillip E. Russell. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) is considered a reliable technique for precise and accurate dopant depth profiling in Si with respect to junction depth and implanted dose. The junction depths of source drain extension structures are predicted to be between 19-33nm for the 0.1&#181;m MOSFET generation. Accurate high depth resolution analysis of these ultra-shallow junctions by SIMS can only be provided if atomic mixing caused by energetic primary ion bombardment is minimized and extensive beam induced crater bottom roughening is avoided. For quantitative measurements, the influence of primary ion implantation, sputter rate changes and beam induced crater bottom roughness on secondary ion intensities has to be known. In this work SIMS was used to develop techniques for the accurate analysis of ultra shallow B, P and As implants in Si.Low energy O2+ primary ion bombardment was found to give the highest depth resolution for the analysis of B and P in Si, while low energy Cs+ and CsC6- primary ion bombardment resulted in the highest depth resolution for the analysis of As in Si. To obtain a more accurate profile shape and depth scale it was found to be essential to limit beam induced crater bottom roughness by means of sample rotation, variations of primary ion angle of incidence or change in sample chamber vacuum conditions. Beam induced crater bottom roughness was investigated for low energy O2+, Cs+ and CsC6- ion bombardment using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical profilometer (OP) measurements. OP was found to be a valuable tool for investigating small changes in sputter rate in the initial stages of a SIMS depth profile. It was shown that dose measurements of ultra shallow implants can be improved by using a correction procedure based on bulk doped standards. SIMS was proven to be a valuable tool for the characterization of ultra shallow implants in Si, but careful consideration of analysis conditions and SIMS artifacts is required for accurate analysis.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010630-163154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Patterns of air flow and particle deposition in the diseased human lung</field><field name="creator">Segal, Rebecca Anne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SEGAL, REBECCA ANNE. Patterns of air flow and particle depositionin the diseased human lung. (Under the direction of Michael Shearer.)In this work, we investigate particle deposition and air flow in thehuman lung. In particular we are interested in how the motion ofparticulate matter and air is affected by the presence of lungdisease. Patients with compromised lung function are more sensitiveto air pollution; understanding the extent of that sensitivity canlead to more effective air quality standards. Also, understanding ofair flow andparticle trajectories could lead to the development of better aerosoldrugs to treat the lung diseases.We focus our efforts on twodiseases: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchialtumors. Because COPD affects the majority of airways in a patientwith the disease, we are able to take a more global approach toanalyzing the effects of the disease. Using a FORTRAN codewhich computes total deposition in the lung over the course of onebreath, we modified the pre-existing code to account forthe difference between healthy subjects and patients with COPD. Usingthe model, itwas possible to isolate the different disease components of COPD andsimulate their effects separately. It was determined thatthe chronic bronchitis component of COPD was responsible for the increaseddeposition seen in COPD patients.While COPD affects the whole lung, tumors tend to belocalized to one or several airways. This led us to investigate theeffects of bronchial tumors in detail within these individualairways. Using a computational fluid dynamics package, FIDAP, wedefined a Weibel type branching network of airways.In particular, we modeled theairways of a four-year-old child.In the work with the tumors, we ran numerous simulations with variousinitial velocities and tumor locations. It was determined that tumorslocated on the carinal ridge had the dominant effect on the flow. Athigher initial velocities, areas of circulation developed downstreamfrom the tumors. Extensive simulations were run with a 2-D model. Theresults from the 2-D model were then compared with some initial 3-Dsimulations.In the development of the FIDAP model, we avoided thecomplications of flow past the larynx, by limiting the model togenerations 2-5 of the Weibel lung. We developed a realistic inletvelocity profile to be used as the input into the model. The skewednature ofthis inlet profile led to thequestion of boundary layer development and the determination of theentrance length needed to achieve fully developed parabolicflow. Simple scale analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations did notcapture the results we were seeing with the CFD simulations.We turned to a more quantitative, energy correctionanalysis to determine the theoretical entrance length.In conclusion, the presence of disease in the lunghas a large effect both on global deposition patterns and on localizedairflow patterns. This indicates the need for different protocolsregarding susceptibility of people to airborne pollutants that take intoaccount lung disease. It also suggests that treatment should accountfor changes in airflow in the diseased lung.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010702-165013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Commitment-Based Interoperation for E-Commerce</field><field name="creator">Xing, Jie</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Successful e-commerce presupposes techniques by which autonomous trading entities can interoperate. Although much progress has been made on data exchange and payment protocols, interoperation in the face of autonomy is still inadequately understood. Current techniques, designed for closed environments, support only the simplest interactions.This dissertation concentrates on two themes. First, we develop a generic agent interaction model that supports agent coordination. We propose metacommitment patterns, which accommodate revisions and exceptions, to model agent interaction. We formalize metacommitment patterns declaratively in temporal logic. We apply statecharts to specify behavior models of agents who follow our commitment patterns. The statecharts provide an operational semantics, which can be used as a rigorous basis for agent coordination. We propose agent behavior models and prove that it operationally supports our temporal logic semantics. In this manner, we provide the basis for formally designing coordinated multiagent systems. Second, we apply agent behavior models for interoperation in e-commerce. This approach consists of (1) behavioral models to specify autonomous, heterogeneous agents representing different trading entities (businesses, consumers, brokers), (2) a metamodel that provides a language (based on XML) for specifying a variety of service agreements and accommodating exceptions and revisions, and (3) an execution architecture that supports persistent and dynamic (re)execution. Our implementation uses existing Java tool kits for parsing XML and building communicating agents. The main contributions of this dissertation are in developing some theoretical aspects of agent interaction with an emphasis on e-commerce.In addition, the proposed approach can also provide a rigorous basis for future standards for interoperation in e-commerce.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010702-214503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sport Fan Team Identification in a Professional Expansion Setting</field><field name="creator">Greenwood, Paul Brian</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;GREENWOOD, PAUL BRIAN. Sport Fan Team Identification in a Professional Expansion Setting. (Under the direction of Michael A. Kanters.) This study assessed the relationship between team identification of sport fans and a number of different variables including but not limited to: the reasons for initially becoming a fan, specific sport knowledge, and purchasing behavior. A non-random sample of spectators (N = 356) at an Arena Football League (AFL) game completed a survey designed to identify or measure the aforementioned variables. A t-test revealed that males reported significantly higher levels of team identification than females. Analysis using a Pearson correlation matrix showed a positive correlation between team identification and sport knowledge, attendance rate, and purchasing behavior. Likewise, a positive correlation was found between team identification and the following reasons for initially becoming a fan: closest team, born and/or live in the city and/or state, team success, the players and/or coaches, parents and/or family influence, and the tailgating and party atmosphere. The findings have important implications for professional sport franchises in terms of tailoring marketing efforts for potential fans.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010703-110532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiscale Signal Processing and Shape Analysis for an Inverse SAR Imaging System</field><field name="creator">HE, YUN</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The great challenge in signal processing is to devise computationally efficient and statistically optimal algorithms for estimating signals from noisy background and understanding their contents. This thesis treats the problem of multiscale signal processing and shape analysis for an Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging system. To address some of the limitations of conventional techniques in radar image processing, an information theoretic approach for target motion estimation is first proposed. A wavelet based multiscale method for shape enhancement is subsequently derived and followed by a regression technique for shape recognition.Building on entropy-based divergence measures which have shown promising results in many areas of engineering and image processing, we introduce in this thesis a new generalized divergence measure, namely the Jensen-R&#233;nyi divergence. Upon establishing its properties such as convexity and its upper bound etc., we apply it to image registration for ISAR focusing as well as related problems in data fusion. Attempting to extend current approaches to signal estimation in a wavelet framework, which have generally relied on the assumption of normally distributed perturbations, we propose a novel non-linear filtering technique, as a pre-processing step for the shapes obtained from an ISAR imaging system. The key idea is to project a noisy shape onto a wavelet domain and to suppress wavelet coefficients by a mask derived from curvature extrema in its scale space representation. For a piecewise smooth signal, it can be shown that filtering by this curvature mask is equivalent to preserving the signal pointwise H&#246;lder exponents at the singular points, and to lifting its smoothness at all the remaining points. To identify a shape independently of its registration information, we propose matching two configurations by regression, using notations of general shape spaces and procrustean distances. In particular, we study the generalized matching by estimating mean shapes in two dimensions. Simulation results show that matching by way of a mean shape is more robust than matching target shapes directly.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010704-160913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creation of Casual Index Based on Habit Stocks and General Social Behaviors</field><field name="creator">Lee, Eun-Kyung</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;LEE, EUN-KYUNG. Creation of Casual Index Based on Habit Stocks and General Social Behaviors. (Under the direction of Dr. Moon W. Suh and Dr. William Oxenham.)A fashion preference indicator called "Casual Index" was created to signify and measure the degree of casualness at any given time point by using various statistical and econometrics models. The indices were created based on two approaches; one for theoretically constructed and the other for practical application. The theory-based Casual Index is a composite index formulated from two sub-indices that were derived from the general social behaviors and apparel demand patterns of contemporary Americans. The consumption-based Casual Index is also a composite index aimed at practical application, derived from consumption data on certain apparel items. In addition, the Total Casual Index was created by combining the consumption-based Casual Indices of men and women based on unit volumes of apparel consumption. In deriving the various casual indices, the General Social Survey data from National Opinion Research Center (University of Chicago) and the Current Industrial Report MQ23A of U.S. Bureau of Census from 1972 through 1998 were applied. For the first time, the behavioral patterns of the society and the habit formation by consumers were combined in creating and successfully validating theoretically formulated Casual Index. The statistical methods applied were proven to be highly effective. The consumption-based Casual Index was shown to be most useful for practical applications as well as for forecasting for the future casual trends. Although somewhat subjective in the formulation, the newly created Total Casual Index is expected to enhance its utility in the absence of complex data and mathematical models. The casual indices derived for both men and women suggest that the casual trends have shifted dynamically during the last three decades. Based on the Total Casual Index, the 1998 figure (75.7) is shown to be higher than that of 1972 (63.7). &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Technology Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010705-124113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anomaly Detection for Wireless Ad-Hoc Routing Protocols</field><field name="creator">Huang, Yi-an</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;HUANG, YI-AN.

The temperature and stability of the Ga source were critical in terms of uniform nucleation and growth. The source temperature was maintained at 1260C to minimize a rapid reaction leading to the formation of GaN and the subsequent decomposition beneath the surface and consequent spattering of Ga. A maximum crystal growth temperature of 1130C was determined in which the GaN growth kinetics were much greater than decomposition. The number of nucleation events was reduced and the crystal size increased by a novel nucleation technique wherein ammonia was introduced at high temperatures. The resulting crystals were either needles or platelets depending on the process variables employed. Low V/III ratios achieved via ammonia flow rates 75sccm and/or ammonia total pressures 430Torr favored lateral growth. The average lateral growth rate for the platelets was ~50micron/hr; the average vertical growth rate for the needles was ~500micron/hr. Growth rates in all other directions for each of these two morphologies were very low. Seeded growth of both needle and platelet crystals was also achieved; however, the growth rate decreased at longer times and higher pressures due to reaction with hydrogen from the increased decomposition of ammonia. Nitrogen dilution of ammonia reduced the amount of hydrogen generated as a result of ammonia decomposition and increased the kinetic barrier to desorption of reactants from the GaN surface and then alleviated the enhanced decomposition of GaN crystals. A 2mm x 1.5mm needle and a 2.3mm x 1.8mm x 0.3mm platelet of GaN were grown with minimal decomposition in a 66.7% ammonia + 33.3% nitrogen gas mixture. Excellent crystalline quality was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and Photoluminescence.Crystal growth using a Ga- 5at%Al source was conducted in an attempt to increase growth rate and inhibit decomposition. No notable change in growth rate was observed and hollow crystals were formed, indicating that Al promotes vertical growth under otherwise similar conditions for GaN growth. In addition, fine-grained AlN was formed within the binary Ga-Al source, thus, the supply of Al was progressively reduced. Nucleation control via addition of Si resulted in a slightly reduced number of larger crystals. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy suggested that amorphous silicon nitride was formed on the BN substrate and nucleation rate was slightly reduced. Silicon was not detected within the sensitivity of Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy revealed insignificant amount of Si present in the crystal. Smoother surface morphology of the crystals grown in the presence of Si was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010706-210436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the Structural and Electronic Properties of Self-Assembled Monolayers ?

The study of materials that have utility at the level of several, or single, molecules is exciting becausethe development of these sorts of systems offers a pathway to potentially avoid the perils of continually shrinking Silicon-based fabrication. This work examines the state of the art in fabrication techniques for semiconductor systems, then examines current examples of ME to be found in the academic literature. This review is designed to plumb the depths of a few important demonstrations, as opposed to a broad overview of the entire body of work. Further, scanning probe lithography techniques are demonstrated that allow for the study of small ensembles of interesting molecules in isolation. By utilizing these techniques, the structural and electronic properties of molecules can be studied, with a focus towards determining the likely utility of a particular species in a ME framework. Experimental study of redox-active self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films shows that under specific conditions, some films display a negative differential resistance (NDR) response that has possible utility in the development of ME devices. Ferrocene- and galvinol-terminated SAMs both show NDR at room temperature.

Beichner)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of curricula development is not only understanding what difficulties students have but also, why they have these difficulties. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility that students have difficulty with the concept of electric potential because they have difficulty with the concept of rate of change. The study sample consisted of over 300 students from various colleges and universities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate this relationship, I created a diagnostic instrument that contains 14 items on rate of change and 11 items on electric potential this is the Rate And Potential Test (RAPT). These items were taken from other diagnostic instruments or modified from questions used in other research studies. I also conducted think-aloud interviews to insure that students were interpreting the items correctly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My findings can be broken into two areas. The first area deals with findings about the relationship between student difficulties with rate of change and electric potential. The second area of findings deals with the appropriateness of the RAPT for investigating this relationship. I found that there is a correlation between the way students answer rate of change items and the way they answer electric potential items. I also found that some students in upper-level undergraduate courses made mistakes similar to introductory students. The RAPT was found to be a reliable (KR20 = 0.83) instrument and it did not matter if it was given on paper or via WebAssign, a web-based homework delivery system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010709-220225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Conservative Interblock Communication Algorithm forDynamically Discontinuous Block Boundary Grids</field><field name="creator">Bond, Ryan Bomar</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;BOND, RYAN BOMAR. A Conservative Interblock Communication Algorithmfor Dynamically Discontinuous Multiblock Interface Grids.(Under the direction of Dr. D. Scott McRae.)&lt;p&gt; An algorithm is presented for the conservative communication between gridblocks where point connectivity is not maintained across across theinterface. The algorithm is specifically designed for dynamicdiscontinuities, e.g. those that arise when dynamic r-refinementadaptation is performed on two adjacent blocks without the constraint ofboundary point connectivity. r-Refinement adaptation involves moving thepoints in the computational mesh to better resolve features in thesolution field. Discontinuously connected multiblock boundaries arenecessary for problems where adjacent blocks have significantly differentadaptation requirements or problems where one block is to be adapted whilean adjacent block is left stationary. In programs where adaptation isbeing performed in parallel, discontinuously connected multiblockboundaries allow the adaptation to continue on different processorswithout the need for communication and subsequent agreement of where theboundary points should be located.&lt;p&gt;The communication between two adjacent blocks must be conservative toallow the simulation of compressible flow problems. Simply interpolatingthe boundary data to transfer information from one block to the otherviolates conservation, so other means of transferring the information mustbe employed. A technique for generating ghost cells and setting theirdependent variable values is presented. The method is conservative,accurate, robust, and computationally efficient.&lt;p&gt;Tests of the algorithm on both statically and dynamically discontinuousgrids are presented, and the computational efficiency of the algorithm isdiscussed. The algorithm was tested using the diffusion equation, linearwave equation, and the set of Euler equations. Since the algorithm isapplicable to any CFD problem where conservative communication isnecessary between discontinuous blocks, it can be used when adaptationcriteria are different between adjacent blocks, when an adapted block isadjacent to an unadapted block, or when enhanced parallelism can beachieved by relaxing boundary point connectivity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010710-110646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, Optical and Electronic Investigations of Organically Bridged Metal Nanoparticle Arrays</field><field name="creator">Novak, James Paul</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTNovak, James Paul Synthesis, Optical and Electronic Investigations of Organically Bridged Metal Nanoparticle Arrays (North Carolina State University, Under the direction of Dan L. Feldheim) The study of metal nanoparticles has been a growing field over the past 10 years. Many investigations have been performed that investigate the optical and electronic properties of these nanoparticles. Studies have been published that show the properties of individual nanoparticles and also large aggregates of nanoparticles. An area that has been largely ignored is the effect of symmetry and interparticle distance on electronic and optical coupling. This has largely been due to the lack of synthetic methods that allow precise control over the number of particles in an array, the symmetry that these particles obtain, and the interparticle distance in these arrays. This dissertation will discuss methods for synthesizing organic bridges that template the interparticle geometry to molecular dimensions. The discussion continues with characterization of these nanoparticle arrays. The role of symmetry and interparticle distance will be in the forefront as these nanoparticle arrays are investigated for linear electromagnetic coupling and non-linear optical response. Spectroscopy will be shown that directly addresses the position of this linking bridge. In addition, electrochemical behavior is shown as a function of interparticle coupling.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010710-141144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network Management And Intrusion Detection For Quality of Network Services</field><field name="creator">Fu, Zhi</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The explosive growth in worldwide communication via the Internet has increased the reliance oforganizations and individuals on the electronically transmitted information, which consequentlycreated rising demands to protect data from information leakage, corruption or alteration duringtransmission. Various security service requirements are demanded among different applications andcustomers with consideration of respective data sensitivity level, performance requirement andmonetary investment. It becomes important to provide end-to-end security service commitment tosatisfy the diverse customers needs. We expect the Quality of Protection (QoP) to fulfill end-to-endsecurity service commitment to be integrated within the emerging QoS networks to support secure QoSInternet service. For clarity, we call both of QoP and QoS ?Quality of Network Services? (QoNS).The security issues surrounding the QoNS (QoP and QoS) provisioning have been studied in my PhDresearch. The thesis is composed of two main parts, i.e. QoP security and QoS security. First, thepolicy issues of QoP security service are analyzed and automatic policy generation algorithms arepresented. Furthermore, a signaling protocol is designed to provide end-to-end security service forQoP. The protocol is designed to be secure to protect messages against possible forgery andmodification attacks. Second, the threats to the QoS signaling protocol RSVP are analyzed andcountermeasures are proposed.

Included in these concerns were the overlap of the field oxide by the gate electrode, the angle of the active-area sidewall, and the increase in size of the active area due to an etch bias. In addition, the growth of a contaminant layer, or ad-layer,on oxides that do not have a permanent gate-electrode was addressed. This ad-layer forms immediately after a wafer is exposed to the lab ambient and causes a significant increase (i.e., ~ 10%) in the apparent thickness of the oxide.The refinement of the total capacitance to the active-area capacitance uses measured data from Hg-gated capacitors on p-type Si wafers and Al / Poly-Si gated capacitors on both p- and n-type Si wafers. The effects of a non-vertical sidewall and an etch bias are addressed theoretically through the use of the classic treatment of capacitance. The capacitance-voltage characteristics from the MOS capacitors were used to extract the oxide thickness (tox).The extracted thickness was determined from a model-based methodology (i.e., the slope method) and a model-based analysis (i.e., NCSU's CVC model). It is shown that the effect of a non-vertical sidewall and an etch bias are negligible. The effect of the gate electrode overlap, while small, should be removed. It is also shown that a model-based analysis of the active-area capacitance characteristics results in a consistent oxide thickness over the range of capacitor areas that were available.The removal and re-growth of the ad-layer were investigated using current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characteristics from blanket oxides on both p- and n-type silicon wafers. The changes in these characteristics were quantified as the ad-layer grows over time. The C-V characteristics were analyzed using NCSU's CVC program in order to extract values for oxide thickness, flatband voltage, and interface trap densities. The ad-layer causes considerable inaccuracies in the model extraction of oxide thickness as well as the flatband voltage and interface trap density. Electrical and optical results on the p-type wafer both show that the ad-layer increases the apparent oxide thickness by ~ 0.25 nm and the electrical results show that the ad-layer shifts the flatband voltage by as much as 100 mV.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010710-152356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterization of a gene that is associated with Listeria monocytogenes serotype 4b-specific surface antigen expression</field><field name="creator">Li, Jianying</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Listeria monocytogenes is the cause of human listeriosis, a food borne disease with high mortality. Serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b account for most cause of illness. Serotype 4b is of special interest, for its high implication in foodborne outbreaks. Two loci were previously found to be involved in serotype-specific surface antigen expression of L. monocytogenes serotype 4b. One mutant, 27B6, derived from L.monocytogenes serotype 4b strain 2381L (Jalisco cheese outbreak), was found to be negative in immunoblot reactions with all three serotype 4b-specific MAbs C74.22, C74.33, and C74.180. Chromatographic analysis showed markedly reduced levels of two sugar substituents on the teichoic acid backbone, compared with the wild type strain. The mutant was furthermore resistant to Listeria species-specific phage A511, while still sensitive to serotype 4b-specific phage 2671. In this study, the transposon localized in a new genomic region (locus III). The genes in this region had homologues in the database involved in galactose metabolism, including galM, galE, and pgm. The transposon in 27B6 was found to be in the putative pgm. Interestingly, although inactivation of the putative pgm affected the presentation of both serotype-specific sugar substituents on the teichoic acid, the gene was not found to be unique to serotype 4b. The gene pgm was present in L.monocytogenes serotypes other than 4b, while it was absent or highly divergent in other species. An in-frame deletion of pgm was constructed, showing similar phenotypes as those of the initial transposon mutant 27B6. The wild type pgm sequence could successfully complement mutant 27B6 in-trans, restoring wild-type reactivity with MAbs, as well as phage A511 sensitivity. In conclusion, this newly characterized genomic region of L.monocytogenes may function in sugar metabolism and is possibly associated with cell wall teichoic acid glycosylation in serotype 4b, being required for expression of serotype 4b-specific antigenic determinants as well as receptors for phage A511. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Food Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010711-100349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Feature-Based Approach to Automating High-Level Process Planning</field><field name="creator">Febransyah, Ade</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;High-level process planning plays an important role in determining candidate process domains at the configuration design stage. Changing the processes domainslater increases the product development cycle and the product development cost. Therefore, determining the most appropriate manufacturing processes at thebeginning stages of the design process becomes critical. However, high-level process planning systems have traditionally lacked integration of design synthesis anddesign evaluation. The main objective of this research has been to develop a FEature-Based Design And Process Planning (FEBDAPP) system that helps designers decide whether ornot the design is worth pursuing by providing manufacturing advice to designers during the design process. In order to achieve the main objective, the following taskshave been accomplished: (1) developed a hybrid system incorporating design by feature and feature recognition approaches capable of reducing the complexity offeature recognition algorithms without sacrificing flexibility in creating a part design, (2) developed a comprehensive set of feature mapping algorithms capable oftransforming a primary part representation into a secondary part representation that is required as input to downstream applications, and (3) developed aCAD-based interface capable of integrating a current CAD system with a high-level process planning system.This research contributes significantly to the availability of early design tools that enhance and at the same time shorten the design process cycle. The implementationof feature technology in this research will support the development of applications such as tooling cost estimation and manufacturability analysis. Finally, theFEBDAPP system is intended to be an effective concurrent engineering tool that bridges the gap between design and manufacturing.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010711-140320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EFFECTS OF ACTIVATED CARBON SURFACE CHEMISTRY AND PORE STRUCTURE ON THE ADSORPTION OF METHYL TERTIARY-BUTYL ETHER AND TRICHLOROETHENE FROM NATURAL WATER</field><field name="creator">Quinlivan, Patricia Ann</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Activated carbon adsorption is the best available treatment technology for thecontrol of many objectionable trace organic compounds. Activated carbons are frequentlycharacterized by the iodine number and BET surface area, but these parameters do notcorrelate well with trace organic compound removal from natural water. Therefore, theobjective of this research was to develop activated carbon selection criteria that assure theeffective removal of trace organic contaminants from natural water and to base theselection criteria on the adsorbent?s pore structure and surface chemistry. Tosystematically evaluate pore structure and surface chemistry effects, a matrix of activatedcarbon fibers (ACFs) with three activation levels and four surface chemistry levels wasstudied. To evaluate whether adsorption trends established for ACFs were also valid forgranular activated carbon (GAC), ACF results were compared with those obtained forthree commercially available GACs. Adsorption capacities were determined for naturalorganic matter (NOM), for relatively hydrophilic methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) andrelatively hydrophobic trichloroethene (TCE) in organic-free water, and for MTBE andTCE in the presence of NOM. NOM isotherms showed that DOC adsorption occurredprimarily in pores with diameters in the 11 to 500 &#197; range and that electrostaticinteractions between NOM and the carbon surface played a role in NOM adsorption.According to both single-solute isotherms and micropollutant isotherms in the presence of NOM, hydrophobic adsorbents more effectively removed TCE and MTBE thanhydrophilic adsorbents. Effective adsorbents for drinking water treatment shouldtherefore contain little oxygen and nitrogen whose presence increases the polarity of theadsorbent surface. Based on the elemental composition of the low-ash carbons evaluatedin this study, activated carbons should have oxygen and nitrogen contents that sum to nomore than 2 to 3 mmol/g to assure sufficient hydrophobicity. In addition, both single-soluteisotherms and isotherms in the presence of NOM indicated that adsorbents shouldexhibit a large pore volume in micropores with widths that are about 1.5 times larger thanthe kinetic diameter of the target adsorbate. Furthermore, based on the micropollutantisotherms in the presence of NOM, an effective adsorbent should possess a microporesize distribution that extends to widths that are approximately twice the kinetic diameterof the target adsorbate to prevent pore blockage or restriction as a result of NOMadsorption.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010711-170529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF AN ASSETS-BASED YOUTH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE UNDERPRIVILEGED YOUTH WITH EDUCATIONAL AND EMPLOYMENT RESOURCES</field><field name="creator">Romano, Tara Lynn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; This study was an evaluation of a 4-H Youth DevelopmentProgram that provided a series of weekend camps and a weeklong summer camp to underprivileged youth.

This program took place in Carteret County, NC. The major purposes of this study were: (1) to determine whether or not the youths' knowledge, skills, and aspirations increased due to their participation in this program; and (2) to provide recommendations for the program so that the program may increase its effectiveness and possibly be replicated by other counties in North Carolina. A case study research design was used to gather data for this evaluation, with a variety of different data collected from program staff, local schools, parents and guardians of the program participants, and the participants themselves. Surveys, pre- and post-tests, interviews, and observations were the tools used to collect the data. A control group of inactive participants (who had rarely attended program activities) was used as a comparison for the group of youth that were active program participants. An analysis of the data determined if any trends or patterns existed that supported the program's objectives of increasing the youth's knowledge, skills, and aspirations. The major findings of this study were that: (1) the program, while providing some benefits to the children in terms of support and relationship-building, did not completely achieve its objectives; and (2) a number of recommendations, including increased family involvement in the program, could help to improve and possibly achieve the program's initial objectives. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Agricultural and Extension Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010711-202352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth via Low Pressure Metalorganic Vapor PhaseEpitaxy and Surface Characterization of GaN and In(x)Ga(1-x)N Thin Films.</field><field name="creator">Miraglia, Peter Quinn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research presented herein has been to determine the underlyingmechanisms of and to optimize the growth parameters for the growth of smooth surfaceson InGaN and GaN thin films via metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy.

The two chief parameters affecting template surface roughness in both growth ofGaN above 1000&#194;&#186;C were determined to be temperature and layer thickness. An optimumtemperature of 1020&#194;&#186;C was found for the former process, below which the islands formedin the growth on AlN buffer layers did not coalesce properly, and above which a hillockgrowth instability was pervasive on the surface. Increasing the GaN film depositiontemperature to 1100&#194;&#176;C for GaN film deposition via PE enhanced sidewall growth;however, surface roughness was increased on the (0001) growth plane through theformation of hillocks. Template thickness above 2.5 microns had the lowest root mean squaresurface roughness of 0.48nm over 100 square microns. This was attributed to reductions indislocation density, as measured by corresponding 50% reductions in symmetric andasymmetric full width half maximum values of X-ray rocking curves.

Integrated Watershed Management Using a Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach (Under the direction of Dr. Ranji S. Ranjithan)Watershed management requires consideration of a multitude of factors affecting water quality at the watershed-scale while integrating point and non-point sources of pollution and control. While the existing water quality modeling systems and associated quantitative tools can assist in some aspects of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development for a watershed, their abilities to assist in determining efficient management strategies are limited. Typically, the best a user can do is employ these tools manually to explore the solution space via a trial-and-error process, which is inefficient for finding management strategies that consider water quality as well as a multitude of other design issues simultaneously. Recent implementation of the STAR (STrategy, Analysis, and Reporting) system incorporates a set of systems analytic tools to assist decisions-makers explore and identify alternative management strategies. The main engine of the STAR system is a genetic algorithm-based optimization technique, which is coupled with additional tools such as an uncertainty propagation tool, a solution reporting system, and an incremental strategy development system to form a decision support framework. This paper describes some of the capabilities of this framework through several illustrative scenarios for the Yellow River watershed in Gwinnett County, Georgia, which conducted a comprehensive, countywide TMDL investigation to assess the current water quality conditions. The STAR system?s capabilities are employed to identify ways to achieve minimum total phosphorous (TP) levels via point and nonpoint source controls, as well as characterize the implications of future urban development on TP levels. Noninferior tradeoffs between urban development and TP levels at different degrees of point source controls are generated. The range of uses of the STAR system in considering the integrated effect of point and non-point sources in watershed management is demonstrated throughout these illustrative scenarios.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010713-114413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unsteady Measurements and Computations on an Oscillating Airfoil with Gurney Flaps</field><field name="creator">Price, Jennifer Lou</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Price, Jennifer Lou. Unsteady Measurements and Computations on an Oscillating Airfoil with Gurney Flaps. (Under the direction of Dr. Ndaona Chokani)The effect of a Gurney flap on an unsteady airfoil flow is experimentally and computationally examined. In the experiment, the details of the unsteady boundary layer events on the forward portion of the airfoil are measured. In the computation, the features of the global unsteady flow are documented and correlated with the experimental observations.The experiments were conducted in the North Carolina State University subsonic wind tunnel on an oscillating airfoil at pitch rates of 65.45 degrees/sec and 130.9 degrees/sec. The airfoil has a NACA0012 cross-section and is equipped with a 1.5% or 2.5% chord Gurney flap. The airfoil is tested at Reynolds numbers of 96,000, 169,000 and 192,000 for attached and light dynamic stall conditions. An array of surface-mounted hot-film sensors on the forward 25% chord of the airfoil is used to measure the unsteady laminar boundary layer separation, transition-to-turbulence, and turbulent reattachment. In parallel with the experiments incompressible Navier-Stokes computations are conducted for the light dynamic stall conditions on the airfoil with a 2.5%c Gurney flap at a Reynolds number of 169,000.The experimental measurements show that the effect of the Gurney flap is to move the separation, transition and reattachment forward on the airfoil. This effect is more marked during the airfoil's pitch-down than during pitch-up. The computational results verify these observations, and also show that the shedding of the dynamic stall vortex is delayed. Thus the adverse effects of dynamic stall are mitigated by the Gurney flap.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerospace Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010713-170959</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the Adoption of Agroforestry In Southeastern Mexico:Three Essays from a Survey with Farmers in Calakmul, Campeche</field><field name="creator">Casey, James F.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTCasey, James Francis. Examining the Adoption of Agroforestry in Southeastern Mexico: Three Essays from a Survey with Farmers in Calakmul, Campeche. (Under the direction of Robert C. Abt.)In three essays, farmer preferences are analyzed using Contingent Valuation and Choice Modeling. Particular attention is paid to the role of uncertainty, investment in human capital and the importance of forest conservation. The data analyzed in each of the three essays was collected by the author from July 1997 through March 1998. The first essay empirically tests the hypothesis that investment in human capital increases the likelihood of participation in an agroforestry development program. Results support the hypothesis that human capital investments that reduce uncertainty, improve the likelihood of participation in an agroforestry development program. In the second essay a choice modeling experiment (CM) is used to assess the value farmers have for different agroforestry systems and the individual attributes that make up each system. Results suggest that farmers in Calakmul place a value on 1) conserving and increasing local forest cover, 2) working in a nursery in order to obtain seedlings, and 3) receiving enough technical assistance to get started with a program. The third essay uses an application of the discrete-choice contingent valuation method to estimate the willingness of farmers, in southeastern Mexico, to participate in forest conservation efforts. The estimated values of the marginal effects from a probit model (Cameron 1987) are used to develop welfare estimates. Results suggest farmers are willing to work slightly less than three days per month in order to preserve an area of community forest. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010716-155253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Evaluation of TEAR, a TCP-friendly Flow Control Protocol, Over the Internet and Wireless Networks</field><field name="creator">Jayaram, Ranjith S.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;TCP Emulation at Receivers (TEAR) is a TCP-friendly protocol that has been proposed for real-time multimedia flow control. Most best-effort traffic on the Internet is well-served by TCP, the dominant transport protocol. However, many applications with real-time constraints, such as multimedia streaming find TCP's response to congestion quite severe and too drastic to deliver acceptable end-user quality. TEAR was designed in order to provide smoothly varying rate changes for such applications while being friendly to competing TCP flows. In this thesis, weevaluate and verify TEAR's performance over the Internet. We verify TEAR's fairness to TCP, the smoothness of its rate fluctuations and its stability in the presence of network perturbations. We then adapt TEAR to run over wireless networks and consider using round-trip delay instead of packet loss as a congestion indication for wireless networks. We present the results of our experiments with TEAR over commercially deployed wireless networks in South Korea. We recount our experiences with the loss-delay characteristics of these networks. We analyze how TEAR competes with TCP, which is known to suffer from severe degradations in environments where the underlying network is unreliable. We then study TEAR's rate variations and the increased longer-term predictability it provides over wireless networks.

With the discovery of fumonisin toxicity to animals and humans, and the finding that no maize genotypes are resistant to Fusarium verticillioides infection or fumonisin contamination, management strategies for limiting fungal and toxin contamination of harvested grain are necessary. Maize ears were harvested weekly for 14 or 15 weeks after pollination and assayed for percent kernel infection and fumonisin contamination. Kernel infection and fumonisin contamination occurred before kernel maturity and increased throughout the season, with kernel infection peaking 7 to 10 weeks after pollination. Data from this experiment and data from grower?s fields indicate that early harvest is necessary to limit rotten kernels and fumonisin in harvested grain.Difficulty in identifying resistant genotypes has limited the development of more resistant hybrids. Many inoculation techniques have been employed to reproduce Fusarium ear rot with marginal results, primarily because differentially resistant and susceptible hybrids were not used to identify promising inoculation techniques. In my study, ears were treated with different inoculation techniques to reproduce ear rot and fumonisin contamination in hybrids of known resistance to Fusarium ear rot. Two inoculation techniques, Pinbar and Silk Channel, were able to separate hybrids on visible ear rot and fumonisin contamination. Addition of inoculum to ears appears important for screening hybrids for resistance to Fusarium ear rot and fumonisin contamination.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant Pathology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010718-161312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Methodology for Study of Network Processing Architectures</field><field name="creator">Suryanarayanan, Deepak</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A new class of processors has recently emerged that encompasses programmable ASICs and microprocessors that can implement adaptive network services.

Site quality is a key element in the plan for management to reach its objectives. Accurately measuring site quality can determine the optimal locations for intensively managed plantations and the areas that may be better managed for other purposes. The identification of these areas will allow management to maximize the returns from the forest regardless of the objectives. There are a number of methods available for measuring site quality that includes both direct and indirect methods. The standard method among foresters in the United States is the direct method of the site index approach. The most common indirect method is the soil-site study. The objectives of this research are to examine these two procedures for their reliability and accuracy in determining the site quality on the Hofmann Forest.The foundation that the site index approach is built upon is the theory that tree height growth in relation to age is very sensitive to site quality but is independent of various factors; i.e. stocking density, species compositions, etc (Avery and Burkhart, 1994). Therefore if height growth is not independent of these factors then the site index approach will provide erroneous predictions. The current measure of site quality on the Hofmann Forest was provided by a soil-site study performed by T. S. Coile in 1966. A recent timber inventory of the forest provides a means of testing the accuracy of these measures. An intensive database was constructed from the timber inventory collected by F &amp; W Services, Inc., the soil mapping performed by T. S. Coile, and previous climatic and environmental data for the forest. To achieve the objectives of this research the data was used to develop a non-linear model containing three categories or groups of variables. These categories include variables representing management decisions, soil characteristics, and environmental factors. The model produced an R-squared value of 0.62 with a p-value of &lt;0.0001. A correlation analysis of the height predictions and the actual heights collected in the timber inventory produced a correlation coefficient of 0.79. Nested structural tests found management decisions very significant in influencing height growth. Soil characteristics and precipitation were not significant individually but were when used in conjunction with each other. A correlation analysis was performed on the model predictions and the previous predictions found in Coile's soil-site study, which produced a correlation coefficient of 0.06. Also, the correlation of Coile's predictions and the actual tree heights was 0.22. A forest wide average height at a base age of 25 years was predicted at 10.94 feet lower than that found by Coile. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010721-150230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CAD based Computer Vision for Pose Determination of Wooden Parts</field><field name="creator">Kulkarni, Parikshit S.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Furniture manufacturers today have to deal with the conflicting objectives of increased product variety with reduced lead-time and inventory levels. The prevalentsentiment in the industry is a build to order production strategy, which tends to increase the production costs. Furniture makers are hence looking for technologicalsolutions to counter these issues. Fixture-less machining on CNC routers is an alternative gaining prominence among manufacturers to reduce setup times andincrease productivity. However, in the absence of locating pins for mounting the parts, the orientation and part placement becomes critical and small errors canincrease rejection rates. Updating the CNC part programs after determining the exact orientation and location of the part blanks is a likely solution. This thesisrepresents an effort to develop a computer vision based system to enable this. Some of the popular techniques in computer vision for object recognition were henceimplemented. These however did not prove worthwhile as the efficacy of the algorithms was undermined by the texture from wood grains. A template matchingprocedure was identified as being better suited for the purpose because of its inherent tolerance for noise. The generation of the template to account for hidden linesand actual projected lengths, both functions of the viewing direction and camera location, was however the biggest challenge. The fact that most furnituremanufacturers have a very large product range that needs machining on the router compounds the problem. A novel CAD based template generation algorithm washence proposed and implemented. The developed algorithms enabled orientation determination with a negligible error, and the average error in locating the part wasless than 0.2 percent. The approach was therefore found to have a potential in reducing the lead times while specifying tighter tolerances to reduce raw-materialconsumption. Finally, some future work to completely automate the process and to extend the applicability of the approach has been proposed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010721-205814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing Galois Groups for Certain Classes of Ordinary Differential Equations</field><field name="creator">Berman, Peter Hillel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;As of now, it is an open problem to find an algorithmthat computes the Galois group G of an arbitrary linear ordinary differential operator L in C(x)[D].

Genetic Architecture of Hybrid Fitness andWood Quality Traits in a Wide Interspecific Cross of Tree Species. (Under thesupervision of Ross W. Whetten and Ronald R. Sederoff.)The genetic architecture of interspecific differentiation plays a key role in the evolution ofreproductive isolating barriers in plants, and has important implications for hybrid breedingprograms. Interspecific hybridization is an important approach towards the genetic improvementof tree plantations. However, incompatibilities between diverged eucalypt genomesoften lead to reduced fitness of interspecific hybrids and decrease the efficiency of hybridbreeding programs. Furthermore, very little information is available on the genetic control ofquantitative traits in interspecific hybrids of tree species.The aim of this project was to obtain a detailed description of the genetic architecture ofhybrid fitness and wood property traits in an interspecific cross between two commerciallyimportant hardwood tree species, . This cross combinesthe superior growth and adaptability of E.globulus&lt;/I&gt;. The two species are members of different sections of the subgenus Symphyomyrtus andhybrid generations of this wide cross are characterized by large amounts of F hybrid inviabilityand F hybrid breakdown.Two interspecific backcross families of were each genotyped withmore than 800 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers using a new high-throughputprotocol for AFLP analysis on automated DNA sequencers. A pseudo-backcrossmapping approach was used to generate detailed comparative genetic maps of a single superior Fhybrid tree and of two backcross parents. The genetic maps of the two pure species parents andthe F hybrid were colinear and 11 comparative synteny groups were characterized. Overallrecombination rates did not differ significantly, although heterogeneity in recombination rateswas observed in several map regions.Approximately 30% of the AFLP markers were significantly distorted from expectedsegregation ratios. The distorted markers were located in specific map regions and distortion washighly directional in these regions. A Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach was used toestimate the position and effect of genetic factors that cause segregation distortion. At least sixsegregation distorting loci (SDL) were located in the genetic maps of the F hybrid. Two SDLwere detected in the genome of the E.globulus&lt;/I&gt; backcross parent. Donor alleles were found to be favored in the recurrent geneticbackground at several SDL in the maps of the F hybrid. Marker-assisted breeding based ondetailed, whole-genome genotypes of hybrids may be useful to minimize the effect of hybridbreakdown factors in further generations of this cross.Near-infrared (NIR) analysis was used to predict wood property trait values for approximately270 individuals of each backcross family after two years of growth in a field site. The trait dataand AFLP genotypes were used for QTL detection and analysis in the parental genetic maps. Inaddition, a principal component analysis was performed on the NIR spectral data of eachbackcross family and the data used to map QTLs for NIR spectral variation. A total of 18 QTLsfor NIR predicted wood properties and NIR spectral variation were characterized in the parentalmaps of the BC family.Many of the QTLs had effects on multiple, correlated wood property traits and on raw NIRspectral variation. Individual principal components of NIR spectral variation were correlated withgroups of chemical and physical wood properties, and shared several large-effect QTLs with theindividual wood properties. These QTL may represent key genetic loci that are involved in thegenetic differentiation of wood properties between these two species.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010723-175234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SCHEDULING AND ROUTING FOR DEMAND RESPONSIVE TRANSIT OPERATIONS</field><field name="creator">Srinivasan, Aravind</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Aravind Srinivasan. Scheduling and Routing for Demand Responsive Transit Operations. (Under the direction of Dr. John W. Baugh and Dr. John R. Stone.)The multi-vehicle dial-a-ride problem has been proven to be intractable and NP-hard. Researchers have proposed numerous techniques for furnishing approximate solutions, but most ofthese aim at conquering a single objective, such as minimization of eet size. The chosen technique must handle multiple (different or competing) objectives that characterize the problem, so that it may lend itself as a tool in transit research. This thesis explores a new technique based on the cluster-first, route-second strategy, where the multiple competing objectives of the dial-a-ride problem are successfully addressed. The key highlights in this technique are the development of different routers for different stages of the optimization, and organism filters to guide the population of prospective solutions in the clustering phase of the optimization. Application and comparison to case study data indicate that the techniques developed outperform a commercial scheduling package in generating optimal schedules, and lend themselves to configuration and customization in order tosimulate different scenarios, which help in selecting demand-responsive transit policies.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010726-020504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nature of Resistance and Response of Sweetpotato to Sweetpotato Virus Disease</field><field name="creator">Mwanga, Robert O.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTSweetpotato virus disease (SPVD) is a devastating disease due to the dual infection and synergistic interaction of sweetpotato feathery mottle potyvirus (SPFMV) and sweetpotato chlorotic stunt crinivirus (SPCSV). This study was conducted to: 1) determine the inheritance of resistance to SPVD in sweetpotato; 2) estimate the nature of genetic variance; and 3) evaluate methods for screening large populations for resistance to SPVD. The genetic basis of resistance to SPVD was investigated in three studies. The first genetic study consisted of a randomized block design at two sites in Uganda, during 1998-2000, using 45 full-sib diallel (half) families of 10 parental clones varying in SPVD resistance. The second study also conducted in Uganda, examined progeny from 15 promising sweetpotato diallel families (1352 genotypes), while the third examined two of the most promising families (294 genotypes) from the same diallel at the International Potato Center (CIP), Lima, Peru. Genetic component analysis of the 45 diallel families showed significant general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects for resistance to SPVD. GCA to SCA variance components ratios were large (0.51-0.87) and resistant parents exhibited high GCA, indicating that additive gene effects were predominant in the inheritance of resistance to SPVD and recovery. Use of a suitable sweetpotato genotype for increase of SPVD inoculum and modified cleft graft inoculation led to rapid progress in screening large populations for SPVD resistance. The distribution of SPVD scores in the promising families was skewed toward highly susceptible categories, in Uganda and Peru. Inoculation of the two families at CIP with either SPCSV or SPFMV, and Mendelian segregation analysis for resistant versus susceptible categories for the two viruses suggest that resistance to SPCSV and SPFMV is conditioned by two, separate recessive genes. In the proposed model for inheritance, the two genes are unlinked and they are inherited in a hexasomic or tetradisomic manner. Based on amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and quantitative trait (QTL) loci analyses we identified two AFLP unlinked markers associated with loci conferring resistance to SPCSV and SPFMV in these progenies. We propose spcsv1 and spfmv1 to be the names of the genes. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010726-134730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Advertising of Prescription Medications on the World Wide Web: Assessing the Communication of Risks and Benefits.</field><field name="creator">Vigilante, William John Jr.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Recently, pharmaceutical manufacturers have begun using direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements to convey prescription medication information directly to consumers. The current research explores several factors that may influence the communication of risk and benefit information in DTC advertisements on the World Wide Web (WWW). Specifically, this study focused on the effects of integrating and separating risk and benefit information at different levels of a DTC prescription medication advertisement web site hierarchy. The study also examined how risk/benefit information placement was affected by a user?s information processing objective (IPO) or task type. IPO was manipulated by requiring participants to either perform a general browsing task or a search and find task. To extend the generalizability of the results, two prescription medication DTC advertisement web sites were used in the study.&lt;p&gt;Risk and benefit recall, recognition, time-on-task, amount of information found, web site click rates, and risk-noticability ratings were measured to compare the effects of integrating and separating the risk and benefit information on the same web page and on different web pages at different levels of a DTC medication advertisement web site, task type, and drug.&lt;p&gt;Results from the current study indicated that risk and benefit information was found faster, with less clicks, and remembered more often when it is placed higher in the web site hierarchy, and presented in separate sections. The pattern of results for the two tasks used in the current study was similar and no significant differences were found between the two drugs. Participant ratings indicated a strong preference for risk information placed separate from other information on the home page. Finally, participants who were more experienced with surfing the web and online shopping tended to have better performance scores.&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that the current U.S. Federal regulations regarding DTC prescription medication advertisements, that require a balanced presentation of risk and benefit information, do not account for the effects of other variables such as information accessibility and placement. The lack of information placement guidelines can result in risk and benefit information placement on DTC prescription medication web sites that hinder a consumer's ability to find and read important drug information.&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study provides a list of guidelines that can be used in the development of a DTC prescription medication web site: present separate risk and benefit information sections; present risk and benefits on the top half of a drug's home page; if required, place the risks on a second level page with a prominent link placed in the top half of a drug's home page; consistently place important drug information across web site advertisements; use simple wording and grammar to describe important information; employ basic web usability techniques to evaluate the design of all prescription medication web sites to ensure that important drug information is easily noticed, read, and remembered.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010731-123749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing an Emotional Culture in An Intentional Community</field><field name="creator">Holden, Daphne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The central focus of my dissertation is the process through which people construct and strategically use an emotional culture as an interactional resource. My research is based on three years of fieldwork observing an intentional community's business meetings, retreats, workdays, and social events, as well as interviews with all community members. For many of the community's therapeutic founding members, intense, unconstrained processing was a self-developmental end in itself. They took from therapeutic discourse the idea that it is only through unearthing true feelings that one can hope to process childhood pain and find one's true self. However, other members were interested in the community for political or environmental reasons and didn't like intense therapeutic processing. I show how these differences among members led to micropolitical struggles over community structure, focus, and definition. Therapeutic members had the most control over the emotional culture, creating a context in which there was an unacknowledged stigma attached to not sharing emotions and reproducing the idea that "authenticity" meant appearing out of control. I showed how they then used therapeutic discourse as a resource to preserve a therapeutic emotional culture in which they were seen as the most proficient and brave. The unintended consequences of their use of this therapeutic discourse were to exclude or discredit other perspectives, to shield the current context from critical examination, and to create an emotional double standard for men and women. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010731-150641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive behavior and interference in the functional response of predator to prey</field><field name="creator">Skalski, Garrick Tyson</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The behavior of individuals in predator-prey interactions plays a fundamental role in population ecology and evolution. Accordingly, the development and assessment of theory that provides a conceptual framework for understanding and predicting behavior in predator-prey systems is of basic importance. This dissertation is focused on developing and assessing theory that provides a quantitative structure for predator-prey interactions.Chapter 1 provides a theoretical treatment of the problem of modeling the behavior of an animal facing two- and three-way tradeoffs among growth, mortality and reproduction, three components of Darwinian fitness. In this situation benefits in terms of one fitness component can be obtained only with a cost in terms of another fitness component. Applying a dynamic optimization method, the theory describes the behavior of phenotypes that adaptively balance growth, mortality and reproduction in a size-structured population. One simple prediction of the theory is that non-growing adults in a stable population should behave so as to minimize the ratio of mortality rate to birth rate. A further extension of the theory using the idea of ideal-free distributions results in a prediction of a positive and linear relationship among the rates of growth, mortality and birth when measured across different habitat patches. These and other results lead to testable predictions and I discuss empirical examples of how subsets of the theory have been and can be assessed. Chapter 2 is an empirical assessment of four alternative models of the functional response of predator to prey (the per capita feeding rate of a predator) using 19 data sets from the literature. The results show that predator-dependent functional responses (i.e., forms that are functions of predator and prey abundance because of predator interference) provide better descriptions of 18 of the 19 data sets than the Holling Type II model, a commonly used prey-dependent functional response (i.e., a model that depends only on prey abundance). Hence some form of predator interference is common in these data. However, no single functional response can best describe all of the data sets. A key result is that the best-fitting predator-dependent model depends on the presence or absence of predator-dependence when prey are very abundant. Accordingly, I suggest use of the Beddington-DeAngelis or Hassell-Varley model when predator feeding rate becomes independent of predator density at high prey density, and use of the Crowley-Martin model when predator feeding rate is decreased by higher predator density even when prey density is high. These results suggest that predator-dependent functional responses should be more widely considered in the literature. Chapter 3 is an empirical assessment of four alternative optimization models of behavior for animals facing a feeding-mortality tradeoff (i.e., increases in feeding rate can be obtained only at a cost of increasing mortality rate by predation). Using lab experiments, I measured the feeding and mortality of stream fish (bluehead chubs) in the presence of varying levels of food availability and green sunfish predators. The models vary in their specifications as to how bluehead chubs might value, in terms of fitness, rates of growth and mortality. Two models that emphasize the importance of growth or mortality alone fit the data poorly, whereas the two models that balance growth and mortality adaptively provide a much better description of the data because bluehead chubs continue to feed, albeit at a reduced level, in the presence of the predator-maintained mortality hazard. A comparison of the two best-fitting models leads to the inference that reproductive value in the bluehead chub should be thought of as a function of body size and age rather than a function of body size alone. A key implication of this result is that risk-taking behavior in these fish can be quantitatively estimated using a parameter that incorporates the benefits of growth and the costs mortality into a single fitness-based metric. The metric, called the marginal rate of substitution of mortality rate for growth rate, provides a link between behavior and life history in the bluehead chub. In summary, this dissertation provides some solutions to the challenge of how to conceptualize and predict animal behavior in predator-prey settings. The emphasis is on developing and assessing alternative hypotheses in a quantitative framework. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-07-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010731-163108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VIRTUAL TOPOLOGY DESIGN FOR TRAFFIC GROOMING IN WDM NETWORKS</field><field name="creator">Dutta, Rudra</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) in optical fiber networks iswidely viewed as the technology with the potential to satisfy theever-increasing bandwidth needs of network users effectively and on asustained basis.In WDM networks, nodes are equipped with optical cross-connects(OXCs)&lt;/em&gt;, devices which can optically switch a signal on any givenwavelength from any input port to any output port.This makes it possible to establish lightpaths&lt;/em&gt; between any pair of network nodes.A lightpath is a clear channel in which the signal remainsin optical form throughout the physical path between the two endnodes.The set of lightpaths established over the fiberlinks defines a .Consequently, the problem arises of designing virtual topologies tooptimize a performance measure of interest for a set of trafficdemands.&lt;p&gt;With the deployment of commercial WDM systems, it has become apparentthat the cost of network components, especially line terminatingequipment (LTE) is the dominant cost in building optical networks, andis a more meaningful metric to optimize than, say, the number ofwavelengths.Furthermore, since the data rates at which each individual wavelengthoperates continue to increase (to OC-192 and beyond), it becomes clearthat a number of independent traffic components must be multiplexed inorder to efficiently utilize the wavelength capacity.These observations give rise to the concept of ,which refers to the techniques used to combine lower speed componentsonto available wavelengths in order to meet network design goals suchas cost minimization.

Telling interactive stories in a virtual environment seems a natural progression of the narrative. Users find virtual environments more engaging when they perceive that they have agency within those environments. The greater the sense of freedom they have over choosing and executing their own actions, the greater their sense of agency will be. However, in order to maintain the coherence of their stories, current attempts at interactive narrative environments often limit a users sense of agency by restricting his ability to affect critical elements of the story. The process of mediation is designed to give users as great a sense of agency in an unfolding narrative as possible while still maintaining the narrative's coherence and goals. This is accomplished by making the system, user, and author collaborators in the production of the storyline. This collaboration takes the form of a mediation system constantly rewriting the narrative within the confines of the author's goals as the user interacts with characters and objects in the virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation assumes that an effective narrative storyline can be modeled by a fully ordered series of actions (know as a plan) performed by one or more virtual characters in a virtual environment. A mediation system is composed of three primary components: a speculative planner, a decision cache data structure, and an execution monitor. The speculative planner is constantly analyzing the storyline to determine what actions a user could perform that would prevent the storyline from reaching its end. For each such action it utilizes a narrative planner to determine if the storyline can be rewritten around the action or if the action must be prevented. One way of realistically preventing an action is modeled by failure modes. Failure modes are alternative actions that can be substituted by the system when necessary for user-attempted actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decisions of the speculative planner are stored in the decision cache data structure that is used by the execution monitor. The execution monitor observes users in the virtual environment and the actions they perform. If any user attempts an action in the decision cache, the execution monitor alerts the speculative planner and takes preventive action if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediation is a prime candidate for use in narrative environments that require a great deal of user interaction and freedom. Most notable are entertainment and educational systems. More generally, mediation concepts can be applied to many varying collaborative application environments, such as on-screen agents that advise or assist users in the achievement of goals. Mediation frees users from the limitations of a system's author's ability to predict all combinations of actions a user may wish to perform in a virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work we describe a prototype of the execution monitor component of mediation that has been implemented in Mimesis, a virtual environment architecture designed for interactive narrative [37].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010803-153815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Summary Representation for Service Discovery Protocols</field><field name="creator">ULLANATT, VENUGOPALAN</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in technology have led to the widespread deployment of computational resources and network-enabled end-devices. This poses new challenges to network engineers: how to locate a particular service or device out of hundreds of thousands of accessible services and devices. One of the major issues involved is the efficient storage, retrieval and dissemination of information about available services. Well known relational database techniques are not very efficient in these situations because our primary concern is the determination of availability of a service, not the retrieval of data. Also, database techniques involve additional overhead for indexing and query processing. We propose a novel scheme for efficient determination of the availability of services called SRDP(SummaryRepresentation for service Discovery Protocols). SRDP makes use of a sub-string search algorithm based on hashing techniques. For this purpose, service descriptions are treated as strings and queries are treated as sub-strings. Information about each service and its attributes is stored as a 128 bit signature in a hash table. To exploit all bits of the signature, a signature creation scheme using the characteristics of the distribution of characters in English language is employed. For the hash table, a Fibonacci hash based scheme and a CRC hash based scheme using primitive polynomials are tested for their effectiveness as hash functions. Results are presented from tests performed using actual URL data obtained from the Internet. Finally we compare the performance and memory requirements of our scheme with a Bloom-filter based approach. Results show that SRDP executes twice as fast, consumes 80% less memory and still provides false drop probabilities comparable to a Bloom filter based approach.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-06</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010803-162357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ESTIMATING CAUSAL TREATMENT EFFECTS VIA THE PROPENSITY SCORE AND ESTIMATING SURVIVAL DISTRIBUTIONS IN CLINICAL TRIALS THAT FOLLOW TWO-STAGE RANDOMIZATION DESIGNS</field><field name="creator">Lunceford, Jared Kenneth</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;LUNCEFORD, JARED KENNETH. Estimating Causal Treatment Effects Via thePropensity Score and Estimating Survival Distributions in Clinical TrialsThat Follow Two-stage Randomization Designs. (Under the direction ofProfessor Marie Davidian)Estimation of treatment effects with causalinterpretation from obervational data is complicated by the fact thatexposure to treatment is confounded with subject characteristics. Thepropensity score, the probability of exposure to treatment conditionalon covariates, is the basis for two competing classes of approachesfor adjusting for confounding: methods based on stratification ofobservations by quantiles of estimated propensity scores, and methodsbased on weighting individual observations by weights depending onestimated propensity scores. We review these approaches andinvestigate their relative performance.Some clinical trials follow a design in which patientsare randomized to a primary therapy upon entry followed by anotherrandomization to maintenance therapy contingent upon diseaseremission. Ideally, analysis would allow different treatmentpolicies, i.e. combinations of primary and maintenance therapy ifspecified up-front, to be compared. Standard practice is to conductseparate analyses for the primary and follow-up treatments, which doesnot address this issue directly. We propose consistent estimators ofthe survival distribution and mean survival time for each treatmentpolicy in such two-stage studies and derive large sampleproperties. The methods are demonstrated on a leukemia clinical trialdata set and through simulation.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010803-202112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fatigue Performance Evaluation of WesTrack Asphalt Mixtures Based on Viscoelastic Analysis of Indirect Tensile Test</field><field name="creator">Wen, Haifang</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This dissertation presents the viscoelastic characterization of asphalt concrete in indirect tensile testing and the development of a simple performance test for fatigue cracking.

Quantitative Analysis of Variability and Uncertainty in On-Road and Non-Road Mobile Source Emission Factors. (Under the direction of Dr. H Christopher Frey.) The goal of this research is to demonstrate a methodology for quantifying variability and uncertainty in mobile source emissions. Emission factors and emission estimates are subject to both variability and uncertainty. Variability in emissions deals with real differences in emissions among multiple emission sources at any given time or over time for any individual emission source. Variability is the heterogeneity of values of a quantity with respect time space or across a population. Uncertainty in emissions on the other hand implies the lack of knowledge regarding the true value of emissions. In this research variability and uncertainty are treated separately since their sources are different and as such they affect the decision making process in a different way. For example, sources of variability in mobile source emissions include: vehicle make; ambient temperature; vehicle model; fuel used; vehicle age; and/or driving behavior. Sources of uncertainty may include: small sample sizes; lack of precision and/or accuracy in measurements; non-representativeness; or lack of data. In this work a methodology for simultaneous characterization of variability and uncertainty in mobile source emission factors is described. Variability is characterized by fitting probability distributions to the data sets. Uncertainty due to random sampling error is characterized by using the parametric Bootstrap technique.This methodology is demonstrated for emission factors for three categories: (1) Onroad mobile source exhaust air toxic emissions (2) nonroad lawn and garden equipment emissions and (3) nonroad construction farm and industrial equipment emissions. For the first category a database of vehicular exhaust emissions developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) was used. For the second and third categories emission factor databases were developed by reviewing reports and/or technical papers from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), CARB and Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).The main results regarding the demonstrated methodology and related statistical analysis in this research include: (1) emission factor groupings were determined statistically (e.g. by engine size for lawn and garden engines); (2) substantial inter-engine variability in emissions was discovered; and (3) large ranges of uncertainty in mean emissions were found in many cases. In particular, uncertainty ranges for the mean emission factors were in excess of &#177;20 percent in most cases and as high as minus 49 percent to plus 89 percent.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010806-122200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermal and Non-Thermal Emission in Supernova Remnants</field><field name="creator">Dyer, Kristy Kathleen</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Supernova remnants present an excellent opportunity to study the shockacceleration of relativistic particles. X-ray synchrotron emission fromrelativistic electrons should contain important information, butextracting it requires advances in models and observations. I present thefirst test of sophisticated synchrotron models against high resolutionobservations on SN 1006, the first and best example of synchrotron X-rayemission, which has been well observed at radio, X-ray and gamma-raywavelengths. Synchrotron emission can be limited at the highest energies by finite age,radiative losses or electron escape. Earlier calculations suggested thatSN 1006 was escape limited. I adapted an escape-limited synchrotron modelfor XSPEC, and demonstrated that it can account for the dominantlynonthermal integrated spectrum of SN 1006 observed by ASCA-GIS and RXTEwhile constraining the values of the maximum electron energy and otherparameters. Combined with TeV observations, the fits give a mean postshockmagnetic field strength of 9 microgauss and 0.7% of the supernova energyin relativistic electrons. Simultaneous thermal fits gave abundances farabove solar, as might be expected for ejecta but had not previously beenobserved. I created subsets of the escape-limited model to fit spatially resolvedASCA SIS observations. I found only small differences between thenortheast and southwest limbs. A limit of less than 9% was placed on theamount of nonthermal flux elsewhere in the remnant. Important findingsinclude the possibility that rolloff frequency may change across theremnant face, and ruling out cylindrical symmetry for SN 1006 along aNW/SE axis. These models have implications far beyond SN 1006. The only previousmodel available to describe X-ray synchrotron emission was a powerlaw.These new models are superior to powerlaws both for their robustconstraints and because they shed physical insight on the accelerationmechanism. As new instruments increase our spatial and spectral resolutionI predict many more remnants will be found with varying amounts of X-raysynchrotron emission, hidden along with thermal lines and continuum. Theability to separate thermal and nonthermal emission is essential tounderstanding both nonthermal emission as well as the thermal component.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010806-162918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and Design of Microstrip antenna for a Smart-antenna test-bed</field><field name="creator">Venugopal, Arvind</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Small planar antennas are becoming increasingly popular in personal wireless communication systems since these antennas offer advantages such as small size,light weight, robust construction, ease of integration into mobile handsets, reasonable radiation efficiency and gain.

Analysis of Thermal Conductivity in Composite Adhesives (Under the direction of H. Thomas Banks). Thermally conductive composite adhesives are desirable in many industrial applications, including computers, microelectronics, machinery and appliances. These composite adhesives are formed when a filler particle of high conductivity is added to a base adhesive. Typically, adhesives are poor thermal conductors. Experimentally only small improvements in the thermal properties of the composite adhesives over the base adhesives have been observed. A thorough understanding of heat transfer through a composite adhesive would aid in the design of a thermally conductive composite adhesive that has the desired thermal properties.In this work, we study design methodologies for thermally conductive composite adhesives. We present a three dimensional model for heat transfer through a composite adhesive based on its composition and on the experimental method for measuring its thermal properties. For proof of concept, we reduce our model to a two dimensional model. We present numerical solutions to our two dimensional model based on a composite silicone and investigate the effect of the particle geometry on the heat flow through this composite. We also present homogenization theory as a tool for computing the ``effective thermal conductivity" of a composite material.We prove existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence theorems for our two dimensional model. We formulate a parameter estimation problem for the two dimensional model and present numerical results. We first estimate the thermal conductivity parameters as constants, and then use a probability based approach to estimate the parameters as realizations of random variables. A theoretical framework for the probability based approach is outlined.Based on the results of the parameter estimation problem, we are led to formally derive sensitivity equations for our system. We investigate the sensitivity of our composite silicone with respect to the thermal conductivity of both the base silicone polymer and the filler particles. Numerical results of this investigation are also presented. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010808-130536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamentals of Fiber Dispersion in Water</field><field name="creator">Jayachandran, Amit</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of this project was to provide fundamental knowledge of fiber dispersion in water to the wet-lay nonwoven textile industry and set up the tools required to develop apparatus and analysis methods capable of predicting whether a given fiber, fiber blend or white water chemistry will provide a uniform, defect free fabric on commercial scale, wet lay nonwoven machines.Fluent 5.0 (CFD software) has been used to characterize fluid flow in a turbulent mixing tank, understand the effects of addition and modification of baffles and describe the motional behavior of fiber-representative particles in this flow domain.

Electrical Characterization of TiSi2 Nanoscale Islands by ScanningProbe Microscopy. (Under the direction of Robert J. Nemanich)Using conducting tip atomic force microscopy (c-AFM), we have measured thecurrent voltage characteristics of individual sub-micron islands of TiSi2 on Si(100)surfaces and we have developed an imaging approach that distinguishes the electricalproperties of the islands. The Schottky barrier height (SBH) of the sub-micron TiSi2islands was deduced from the I-V measurements. The results indicate that there is asignificant variation of SBH among the islands on the same surface. The measurementsemploy a conventional AFM with a heavily B-doped diamond tip to obtain the currentvoltagerelations. In contact mode AFM, electrical signals are extracted independentlyfrom the topographic image. In addition, we have developed a new imaging method toprobe the local electrical properties of a surface with regions of different conductivity.Using a lock-in technique both phase and amplitude images were obtained, and theresultant image is essentially a map of the differential surface conductivity. Using thismethod, TiSi2 islands on a Si(100) surface were imaged. This approach can be readilyextended to other materials systems.Nanoscale TiSi2 islands of lateral diameter of ~5 nm are formed by electron beamdeposition of a few monolayers of titanium on atomically clean Si(111)7x7 surfacefollowed by in situ annealing at high temperatures (800-1000&#161;&#198;C). Direct probing of theelectrical characteristics of these islands was performed using ultra high vacuumscanning tunneling microscope (UHV-STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS).&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010810-153432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational geometric analysis and planning for 3D rapid prototyping processes</field><field name="creator">Koc, Bahattin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;KOC, BAHATTIN Computational geometric analysis and planning for 3D rapid prototyping processes. (Under the direction of Professor Yuan-Shin Lee)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this research, computational geometric analysis and planning methods are developed for rapid prototyping (RP) processes. To increase the accuracy of the slicing contours from the STL file, biarc curve fitting of the linear contours has been developed. The mathematics formulation and a Max-Fit algorithm have been developed to find the best biarc curve fitting of the STL slicing data points. Max-Fit biarc fitting algorithm progresses through all the points on the slicing contour data to find an efficient biarc fitting. The results show that rough cross-sectional contours from the STL models can be smoothed with the developed method of Max-Fit biarc. Therefore, less strict requirements on the STL triangulation tolerance can be used when the STL model is generated for rapid prototyping. To increase the efficiency of the rapid prototyping process, non-uniform offsetting and hollowing of solid objects by using biarcs fitting have been developed. The developed non-uniform offsetting method can reduce the area that needs to be built so the total RP build time can be reduced significantly. Using the developed method can also reduce the expensive build material usage. The hollowed objects with constant wall thickness are constructed by offsetting the vertices in their corresponding normal directions. To reduce the staircase effect in the 2D layers of RP processes, a new approach of ruled layer approximation of STL models has been developed. A surface error analysis method has been developed for the proposed ruled layer approximation. Using the surface error assessment, the STL model can be sliced adaptively to reduce the total number of layers without sacrificing the required surface accuracy. To fabricate the ruled layers, the material removal process, specifically 5-axis machining, is integrated into the traditional 2D RP processes. The tool paths are generated for the ruled layers to machine the thick layers fabricated by a traditional RP process. Computer implementation and illustrative examples of the proposed methods are also presented in this dissertation. The results show the developed methods can significantly increase the accuracy and the efficiency of RP processes. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010812-030632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voluntary Conservation: Private landowner participation in North Carolina's Natural Heritage Program (spatial analysis of the Natural Heritage Program in North Carolina)</field><field name="creator">Cassingham, Kirsten Michaele</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Conflict between the public interests in non-timber amenities of forests and the private rights of forest owners has focused attention on voluntary conservation agreements as a policy tool.

Evaluation of the program from a spatial perspective focused on the mountain province of North Carolina, using a geographic information system (GIS) to characterize the conservation outcome of the program (i.e., what has been conserved) and the determinants of participation in the program (i.e., who has conserved). To characterize the participation decision, literature was reviewed on voluntary forest stewardship and conservation programs and spatial analysis of land-use. The effect of neighborhood characteristics (e.g., near-by protected areas) and distance (e.g., from highways and cities) was considered, as well as characteristics of the landowner and of the site.

Analysis of RNase P Structure and Function. (Under the direction of James W. Brown.) The diversity of Archaea in municipal wastewater sludge was investigated by amplification of rRNA sequences from sludge DNA using archaeal-specific primers. The most common sequences were extreme halophiles; also found were sequence members of environmental euryarchaeal and crenarchaeal groups. Only distant relatives of Methanosarcina among the Methanomicrobiales were found.A detailed comparative analysis of archaeal RNase P RNA structure and a comparison of the resulting structural information with that of the bacterial RNA reveals that the archaeal RNase P RNAs are strikingly similar to those of Bacteria. The differences between the secondary structure models of archaeal and bacterial RNase P have largely disappeared, and even variation in the sequence and structure in the RNAs are similar in extent and type. The structure of the cruciform (P7-P11) has been reevaluated on the basis of a total of 321 bacterial and archaeal sequences, leading to a model for the structure of this region of the RNA that includes an extension to P11 that consistently organizes the cruciform and adjacent highly-conserved sequences. Archaeal and bacterial RNase P RNAs are very similar in sequence and secondary structure, but in the absence of protein, the archaeal RNAs are much less active and require extreme ionic conditions. In order to assess how readily the activity of the archaea RNA alone could be improved by point mutations in its sequence, in vitro selection was used to generate variants of the self-cleaving conjugant Methanobacterium formicicum: B. subtilus tRNAAsp (cpTP). Functional variants were generated with a broad spectrum of mutations that were predominately consistent with natural variation in this RNA. Variants generated from the selection were only comparable to wildtype in catalytic activity; more performed significantly faster at lower ionic strength. These results suggest that the archaeal RNase P RNA is globally optimized and that the protein may play larger compensatory roles in catalysis than previously thought. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-21</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010821-140212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CO2 Enrichment and Hot Water Heat in a Greenhouse as a Mean of Recovering Bioresources From Swine Waste</field><field name="creator">Marbis, Juan Manuel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTMarbis, Juan M. CO2 Enrichment and Hot Water Heat in a Greenhouse as a Mean of Recovering Bioresources From Swine Waste. (Under the direction of Daniel H. Willits) Predictions of heating and cooling requirements of a greenhouse located at the Barham Farm, Zebulon, N.C. were made via computer simulation. Kimball?s Modular Energy Balance Model (MEB) was used to simulate thermal behavior of the greenhouse. The weather inputs to the model were provided by data collected at the greenhouse and a Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) data file for Raleigh, NC. Greenhouse air temperature (Tai), inside CO2 concentration (CO2) and inside relative humidity (RH) levels were used to validate the accuracy of the model. Absolute percentage differences ranging from 5.92% to 10.67% for Tai were observed. CO2 levels showed the biggest differences between observed and predicted data, from 14.93% to 42.33%, and RH showed a difference of 9.79% to 19.41%. Heating times were under-predicted, showing percentage difference between observed and predicted periods from -3.01% to -34.87%. On the other hand, cooling periods were over-predicted. With the exception of the month of February were cooling periods were under-predicted. Percentage difference for cooling periods ranged from -3.59% to 27.80%. The use of supplemental heat using a 10,000 gallon hot water tank serving as a waste heat collector was simulated. No data was available on its operation. Based on specific operating assumptions, it is expected that heat from the hot water will supply approximately 35% of the total energy demand of the greenhouse in a typical meteorological year. It was observed that the use of supplemental heat is most sensitive to its initial water temperature and the cutoff temperature. Outside weather conditions to which the use of hot water is most sensitive are solar radiation and wind speed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-23</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010822-165338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unit Root Tests in Panel Data: Weighted Symmetric Estimation and Maximum Likelihood Estimation</field><field name="creator">Kim, Hyunjung</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;There has been much interest in testing nonstationarity of panel data in the econometric literature.

Experimental and Nonlinear FEA Investigation of Elbows Leading to a New Definition of The B2 Stress Index (Under the supervision of Dr. Vernon C. Matzen).This study suggests a new margin-consistent procedure for the calculation of the B2 stress index for any piping component, which is the ratio of the collapse moment of a corresponding straight pipe to the collapse moment of the piping component. It gives a B2 value of 1.00 when applied to a straight pipe and a safety margin for the component that is always the same as for the straight pipe. An example of using this definition to calculate the value of B2 is provided. To obtain the collapse moments of piping components, either finite element analysis (FEA) or experiments can be used. This work gives a brief review of nonlinear FEA modeling procedures. Then nonlinear FEA using ANSYS shell models and ABAQUS elbow models are used to simulate two tests on straight pipes and eight tests on elbows under in-plane closing, in-plane opening and out-of-plane bending. Constitutive models and welding effects are discussed. All correlations between FEA and measured experimental results for the load-displacement curves are excellent. It is concluded that nonlinear FEA using ANSYS SHELL181 and ABAQUS ELBOW31 can give quite accurate predictions of the global behavior of elbows and straight pipes under monotonic loading.

One point that complicates this issue is the ability to discriminate between EEM and infertile eggs. Therefore, there has always been a question about the accuracy of the reported number of infertile eggs. A study was designed to examine the hatch residue from turkey flocks of the same strain at two different ages. One flock was in its first two weeks of egg production and the second flock had been in production for at least 12 weeks. Six hatches with approximately 56,000 eggs total for all hatches combined were examined by macroscopic breakout. There were no differences in fertility or hatchability between the two different hen ages. EEM was greater in younger hens than in older hens. EM occurring during the last week of incubation was greater in older hens than in younger hens. A significant negative correlation was found between fertility and EEM in young hens suggesting that practices that could improve fertility may also minimize EEM. The difference between the two hen ages provided a model to further examine embryonic mortality in turkeys. Preliminary results from commercial resources indicated lower EM after hens were inseminated with higher numbers of sperm cells. It was hypothesized that sperm binding might differ between hen ages and that increasing the number of sperm in the insemination might compensate for lower binding. A study was designed to examine the sperm penetration (SP) of hens at two stages of egg production: the beginning of egg production and wk 12 of egg production. Using both in vivo and in vitro SP assays, the results indicated a larger number of SP holes in the perivitelline layer of the young hens when compared to older hens. The similarity between the in vivo and in vitro assays indicated a sperm binding effect independent of oviduct influences such as sperm storage and release rate. Another study was conducted to examine the female influence on SP and EEM in turkeys. Eggs from females of two different lines were examined at the two different ages examined in the previous studies. Females were mated to a single sire for the duration of the study to examine IPVL SP in the absence of sperm competition among different males. Eggs were used for either in vivo SP analysis or incubated for fertility, hatchability and EM data. Hens inseminated by a singe sire performed differently between the two age periods as demonstrated by a hen by period interaction. The response was inconsistent whereas some hens had increased SP holes, some decreased and some did not change between the two different age periods. Hens in the upper (HI) and lower (LO) third of the flock population based on SP holes were pooled in analyzing sperm hole effects on embryo viability. No differences in fertility or wk 1 mortality were detected between HI and LO hens. However, HI hens had higher hatchability and lower wk 4 EM compared to LO hens. In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated a significant female effect on SP. Furthermore, this effect appears to be due to unknown differences in IPVL properties as well as differences due to sperm storage and release rate from the sperm storage tubules. More research is needed to understand how the number of sperm cells relates to both early and late EM. These studies indicate that neither a high nor a low SP number, but that an intermediate number might result in optimal embryo survival.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-08-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010831-083438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors Influencing Semen Quality and Fertility in Boars</field><field name="creator">Poolperm, Pariwat</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POOLPERM, PARIWAT.&#160; Factors Influencing Semen Quality and Fertilityin Boars.

Weld integrates speculative multithreading support into a VLIW/EPIC processor to hide run-time latency effects that cannot be determined by the compiler. Also, it proposes a hardware technique called operation welding that merges operations from different threads to utilize the hardware resources more efficiently. Hardware contexts such as program counters and the fetch units are duplicated to support multithreading. Also, a dual-thread Weld architecture is isolated and analyzed for cost/performance purposes within the general Weld architecture. The dual-thread Weld model supports one main thread and one speculative thread running simultaneously in a VLIW/EPIC processor with a register file and a fetch unit per thread. The cost/performance impact of the dual-thread Weld model, which includes analysis of migrating the disambiguation hardware to the compiler and the sensitivity analysis to the variation of branch misprediction and second-level cache miss penalties, is examined further. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010904-132307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Multipath Traffic Allocation in TCP/IP Networks</field><field name="creator">Elhaddad, Mahmoud Shawky</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Elhaddad, Mahmoud Shawky. Adaptive Multipath Traffic Allocation in TCP/IP Networks.(Under the direction of Dr. Injong Rhee and Dr. Munindar Singh)Balancing network traffic among multiple paths connecting ingress-egress pairspromises better utilization of network links and improved servicequality for user-flows.Research into optimized adaptive traffic allocation yielded techniquesthat tradeoff convergence speed to stability and/or fail to incorporate knowledgeabout the behavior of congestion control mechanisms, making their evaluationa difficult, if possible task -- both analytically and experimentally.In this thesis, we consider load balancing in multipath IP networks where thenumber of flows between ingress-egress pairs is a slow-changing process andTCP-friendliness is adopted-by or imposed-on all flows. Provided that packetordering is preserved, we present an analytical characterization of the throughput-optimalfractional allocations of flow packets in terms of the TCP-fair share alongeach candidate path; and show that optimally splitting all network flows resultsin efficient and globally fair sharing of network resources. For the estimationof the fair share along network paths, we demonstrate that TCP-fairness in sharingbottleneck bandwidth can be modeled as weighted max-min, where the weight vectorcorresponds to the Bulk Transfer Capacity (BTC) of the bottlenecked path. Policingat the ingress routers limits connections to their computed fair rates, therebyeliminating TCP bias against connections passing through multiple bottlenecksand minimizing packet losses at internal routers. Given minimal loss rate andsmall bounded delay skew among alternative paths, packet resequencing at theegress routers can be applied effectively.We also introduce AMTA -- a centralized traffic allocation service for MPLSnetworks based on the optimality and fairness results described above, and extendedto handle flows with limited throughput demand. The robustness of AMTA underrelevant scenarios is demonstrated through simulations.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-05</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010904-162802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the protein component of Methanococcus jannaschii RNase P</field><field name="creator">Bates, Ginger</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;RNase P is the ribonuclease responsible for the 5? maturation of precursor transfer RNA (pre-tRNA). In Bacteria RNase P is composed of a single 14kDa protein accompanied by a single catalytic RNA subunit that is capable of cleave pre-tRNA without the protein cofactor in vitro. The RNA subunit of archaeal RNase P resembles those found in Bacteria, however holoenzymes characterized from the Archaea indicate that the accompanying protein component is much larger than in the bacterial enzyme. Purified RNase P from the Euryarchaeon Methanococcus jannaschii possesses approximately eight protein subunits and has an RNA that is incapable of cleaving pre-tRNA alone in vitro. Four putative M. jannaschii RNase P proteins have been identified by their similarity to RNase P proteins of Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus. Here we confirm the presence of two of these proteins, MJ0464 and MJ1139, as well as the presence of several other hypothetical proteins (MJ0332.1, MJ0376, MJ1128, and MJ1625), two 30S ribosomal protein subunits (S6E and S8E), and a nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase in M. jannaschii RNase P preparations. Eukaryotic RNase P holoenzymes also contain multiple protein subunits and it is thought that these "extra" proteins are required for function in the increased compartmentalization of the eukaryotic cell. Archaeal cells do not have the distinct compartmentalization seen in eukaryotic cells and it is unclear what purpose the protein subunits described here would have in vivo. One possibility is protein-substrate interactions to facilitate formation of the substrate-enzyme complex. M. jannaschii RNase P RNA lacks certain secondary structures present in E. coli RNase P RNA that have been shown in the bacterial model to interact with pre-tRNA substrate. Archaeal RNase P RNAs that possess these elements, such as that of M. thermoautotrophicus, are capable of cleaving substrate in vitro without protein, although only at very high salt concentration. M. jannaschii RNase P RNA does not have any extra secondary structural elements to compensate for the lack of substrate binding helices and it is possible that the protein component has evolved to assume these responsibilities. In order to test this hypothesis, circularly permuted transfer RNAs containing a photoagent positioned in the T loop were used in ultra-violet cross-linking reactions.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010905-163839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of Lignin Sensor for Identification of Paper Grades for an Automatic Waste Paper SortingSystem.</field><field name="creator">Ammineni, Chandini Muniratnam</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AMMINENI, CHANDINI MUNIRATNAM.

Development of a perceptual Visualization assitant for multi-dimensionaldata visualizations. (Under the direction of Christopher G.

ViA focuses on (1) how to construct visualizations in an application-independent manner, (2) how to produce visualizations that support effectiveexploration, discovery, and analysis, and (3) how to allow users to participate in this processto guarantee the resulting visualizations respect context and user preferences. Tosolve these issues we propose guidelines based on studies of human vision and human perception.Evaluation engines built from these guidelines will be used to evaluate the dataattribute to visual feature mappings in a given visualization. The results (evaluationweights and hints for improvement) will be used by a mixed-initiative search algorithm toidentify new visualizations with high potential for improvement. This allows ViA to selectivelysearch for the best possible visualizations for a user?s dataset and analysis tasks.ViA allows user interaction during the search process by asking whether certain simplifyingassumptions can be made, and by allowing users to specify requirements and constraintsfor the visualizations ViA suggests. We tested ViA?s abilities in two practicalapplication environments: weather data and e-commerce auction traces. Results from asubjective user questionnaire suggest that ViA?s visualizations are as good or better thanexisting standards used to represent this type of data.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010912-164511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE 2000 NC STATE FOOTBALL SEASON ON WAKE COUNTY, NC</field><field name="creator">Pearson, Bryant</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to objectively assess the economic impact of the 2000 NC State football season on Wake County. Data were collected from several sources to yield an accurate assessment of the economic impact of NC State football on its host community. These sources included: 1) visitor travel and expenditure data, 2) NC State football expenditure data, and 3) relevant data from Wake County. Visitor data were obtained by using two separate samples and surveys. A 20-item questionnaire was mailed to 1,000 randomly selected 2000 NC State football season ticket holders that reside outside of Wake County. In a separate convenience sample, another 1,200 subjects were administered a 12-itmem questionnaire at the Duke game on November 11, 2000. SPSS was then used to generate frequency distributions and summary statistics for the visitors in both samples. NC State football data were supplied by the NC State Athletics Department, and relevant Wake County data were retrieved from several different sources. The economic impact model used in this study (LOCI- Local Area Impact Model) used both local level data and input-output methods to determine the direct, indirect, and induced effects of the 2000 NC State football season on employment, income, and retail activity in Wake County. The multipliers used in this study were derived from input-output analysis of Wake County?s economy using IMPLAN Pro4, and the local level data consisted of the aforementioned visitor data, NC State football data, and relevant Wake County data. The results of the study indicated that the 2000 NC State football season generated 86 new jobs, $2,894,290 of new income, $9,096,507 of new retail spending, and $1,821,707 of new service purchases in Wake County. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010912-224517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effect of Anisotropy on In-Plane liquid Distribution in Nonwoven Fabrics</field><field name="creator">Konopka, Amy Elizabeth</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractKonopka, Amy Elizabeth. The Effect of Anisotropy on In-Plane liquid Distribution in Nonwoven Fabrics. (Under the direction of Behnam Pourdeyhimi)Anisotropy has been shown to be an influencing factor of many nonwoven structural properties such as the bending rigidity and the tensile strength. The effect on liquid distribution (a very important property in many nonwoven applications), however, has not been determined. In this study the effect on anisotropy on a material's in-plane liquid distribution is examined. By using the new NCRC GATS device, which enables the in-plane liquid distribution and the recording of the spread to occur simultaneously, it was determined that the liquid distribution was indeed influenced by the structural anisotropy. Also determined was the effect of the testing method on the wicking rate of the material. A comparison between conventional test methods and a newly developed test method, which utilizes the NCRC GATS and a hollowed plate, were made. It was determined from the results that the new method is the only method that measures the intrinsic wicking of the material.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Management and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010925-125929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PHOSPHORUS LOSS IN SURFACE RUNOFF FROM PIEDMONT SOILS RECEIVING ANIMAL MANURE AND FERTILIZER ADDITIONS</field><field name="creator">Tarkalson, David Dale</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research was to measure P losses in runoff from agricultural land in the Piedmont region of the southeastern U.S. with varying soil P levels and receiving broiler litter and inorganic P fertilizers. The experimental results will be helpful for the development of the P Loss Assessment Tool in North Carolina and other P Index approaches in states with similar soil characteristics and crop management practices. A net influx of P into many areas due to high animal populations has resulted in increased potential P losses to sensitive surface waters. A typical North Carolina broiler farm and dairy farm were found to have annual P surpluses of 65 kg P/ha and 20 kg P/ha respectively. The use of low phytic acid corn varieties and phytase enzyme has the potential to reduce the P surplus on broiler farms by 25 to 58%. Phosphorus losses in runoff from Piedmont conventional till (CT) and no-till (NT) soils with varying soil P concentrations and from soils currently receiving broiler litter and fertilizer P applications were assessed. In these studies, rainfall simulation at rates of 6 and 7.6 cm/hr were utilized to collect runoff samples from crop land with a range of initial P concentrations and from plots with varying fertilizer P and broiler litter application rates, both incorporated and broadcast. Runoff samples were collected at 5-min intervals for 30 min and analyzed for reactive P (RP), algal-available (AAP), and total P (TP). Concentration of RP in runoff from CT and NT plots was positively correlated with Mehlich-3 extractable P (r2 = 0.61 and 0.7 respectively) and oxalate extractable degree of P saturation (DPS) (r2 = 0.6 and 0.61 respectively). However, only TP mass loss (kg TP/ha) in runoff from CT was correlated with DPS (r2 = 0.57). A Mehlich 3 extractable P concentration of 350 mg P/kg and a DPS of 84% corresponded to 1 mg RP/L in runoff. Incorporation of broiler litter and inorganic P fertilizer into the soil at all P application rates virtually eliminated P runoff loses and had similar P losses in runoff as the unfertilized control. Surface application of broiler litter resulted in runoff containing between 2.9 and 24.5 mg RP/L for application rates of 8 to 82 kg P/ha respectively. Mass loss of TP in runoff from surface-applied broiler litter ranged from 1.3 to 8.5 kg P/ha over the same application rates. There was no significant relationship between surface applied inorganic P application rate and RP concentrations or TP mass losses in runoff. However, there was a trend for increased RP concentrations and TP mass losses in runoff with increasing application rate. Concentration of RP and mass loss of TP in runoff from surface applied inorganic P averaged 4.9 mg RP/L and 1.1 kg P/ha over all application rates. There was no significant difference between P losses in runoff from plots receiving surface applied conventional broiler litter and broiler litter derived from birds fed a low phytic acid corn (High Available P corn). &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010926-002603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DESIGN OF A LINEAR HIGH PRECISION ULTRASONIC PIEZOELECTRIC MOTOR</field><field name="creator">Bauer, Markus Georg</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;BAUER, MARKUS GEORG. Design of a Linear High Precision Ultrasonic Piezoelectric Motor. (Under the direction of Dr. Thomas A.Dow.)To understand the operating principles of linear ultrasonic piezoelectric motors, a motor made by Nanomotion Ltd. was examined and a model of the driving process was developed. A new motor has been designed that uses the same driving process but improves resolution, speed, efficiency and especially controllability. All designs involve at least two independently driven piezoelectric elements, one generating the normal load at the interface and the second generating the tangential driving force. The greatest challenges in developing this motor are 1) the actuator needs to have two different mode shapes at nearly the same frequency and 2) each mode shape must be exclusively excited by one actuator and not by the other. The quality of the operation of the motor directly depends on how well the excitation of both vibrations can be separated.Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used to model the actuator and predict the dynamic properties of a future prototype. The model includes all significant features that have to be considered such as the anisotropy of the piezoelectric material, the exact properties and the dimensions of the actuators (including all joints). Several prototypes have been built, and the resulting mode shapes and natural frequencies have been measured and compared to the computer models. The design concepts as well as the modeling techniques have been iteratively improved. Open loop testing has shown that the motor generates slideway motion such that the steady state slideway velocity is proportional to the excitation voltage. To fully characterize the motor and to demonstrate its full potential for positioning tasks, the motor has been tested in a closed loop control system. Despite saturation of the control input and nonlinearities in dynamics of the motor-slideway system, it was shown that a simple feedback control system using proportional gain or proportional-integrating control algorithms can be used to achieve a stable responsive positioning system.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010926-162049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and Control of Flexible Structures Supported on Active Magnetic Bearings</field><field name="creator">Jayanth, Vignesh</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The focus of this thesis is the development and demonstration of adaptive control algorithms for Active Magnetic Bearings AMBs) that account for uncertainties associated with structural vibration modes. A flexible rotor AMB test rig is designed and modeled using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The flexible modes and equations of motion are obtained using modal analysis techniques. Typically, such analyses accurately predict the low frequency modes, but accuracy at higher frequencies is greatly reduced. Adaptive control algorithms that account for parametric uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics are developed to levitate and control the flexible rotor. Model parameters for the system are identified using recursive least squares, and used to update a self-tuning pole-placement controller. This self-tuning approach dramatically improves the performance and robustness of the magnetic levitation system, as demonstrated through simulations and experimental demonstrations. The flexible rotor AMB test rig is fabricated to experimentally validate the identification and control algorithms. Results clearly demonstrate the performance and limitations of the adaptive control design.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-27</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010926-183814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Epidemiology of Multi-drug resistant Salmonella in swine production systems</field><field name="creator">Gebreyes, Wondwossen Abebe</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The swine industry is often implicated as one of the most significant contributors to foodborne Salmonella infections in humans. As the trend in swine production in the United States is toward larger and more intensive farms, but fewer farm units, it is likely that antimicrobial usage is also increasing. The purpose of this research was to study antimicrobial resistance and determine phenotypic and genotypic diversity of multi-drug resistant Salmonella in swine production systems. We found resistance to specific classes of antimicrobials including tetracycline, b-lactams and chloramphenicol to be common and stable over the study period. Over the time period of the study, we also noticed a significant shift in the patterns of multi-drug resistance, despite the fact that no change in antimicrobial usage had taken place, suggesting that other, currently unidentified selective pressures could be of significance. Bacteriophage typing also revealed that two phage types of importance to public health, DT104 and DT193, often had two predominant pentaresistance patterns. Susceptibility testing on a number of human S. Typhimurium isolates, however, revealed that multi-drug resistance was infrequent among isolates originating from humans. The findings in studying the genetic diversity of these Multi-drug resistant strains imply that vertical transmission, most likely originating from the sow farm, is an important source at the nursery stage, but that horizontal transmission of clonal groups is significant at the finishing phase. Resistance genes detected on multi-drug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT193 revealed that the resistance genes and locations are specifically different from that of DT104.Overall, the study findings show that antimicrobial resistance in the swine production environment is common and may be linked to the level of antimicrobial usage. Despite the common occurrence of public health important strains among isolates from swine, strains from humans were distinct and were less likely to be resistant to multiple antimicrobials. This area needs to be of high priority for further research to assess the risk of human Salmonella infection from swine or pork products. Further research on the genetic diversity of Salmonella also must be considered in order to identify significant factors contributing to the dissemination of multi-drug resistant Salmonella in modern swine production systems.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-09-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20010928-104421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Application of Monte Carlo Sampling to Sequential Auction Games with Incomplete Information:-An Empirical Study</field><field name="creator">ZHU, WEILI</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractWeili, Zhu. The Application of Monte Carlo Sampling to Sequential Auction Games with Incomplete Information: -An Empirical Study. (Under the direction of Peter Wurman.)In this thesis, I develop a sequential auction model and design a bidding agent for it. This agent uses Monte Carlo sampling to &#161;&#176;learn&#161;&#177; from a series sampled games. I use a game theory research toolset called GAMBIT to implement the model and collect some experimental data. The data shows the effect of different factors that impact on our agent&#161;&#175;s performance, such as the sample size, the depth of game tree, etc. The data also shows that our agent performs well compared with myopic strategic agent.

The limp parts are modeled as shells undergoing large deformations and rotations using a geometrically exact nonlinear shell finite element formulation. The strain energy is the objective function minimized and is computed from a finite element solution for the deformation of the limp part. The optimal locations are found by solving the corresponding bound constrained minimization problem using gradient based algorithms.The ability to automatically mesh the domain of the limp part determines whether the problem can be solved as a continuous problem. Meshes for one dimensional and square/rectangular two dimensional domains are automatically generated and the optimal locations are solved using continuous optimization algorithms based on the Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno (BFGS) update of the Hessian. Optimal locations for all other two dimensional domains are obtained by solving a discrete optimization problem on a fixed mesh by a new gradient based algorithm. Results are obtained for one dimensional strips and various two dimensional shapes of limp material.

(Under the direction of MichaelL. Vasu and James E. Swiss)The problem of underaged drinking and efforts to reduce it are examined in this research by: First, assessing the deterrent effect of the widely used undercover compliance check strategy. Secondarily, the predictive and explanatorypower of identified characteristics of both alcohol sales outlets and individual sellers was assessed. Data was collected using a quasi-experimental design employing compliance checks of a proportionally stratified random sample of alcohol sales outlets across North Carolina. The research objectives were to determine if compliance checks deter minor sales and to assess the utility of using identified characteristics to focus enforcement, training and industry staffing to reduce sales. Multivariate modelscombining these characteristics were constructed. They werefound to provide more information in guiding training and scheduling than in enforcement. The major findings were: thelimited-sanction compliance checks employed did not have a statistically significant deterrent effect on future sales;minor sales violations are independent of other ABC offenses;a baseline of a 25% sale to minor rate was established; past enforcement does not predict future offending; present training efforts are not significantly associated with reduced sales; citizen complaints are not associated with actual sales; values of the seller-specific variables are difficult to ascertain and provide little enforcement guidance, but do guide training and staffing; ownership variables are associated with lower sales rates; sellers age16-21 sell at lower rates than other similarly constructed categories; and many of the traditional beliefs of law enforcement were not confirmed. The study concludes recommending: continuing compliance checks; placing less emphasis on investigating complaints and using complaints asa basis to partner with the industry; update training programs; license sellers, with training being a prerequisite; changing the administrative punishment structure to make it more equitable and establishing a minimum age to sell alcohol. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Administration</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011010-191219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global phase diagram for monomer/dimer mixtures</field><field name="creator">Attwood, Brian Christopher</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The objective of this thesis is to calculate the global phase diagram predicted by the Generalized Flory Dimer equation of state for mixtures of square-well monomers and dimers. Towards that goal, we first extend the Generalized Flory Dimer (GFD) theory for hard sphere monomer/dimer mixtures to square-well monomer/dimer mixtures. Theoretical predictions for the compressibility factor as a function of volume fraction are compared to discontinuous molecular dynamic simulation results on monomer/dimer mixtures at well depth ratios 0.5 - 1.5 and dimer mole fractions 0.111 - 0.667 and on monomers/8-mer mixtures at well depth ratios 0.5 - 1.5. Agreement is found generally to be good and consistent with the agreement obtained when the GFD theory is applied to other square-well systems. Next we calculate the GFD predicted global phase diagram for square-well monomer/dimer mixtures using a brute force method. The locus of critical points in the direction implies that monomer/dimer systems have a greater tendency towards liquid-liquid immiscibility in our system than in monomer/monomer systems.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011012-113555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELING AND INFERRING QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI USING LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM IN NATURAL POPULATIONS</field><field name="creator">WANG, TAO</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Quantitative trait loci (QTL) are those chromosome regions that contribute to variation of quantitative traits. Analysis of QTL is helpful for further study of molecular basis of the quantitative genetic variation. The discovery of highly abundant and dense polymorphic markers (e.g., single nucleotide polynorphisms, or SNPs) covering a whole genome provides an opportunity to localize QTL in a variety of populations. While classical linkage studies have a relatively limited resolution in QTL localization, the association mapping or linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping approach can offer an alternative way for fine mapping of genes. Currently there are few LD methods available for QTL mapping in natural populations. Development of more efficient methods is still a challenging problem. In this thesis, we first review the LD approach for fine mapping of QTL in Chapter 1. Some basic issues in LD analysis and recent developments in LD methodology are discussed. Particular attention is paid to limitations and potential problems of these methods. This provides the motivation for the research in this thesis.Next, we explore Cockerham's genetic model (Cockerham, 1954) for quantitative traits in Chapter 2. A revised form of the Cockerham model is presented using some coding variables. The relationship between Cockerham model and some specific genetic models for designed experimental populations, such as backcross or F2, is then established. We study extensively the properties of QTL effects and partitions of various genetic variance components for these reduced models under both linkage equilibrium and linkage disequilibrium situations. A general multi-locus-two-allele model is also proposed that may serve as a basis for mapping QTL in natural populations. The main research of the thesis is on development of an exact multipoint likelihood approach to infer QTL in natural populations. In Chapter 3, we first generalize the formulation of the likelihood analysis for a polymorphic marker locus and a trait locus in a general natural population. From this generalization, we derive a closed form solutionof an efficient EM algorithm for the likelihood analysis. This is a major achievement of the research. The importance of this generalization is that it can be readily and systematically extended to multiple markers and multiple QTL.Based on this formulation, a multipoint likelihood analysis with the EM algorithm is developed that can take into account higher-order linkage disequilibria between QTL and markers without making approximation to the likelihood function. This analysis can offer a simultaneous estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure between a QTL and multiple markers. From this estimation, we find that the linkage disequilibrium between one or a subset of markers and a QTL conditional on other markers can offer as a more accurate measure for fine mapping of QTL. In Chapter 4, we further extend the analysis to multiple QTL and propose a general framework for likelihood analysis of multiple QTL and markers. With this approach, the joint gametic frequencies of QTL and markers (thus various measures of linkage disequilibria between QTL and markers) as well as various genetic effects of QTL (including epistasis) can be estimated simultaneously. This general approach has a lot of potential for a complete analysis of genetic architecture of quantitative traits in natural populations. Although the foundation of this general framework has been laid down, more studies are still needed on a number of issues, such as efficiency and reliability of the optimization algorithm, statistical tests for QTL identification, model selection of complex QTL, and more efficient approaches to analyze large data sets. In the last chapter (Chapter 5), we draw some general conclusions from the research. We discuss the advantages as well as limitations of the approach developed in this thesis and problems for further research.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-19</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011012-133341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Low-Power, High Performance MEMS-based Switch Fabric</field><field name="creator">Duewer, Bruce Eliot</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;DUEWER, BRUCE ELIOT. A Low-Power, High Performance MEMS-based Switch Fabric. (Under the direction of Paul D. Franzon.)An approach with the potential for building large low power high performance crossbar networks is presented. Thin film polysilicon MEMS devices are developed to provide crosspoints. These devices are vertically moving plates that serve as variable capacitors. Addressing of large arrays using 2n rather than n-squared lines despite no active circuitry on the MEMS chips is facilitated by bistable device operation. Derivations of equations for bistable device operation are presented. Low power operation is possible as the devices are electrostatically controlled and are stationary except during reconfiguration. Early devices are fabricated using the MUMPS process. The bistability and array addressability properties are demonstrated. The substrate effect on device operation is measured and modeled; methods for utilizing the substrate effect to tune device operation are presented. Later devices are fabricated using the SUMMiT process. Changes in the SUMMiT design rules to increase allowable vertical motion range are proposed and designs using them fabricated. S-parameter characteristics of devices in both `on' and `off' states are measured. Addition of metallization after chip fabrication and release is necessary to lower the resistance of interconnect. A self masking method for applying this metallization allowing for decreased resistance at line crossings is proposed. This method is tested using each of sputtering and evaporation as the deposition technique for a gold and adhesion layer stack. Effectiveness of the method with each technique is evaluated. Chips suitable for providing high voltage control for large MEMS arrays are fabricated in a 2um feature size CMOS process. Architectures suitable for building large crossbars employing variable capacitor arrays are discussed. Optimization of hybrid CMOS/MEMS Clos arrays on the basis of criteria other than minimization of crosspoints is discussed. Array sizings to provide 192*192 and 256*256 crossbars are presented, and software examples for sizing and controlling Clos networks are provided. Evaluation of the suitability of the MEMS devices developed for use as digital or broadband crosspoints is evaluated, and potential future directions are proposed. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011015-145122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanotribology of a Vapor Phase Lubricant: Quartz Crystal Microbalance Study of Tricresylphosphate (TCP) Uptake on Iron and Chrome</field><field name="creator">Abdelmaksoud, Mohamed Khairalla</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Abdelmaksoud, Mohamed Khairallah. Nanotribology of a Vapor Phase Lubricant: Quartz Crystal Microbalance Study of Tricresylphosphate (TCP) Uptake on Iron and Chrome. (Under the direction of Jacqueline Krim.)TCP is a high-temperature vapor-phase lubricant that is known for its demonstrated anti-wear properties in macroscopic systems. Although this lubricant has been the subject of much research for over 40 years, the atomic-scale details of its lubrication mechanisms are far from being satisfactorily understood. One common macroscopic observation is that TCP acts as a lubricant on iron, but not on chrome surfaces.In this study, we have evaporated iron and chrome films in UHV conditions onto Quartz Crystal Microbalances (QCM) and then monitored the uptake rates and nanoscale dynamics of TCP on these substrates at different temperatures. Using an in-situ Auger spectrometer, the samples' surface chemistries were investigated in parallel with uptake rates at the various temperatures. TCP uptake on oxide surfaces as well as oxygen uptake on TCP exposed surfaces was also investigated, shedding light on the TCP-oxygen interaction in the presence of iron and chrome substrates and the effect of temperature on such reactions.We have found that TCP is physisorbed on iron at room temperature. Below 2000C, two to four TCP monolayers are adsorbed, and slip times of 2 ns are observed. At temperatures of 2000C and above, TCP molecules break up and intermix with the iron substrate, and no slippage is in evidence. At high temperature, chrome behaves similarly. But at room temperature its behavior is quite distinct. Exposure of TCP-coated iron surfaces to oxygen results in the formation of a viscoelastic polymer film. Such a film is not observed to form on chrome surfaces. This may well account for the difference in the observed behavior at the microscopic scale.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011018-114208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE INCLUSION OF REFERENCE SEEDS IN GENERATED DIALOGUE</field><field name="creator">Garlick, Joanna Shannon</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;GARLICK, JOANNA SHANNON. The Inclusion of Reference Seeds in Generated Dialogue (Under the direction of Michael Young).&lt;P&gt;In the course of natural dialogue, humans are able to effectively use previous conversation. This is true for many types of dialogue, including instructional or task-related conversation. When human speakers effectively leverage past conversation for illustrative or comparative purposes, their hearers reap the benefits of increased dialogue coherency and are better able to assimilate knowledge. The practice of utilizing past utterances in current conversation is called referencing. It is believed that if computer agents could utilize referencing the way humans do, these agents would produce more natural-sounding and effective dialogue. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For this reason, the natural language community has conducted a fair amount of research into referencing. While most of the past and current research focuses on identifying opportunities to refer backward and how to do so, this research focuses on the novel concept of a reference seed. We introduce the term seed to refer to a piece of information opportunistically included in generated dialogue with the intent that it be referred back to in the future. We show how seeds and references can be implemented using discourse planning operators and identify some general rules for when to do so. We also discuss a test system implemented to showcase the potential of the concept and report the encouraging results of an informal user study we have conducted. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011018-120028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Estimators For Generalized Linear Measurement Error Models With Interaction Terms</field><field name="creator">Dagalp, Rukiye Esener</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The primary objectives of this research are to develop andstudy estimators for generalized linear measurement errormodels when the mean function contains error-free predictorsas well as predictors measured with error and interactions between error-free and error-prone predictors. Attention is restricted to generalized linear models in canonical form with independent additive Gaussian measurement error in the error-prone predictors.Estimators appropriate for the functional (Fuller, 1987, Ch.1) version of the measurement error model are derived and studied. The estimators are also appropriate in the structural version of the model and thus the methods developed in this research are functional in the sense of Carroll, Ruppert and Stefanski (1995, Ch. 6).The primary approach to the development of estimators in this research is the conditional-score method proposed byStefanski and Carroll (1987) and described by Carroll et al.(1995, Ch. 6). Sufficient statistics for the unobserved predictors are obtained and the conditional distribution of the observed data given these sufficient statistics is derived. The latter admits unbiased score functions that arefree of the nuisance parameters (the unobserved predictors) and are used to construct unbiased estimating equations for model parameters.Estimators for the parameters of the model of interest are also derived using the corrected approach proposed by Nakamura (1990) and Stefanski (1989). These are also functional estimators in the sense of Carroll et al. (1995, Ch. 6) that are less dependent on the exponential-family model assumptions and thus provide a benchmark against whichto compare the conditional-score estimators.Large-sample distribution approximations for both theconditional-score and corrected-score estimators are derivedand the performance of the estimators and the adequacy of the large-sample distribution theory are studied via Monte Carlo simulation.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011019-142524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of Transport Phenomena in the Presence of Interfaces: Forced Convection in Composite Porous/Fluid Domains, Solidification with a Mushy Region, and Meniscus Formation in Dip Coating Processing</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Ming</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTXIONG, MING. Investigation of Transport Phenomena in the Presence of Interfaces: Forced Convection in Composite Porous/Fluid Domains, Solidification with a Mushy Region, and Meniscus Formation in Dip Coating Processing (Under the direction of Andrey V. Kuznetsov)Transport phenomena play an important role in many practical applications. Every time a new technology is developed, analysis of transport processes is crucial for its success. Numerical and analytical investigations of transport processes in forced convection in composite porous/fluid domains, solidification of binary alloys, and meniscus formation in dip coating process are performed. These processes include mass, momentum, and energy transport across interfaces. For forced convection in composite porous/fluid domains, the validity of single-domain approach is investigated via comparisons between the numerical and exact solutions. An analytical solution for fluid flow described by the Brinkman-Forchheimer-Darcy equation is obtained by utilizing the boundary layer approximation. Solidification of binary alloys is studied by utilizing a porous medium approach for modeling transport processes in the mushy zone. A three-phase model is developed to predict microporosity formation during this process. Solute redistribution during this process is modeled by using the Scheil and lever rules to describe solute transport at the local scale. The investigations show that initial hydrogen concentration is an important factor affecting microporosity formation. Also, some effective ways of controlling microporosity formation are suggested based on these investigations. Another process studied in this dissertation is the dip coating with liquid carbon dioxide used as a solvent. This is a new deposition technique developed in recent years. A model accounting for evaporation during this process is obtained based on the classical free meniscus theory. Numerical results agree well with experimental data. These results show that the dry film thickness increases with the increase of evaporation rate and initial solute concentration.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-10-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011024-185941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A MONTE CARLO EM ALGORITHM FOR GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH FLEXIBLE RANDOMEFFECTS DISTRIBUTION</field><field name="creator">CHEN, JUNLIANG</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;CHEN, JUNLIANG. A Monte Carlo EM algorithm for generalized linear mixed modelswith flexible random effects distribution. (Under the direction of DaowenZhang and Marie Davidian)A popular way to model correlated binary, count, or other data arising inclinical trials and epidemiological studies of cancer and other diseases is byusing generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), which acknowledge correlationthrough incorporation of random effects. A standard model assumption is thatthe random effects follow a parametric family such as the normal distribution.However, this may be unrealistic or too restrictive to represent the data,raising concern over the validity of inferences both on fixed and randomeffects if it is violated.Here we use the seminonparametric (SNP) approach (Davidian and Gallant 1992,1993) to model the random effects, which relaxes the normality assumption andjust requires that the distribution of random effects belong to a class of``smooth'' densities given by Gallant and Nychka (1987). This representation allows the density of random effects to be very flexible, including densitiesthat are skewed, multi--modal, fat-- or thin--tailed relative to the normal, andthe normal as a special case. We also provide a reparameterization of thisrepresentation to avoid numerical instability in estimating the polynomialcoefficients.Because an efficient algorithm to sample from a SNP density is available, wepropose a Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm using arejection sampling scheme (Booth and Hobert, 1999) to estimate the fixedparameters of the linear predictor, variance components and the SNP density. Astrategy of choosing the degree of flexibility required for the SNP density isalso proposed. We illustrate the methods by application to two data sets fromthe Framingham and Six Cities Studies, and present simulations demonstratingperformance of the approach.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011025-112332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a digital protocol for vegetation mapping</field><field name="creator">Harrell, Melani Hix</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTHARRELL, MELANI HIX.

This study brings together computer stereo viewing with scanned aerial photos in a GIS to produce a fully digital protocol for mapping vegetation to the formation level. Erdas Imagine was used to generate digital images from aerial photos, Erdas Orthobase was applied to orthorectify the images through a joint triangulation solution for 42 photos, and Erdas StereoAnalyst provided on screen stereo viewing for vegetation delineation. Vegetation polygons were then classified using the National Vegetation Classification System formations in ArcView 3.2, and a thematic accuracy assessment was carried out on the vegetation map using the USGS-NPS standards. A positional accuracy assessment was conducted on the photo mosaic produced from the orthorectified images. Thematic accuracy was 77.55% initially, and the revised map had an 88.70% thematic accuracy. Positionally, the photo mosaic had Class 1 positional accuracy along the X-coordinate with 0.603 meters RMSE and had Class 2 accuracy along the Y-coordinate with 2.415 meters RMSE. A protocol using entirely digital methods was produced with the software cited that meets the formation level USGS-NPS vegetation mapping standards. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Natural Resources</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011029-183023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Routine techniques for monitoring the nutritional value of animal meals</field><field name="creator">Qiao, Yanrui</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Feed mills demand routine techniques to analyze digestible amino acids in highly variable animal meals. As routine tools, infrared spectroscopic predictions of digestible amino acids require reference samples assayed in vivo. Lack of reference samples resulting from costly and time-consuming in vivo assays has limited infrared spectroscopic applications. To remove this limitation, an in vitro assay mimicking in vivo digestion in swine was sought as a replacement to build the reference database.&lt;p&gt;Pepsin and pancreatic proteases used in the in vitro assays produce autolysates that are assayed as digestible amino acids. To correct this contamination and define incubation time for efficient use of the proteases, the autolysis of these proteases was studied. Correction of enzyme contamination with enzyme blank incubations and incubation time of 24 hours for pepsin and 96 hours for pancreatic proteases were proposed (Chapter III and IV).&lt;p&gt;In vitro digestion focused on maximal hydrolysis of peptide bonds with minimal enzyme usages for restriction of enzyme contamination. The minimal enzyme usage was determined to be 6.5% (enzyme to substrate ratio) (Chapter V).&lt;p&gt;Study on absorption of peptides in swine revealed that all soluble in vitro peptides could be estimated as digestible in vivo. Average in vitro digestibility coefficients were comparable to in vivo for a number of amino acids but mismatch occurred for individual samples. In vivo digestible amino acids, though, could be predicted with in vitro digestible amino acids. For example, lysine was predicted with an error of 0.27% (Chapter VI).&lt;p&gt;Total and digestible amino acids were predicted with near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) and mid infrared Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) but not with Raman spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopic prediction errors for digestible lysine were 0.27% for near infrared spectroscopy and 0.26% for mid infrared spectroscopy. Total amino acids seemed better predicted than digestible amino acids by infrared spectroscopy (Chapter VII). &lt;p&gt;The study showed that as routine techniques, infrared spectroscopy could potentially replace both in vivo and wet chemical analyses of amino acids.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011030-112347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF NANOCRYSTALLINE Zn</field><field name="creator">ZHANG, XINGHANG</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The goals of this thesis were to synthesize nanocrystalline Zn, to study the mechanical properties of bulk nanocrystalline Zn and try to reveal the deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline materials. Nanocrystalline Zn powder has been synthesized by a cryomilling method. The average grain size decreased exponentially with the cryomilling time and reached a minimum average grain size of around 17nm. Large numbers of small grains (2~6nm) have been found in the very early stages of cryomilling. Dynamic recrystallization (DRX) was used to explain the observed phenomena. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study the structural changes and grain size distribution with milling time and subsequent annealing. Maxima in both stored enthalpy (for the low temperature DSC peak) and lattice strain on the Zn basal planes were observed at the same milling time. Dislocation density on the basal planes is proposed as a major source for lattice strain and the measured stored enthalpy. The released enthalpy that might be due to grain growth is very small. These cryomilled nanocrystalline Zn powders were consolidated into disks with a density of nearly theoretical density by uniaxial compression at room temperature. Cyclic variation of microhardness with milling time has been observed in cryomilled nanocrystalline Zn. Evidence from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) suggests that the variation of dislocation density and grain size distributions determine the hardness behavior. A model, based on a kinetic reaction-rate model for cyclic amorphous-to-crystalline phase transformations observed during ball milling, simulates the experimental results very well. The model confirms the effect of DRX on modulated cyclic variation of microhardness. Dislocation strain hardening and recrystallization effects are superposed linearly with the intrinsic grain boundary hardening during the simulation. A dislocation density on the order of 10/sup 16/m /sup -2/ is predicted to be necessary to trigger DRX from the model. This prediction is evidenced by HRTEM observation of dislocation density on the same order and consistent with the estimation from thermodynamic calculation. The activation energy for rate controlling step in DRX estimated from the model is around 50 kJ/mol. This estimation indicates that a grain boundary diffusion controlled mechanism could dominate in DRX. Ductility of cryomilled nanocrystalline Zn has been studied by MDBT. The yield strength obtained from MDBT shows modulated cyclic variations with cryomilling time. Three times yield strength is consistent with the microhardness values for the same Zn samples. Ductility of CM2h and CM4h samples are much better than other cryomilled samples as indicated by a much larger ratio of normalized displacement than other cryomilled nanocrystalline Zn samples. However, the ductility of all cryomilled Zn samples is poor or very limited. The poor ductility of cryomilled Zn is presumably due to the remaining flaws as a result of incomplete bonding between particles. The Young?s modulus measured from MDBT barely changes for all tested samples. Bulk (spherical balls) ultra-fine-grained (UFG) or nanostructured Zn via in situ consolidation of powders are produced by mechanical attrition at room temperature. The size of these spherical balls increased with the increase of ball milling time. The grain size decreased rapidly to around 80nm after 1h of ball milling and then increased to around 240nm at 3h. The grain size decreased gradually thereafter with the increase of milling time. An average gain size of around 23nm was achieved for Zn bulk samples ball milled for 25h. In situ consolidation of metal powders during mechanical attrition may be a promising method to produce bulk UFG or nanostructured materials with full density and less contamination. The hardness, yield stress measured from MDBT, and tensile tests are consistent with one another. The hardness increased almost linearly with the decrease of grain size. The positive Hall-Petch slope is much smaller compared to the slope for coarse-grained Zn. Except for BM1h Zn sample, all other samples possess good ductility as evidenced from miniaturized disk bend test (MDBT) results and from the observations of fracture surfaces studied by FESEM. A bulged hat shape sample is usually obtained after MDBT test. The Young?s modulus almost keeps the same as for conventional coarse-grained Zn. The low temperature ball milling proves to be more efficient in reducing the grain size. A maximum elongation of around 110% is achieved for UFG Zn (around 240nm) under uniaxial tension test, which discloses a superplastic deformation in UFG Zn at room temperature. The elongation of room temperature ball milled Zn decreases with the decrease of grain size. Around 20% elongation is observed for Zn with an average grain size of around 23nm. Tension tests at elevated temperature result in a reduction of yield stress. The significant drop of yield stress at 200 centigrade degree or above may be due to recovery or recrystallization as evidenced from FESEM images. A strain rate sensitivity value of around 0.14 is usually found for Zn tested at 20 centigrade degree - 40 centigrade degree. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011030-161617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface reactions during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon and silicon based dielectrics</field><field name="creator">Gupta, Atul</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Theoretical ab-initio calculations (including both the Configuration Interaction and Density Functional approaches) are used to describe some of the critical surface reactions during plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of amorphous and micro-crystalline silicon films.

Another important reaction involving the insertion of these radicals (silyl and hydrogen) into strained Si-Si bonds on the surface is also evaluated. Experiments involve surface topology evolution studies of plasma deposited a-Si:H films using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as well as structural and electrical characterization of silicon dioxide films using several techniques including infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and current-voltage measurements. A predictive kinetic model to describe the growth of silicon films from a predominantly silyl radical flux is developed to explain experimental observations regarding the properties of plasma deposited amorphous silicon films.

The effect of mesoscale processeson the boundary layer structure also has significant implications in theunderstanding of circulation patterns and regional scale predictability. Largegeographical variability in North Carolina (NC) provides a wide variety ofweather events and climatological regimes.There are many challenges for numerical modeling in NC due to theheterogeneity in topography, land use, and soil type, presence of the oceanand the Gulf Stream. These heterogeneous attributes feature an excellentlocation for simulations and validation of the MM5 numerical modeling systemwith observations of high spatial and temporal resolution.MM5 is utilized for a non-precipitation case and a convective caseincluding precipitation with a 5-km domain centered over the Carolinas.Model integration is for 72 hours from 0000Z August 15, 2000 to 0000ZAugust 18, 2000. Simulated hourly surface and sub-surface values areevaluated against in-situ surface observations. These simulations consist ofreal case studies involving MM5 Version 3 with the MRF PBL schemecoupled to the Oregon State University (OSU) land surface model (LSM).The OSU LSM uses 1 km resolution land-use and soil data as input into MM5for capturing the dynamics of land-surface forcing.The acquisition and combination of different agro-meteorological dataacross NC provides high-resolution observations used for validation atmultiple model grid points. For the case studies, these data incorporate hourlyobservation sites throughout North Carolina including 19 ASOS (AutomatedSurface Observing Sites / owned and operated by the NWS and FAA) sitesand 15 ECONet (Environmental and Climate Observing Network: maintainedby State Climate Office of North Carolina) sites. Multiple parameterscompared and investigated using this network of observations include:ECONet: Air Temperature (2m), Relative Humidity (2m), Wind Speed (10m),Wind Direction (10m), Soil Temperature (10 cm), Soil Moisture (10cm), HourlyPrecipitation rate; ASOS: Air Temperature (2m), Dewpoint (2m), Wind Speed(10m), Wind Direction (10m), Hourly Precipitation, Weather Conditions, andCloud Layers.The approach involves examination of simulated horizontal and verticalwind patterns across the coast, piedmont, and mountainous regions in NorthCarolina. These simulated wind fields are used to investigate local land-seainteractions near the coast, effects of land surface processes in the piedmont,and pollution transport potential over complex terrain in the mountains of North Carolina. Precipitation patterns generated by the model are alsocompared with daily observations of precipitation amounts in conjunction withthe hourly stations across the central portion of the 5 km domain, particularlyNorth and South Carolina.Following a graphical comparison of 2D and 3D fields, statisticalmethods are applied to provide quantitative relationships for errors and biasesin the simulations. The analyses give additional insight into modelperformance. This is especially important when validating complex andcomprehensive interactions and processes that occur in North Carolina.Statistical measures used include: absolute correlation, root mean squareerror (RMSE), bias, normalized mean square error (NMSE), weightednormalized mean square error of the normalized ratios (WNNR), normalizedmean square error of the distribution of the normalized ratios (NNR), and theindex of agreement.Diurnal variation is handled well by the model indicating that thethermodynamic structure of the atmosphere is well simulated. Nocturnalboundary layer processes are poorly simulated, particularly in western NC,and heterogeneous surface features have significant effects on regional scaleprocesses including boundary layer structure and precipitation patterns.Model performance degrades over regions with complex terrain signifying thatmore observations are needed to develop regionally consistent flow patterns.Precipitation patterns are simulated with a fair amount of accuracy whenincluding the Kain-Fritsch cumulus parameterization scheme.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011031-181856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene modulation during peroxisome proliferator-induced hepatocarcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Steven P.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ANDERSON, STEVEN PAUL. Gene modulation in peroxisome proliferator-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. (Under the direction of Russell C. Cattley and John M. Cullen). Recognition that peroxisome proliferator chemicals are potent hepatic mitogens and carcinogens in rats and mice has generated concern about possible human health risks associated with exposure to several of these chemicals, many of which have medical or commercial utility. Our broad objective was to improve the estimation of human health risk following peroxisome proliferator exposure by defining a subset of the molecular events associated with the rodent tumors. Our working hypothesis was that peroxisome proliferator-induced tumors in rodents result from specific, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-a(Ppara)-modulated changes in gene expression. The research was directed toward three specific aims. First, we sought to identify genes associated with hepatocarcinogenesis induced by the peroxisome proliferator, Wy-14, 643, in the rat. The principle conclusion of these studies - that peroxisome proliferators dysregulate expression of hepatic acute-phase protein genes - suggested possible perturbations in cytokine signaling networks that also regulate cell growth. Second, although Ppara is necessary for the rodent hepatocarcinogenesis induced by peroxisome proliferators, we were interested in identifying more proximate mediators of the increased cell proliferation. Thus, we examined cytokine signaling in mice treated with peroxisome proliferators. We found that peroxisome proliferator-induced increases in cell proliferation is not mediated via Tnfa&#61472;signaling, but instead may be mediated through interleukin-1b or interleukin-6. Third, because Ppara is necessary for the cell proliferation that follows peroxisome proliferator exposure, we hypothesized that the receptor may play a role in hepatocellular proliferation induced by other stimuli. Following partial hepatectomy, liver regeneration in Ppara-null mice is transiently impaired, and may result from altered expression of genes regulating the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint in hepatocytes from these mice. Overall, our studies suggest that hepatic Ppara activation (1) alters inflammatory mediators, (2) modulates several potentially mitogenic cytokines, and (3) is necessary for normal liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Our data, compared with data from similar experiments on human hepatocytes, may provide further clues about the differences and similarities between peroxisome proliferator exposure in humans and laboratory animals.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Comparative Biomedical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011101-131940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalizations of the Multivariate Logistic Distribution with Applications to Monte Carlo Importance Sampling</field><field name="creator">Hudson-Curtis, Buffy L.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Monte Carlo importance sampling is a useful numerical integration technique, particularly in Bayesian analysis. A successful importance sampler will mimic the behavior of the posterior distribution, not only in the center, where most of the mass lies, but also in the tails (Geweke, 1989). Typically, the Hessian of the importance sampler is set equal to the Hessian of the posterior distribution evaluated at the mode. Since the importance sampling estimates are weighted averages, their accuracy is assessed by assuming a normal limiting distribution. However, if this scaling of the Hessian leads to a poor match in the tails of the posterior, this assumption may be false (Geweke, 1989). Additionally, in practice, two commonly used importance samplers, the Multivariate Normal Distribution and the Multivariate Student-t Distribution, do not perform well for a number of posterior distributions (Monahan, 2000). A generalization of the Multivariate Logistic Distribution (the Elliptical Multivariate Logistic Distribution) is described and its properties explored. This distribution outperforms the Multivariate Normal distribution and the Multivariate Student-t distribution as an importance sampler for several posterior distributions chosen from the literature. A modification of the scaling by Hessians of the importance sampler and the posterior distribution is explained. Employing this alternate relationship increases the number of posterior distributions for which the Multivariate Normal, the Multivariate Student-t, and the Elliptical Multivariate Logistic Distribution can serve as importance samplers. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011101-224634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETIC AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS OF PLANT NUCLEAR MATRIX PROTEINS</field><field name="creator">Phelan, Thomas Joseph</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;PHELAN, THOMAS JOSEPH, Genetic and Molecular Analysis of Plant Nuclear Matrix Proteins. (Under the direction of Steven L. Spiker.)The eukaryotic nucleus is composed of DNA, RNA and protein, encapsulated by a nuclear envelope. DNA is compacted up to ten thousand times in order to be packaged into the nucleus. The nucleus must maintain order in the presence of a very high density and variety of protein and RNA. The nuclear matrix is a proteinaceous network thought to provide structure and organization to the nucleus. We believe that relatively stable interactions of nuclear molecules with the nuclear matrix are key to organization of the nucleus. Numerous "Matrix Attachment Region" DNA elements (MARs), have been isolated from plants, animals, and fungi. Evidence suggests that these MARs attach to the nuclear matrix, delimiting loops of chromosomal DNA. In studies of transgenic plants and animals, MARs have been shown to give important advantages to organisms transformed with genes flanked by these elements. Unlike most DNA elements, no specific sequence elements have been identified in MAR DNAs. Partly due to the insolubility of the matrix, and to the heterogeneity of MAR DNA, very few of the protein components of the nuclear matrix have been identified. This work presents analysis the proteins of the plant nuclear matrix. We have characterized a set of related proteins from the model plant Arabidopsis that associate with MAR DNA in vitro. These proteins appear to be similar to the NOP56/NOP58 family of proteins previously identified in several eukaryotic organisms. The NOP56/NOP58 proteins are thought to be involved in modifications of ribosomal RNA. Binding studies presented in this work suggest that these plant proteins may participate in RNA/DNA/protein complexes in the nucleus.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011104-233111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Heat Pumps for Heating and Night Cooling of Greenhouses</field><field name="creator">Gurjer, Yeshwant Ramesh</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Gurjer, Yeshwant Ramesh. Use of Heat Pumps for Heating and Night Cooling of Greenhouses. (under the direction of Daniel H. Willits). The use of heat pumps for heating and night cooling of greenhouses was investigated using a computer simulation program and weather data from Typical Meteorological Year (TMY2) datasets for Raleigh, NC, and Wilmington, NC. A greenhouse computer model taken from the literature, along with the heat pump subroutines (HPHEAT and HPCOOL) developed in this study, were used for the simulations. The use of heat pumps for heating only, and for heating plus night cooling, were examined separately using both standard and time-of-use electricity rates for two North Carolina utility providers. When heat pumps were used only for heating, standard electricity rates were predicted to provide greater savings in utility costs compared to time-of-use rates. When heat pumps were used for both heating and night cooling, the predicted savings in utility costs was greater for time-of-use electricity rates. Night cooling was predicted to decrease the average daily temperature (0.10C to 1.10C) and average nighttime temperature (0.10C to 2.00C) inside the greenhouse providing the potential for increased yield. Although a heat pump of capacity 36.5 W/m2 of floor area provided less savings in total costs compared to a capacity of 76 W/m2, the heat pump with the smaller capacity (36.5 W/m2) may be a better proposition because of the lower purchase cost. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011105-182143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Termination Strategies in Sparse Interpolation Algorithms</field><field name="creator">Lee, Wen-shin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A black box polynomial is an object that takes as input a valuefor each variable and evaluates the polynomial at the given input.The process of determining the coefficients and terms of a blackbox polynomial is the problem of black box polynomialinterpolation. Two major approaches have been addressing suchpurpose: the dense algorithms whose computational complexities aresensitive to the degree of the target polynomial, and the sparsealgorithms that take advantage of the situation when the number ofnon-zero terms in a designate basis is small. In this dissertationwe cover power, Chebyshev, and Pochhammer term bases. However, asparse algorithm is less efficient when the target polynomial isdense, and both approaches require as input an upper bound oneither the degree or the number of non-zero terms. By introducingrandomization into existing algorithms, we demonstrate and developa probabilistic approach which we call "early termination." Inparticular we prove that with high probability of correctness theearly termination strategy makes different polynomialinterpolation algorithms "smart" by adapting to the degree or tothe number of non-zero terms during the process when either is notsupplied as an input. Based on the early termination strategy, wedescribe new efficient univariate algorithms that race a denseagainst a sparse interpolation algorithm in order to exploit thesuperiority of one of them. We apply these racing algorithms asthe univariate interpolation procedure needed in Zippel'smultivariate sparse interpolation method. We enhance the earlytermination approach with thresholds, and present insights toother such heuristic improvements.

These objects may be distributed across a number of different computers and across networks.This thesis presents a popular distributed object architecture, Remote Method Invocation (RMI). As RMI works on a Java framework, it provides the same features Java provides. Its portability, ability to transport objects as a whole, and power to connect to existing as well as legacy systems makes a strong choice amongst other competing technologies. Needless to say, the transport of objects across systems brings along with it the necessity for a strong security framework.The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a widely popular protocol that currently provides the secure framework RMI needs. Most e-commerce applications these days run over SSL. However, SSL may not the right choice for every application requiring a security backbone. The motivation behind this thesis lies in this thought. The Secure Remote Password Protocol (SRP) provides a secure, simple and fast approach for providing client authentication. An attempt has been made to build a new infrastructure using SRP. The infrastructure that has been developed can provide authentication and privacy, as well as maintain message integrity. One such application domain is mobile computing. In this era where data is required to be accessible from anywhere and everywhere, mobile computing is a growing area. Again, due to the use of mobile agents in this area, security plays an important role. The security mechanism provided needs to be fast and simple and at the same time provide strong security.

Beginning in the 1970?s, the United States EPA has established a number of regulations controlling current and future storage, transport, and disposal efforts and address the need to remediate existing contaminated sites. However, regulations provide only the desired goal, not a roadmap of how to accomplish remediation. It falls then, to individuals in research and industry, to devise techniques effective in reducing / eliminating contamination levels at sites of concern. Existing remediation techniques of pump and treat and air sparing / soil vapor extraction are effective, but often take many years to accomplish remediation to regulatory levels. Thermal treatments such as steam stripping and electrical heating of soils, are much less time consuming, but much more costly endeavors. Low temperature thermal desorption (at temperatures less than 80 degrees C) holds promise by incorporating the benefits of higher temperatures, such as the increase in vapor pressure and the decrease in viscosity, without the extreme cost usually associated with thermal treatments. In order to test this hypothesis, a research testing program focused on batch testing in the laboratory setting was developed to assess the viability of increased temperatures on the desorption efficiency of benzene on various soils. Testing consisted of three soils, a poorly graded Ottowa sand, kaolinite, and a natural silty sand soil from the Lockbourne Air Force Base experimental testing site. The contaminant of concern is benzene, a carcinogenic and mutagenic compound that is one of the four major components of BTEX, a constituent of most diesel fuels. Benzene was chosen because of its presence at the LAFB testing site at contamination levels 164 times groundwater regulation limit of 5 ppb. Laboratory testing was conducted at initial benzene solution concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 mg/L. Four temperatures; 20, 40, 60, and 80 degrees C, were used in the batch testing program. Results from testing support the theory that increased temperatures result in higher desorption efficiency. For lower concentrations of 10 and 100 ppm, temperatures as low as 40 degrees C correlated to increases in desorption levels from 40 percent (at 20 degrees C) to over 80 percent for the kaolinite and natural soil. Sand also experienced a doubling in desorption efficiency (from roughly 30 percent to roughly 70 percent) at the 60 degrees C temperature and 10 and 100 ppm concentrations. The 1000 ppm testing concentration resulted in more modest, but still increasing removal efficiencies at increased temperatures. Remediation at moderately increased temperatures appears to be a promising technique, but further research needs to be performed on soils that have experienced long term exposure to contamination to assess whether or not increased desorption efficiency trends are maintained. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011107-090112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution of Breeding Birds in Great Smoky Mountains National Park</field><field name="creator">Shriner, Susan Ann</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;We assessed the utility of developing predictive models of species distribution within a large contiguous forest based solely on GIS (Geographic Information Systems) data. We conducted more than 7000 point count surveys of breeding birds at approximately 4000 locations throughout Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP). We combined these empirical data with habitat, topographic, and location variables to develop logistic regression models for 20 breeding bird species. The mean of observed points correctly classified for evaluation data was 74.3% with a range of 67.4% to 83.1%. Mean improvement in model classification rates with the addition of a trend surface was 0.9% with a range of ?0.4% to 2.0%. We also assessed the importance of controlling for differences in species detectability in different vegetation types. Comparisons of models based on unlimited radius plot data with models based on fixed width plot data that minimized detectability differences between vegetation types showed classification rates dropped an average of 0.9% with a range of -3.8% to 3.7% for fixed width plots. In the eastern U.S., invasion of hemlock wooly adelgid (Homoptera: Adelgidae: Adelges tsugae) is transforming species composition of native forests by causing extensive mortality in eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) populations. We assessed the potential effects of hemlock loss in GSMNP by evaluating current hemlock distribution and abundance patterns and identifying environmental correlates of hemlock presence. We investigated potential effects of hemlock mortality on the park's avifauna by identifying bird species associated with hemlock. Our results indicate hemlock is widespread in all vegetation strata at low and mid elevations and is the second most common tree species in the park. Hemlock presence is significantly associated with elevation, total relative moisture index, disturbance history, vegetation type, and bedrock geology. Sixteen of 30 common breeding bird species showed significant correlations with hemlock presence. Hemlock loss will favor increased abundance of avian species associated with early successional and disturbed habitats and reduced abundance of avian species associated with late successional forests.We compared breeding bird community structure and composition in old growth and mature second growth (65-100 years old) forests in the southern Appalachians using paired point count. We found few differences in the two communities. Comparisons of relative abundance based on counts of individual bird species showed two species were significantly more abundant on old growth sites and one species was significantly more abundant on second growth sites. After incorporating differential detectability into relative abundance estimates, we found that 4 breeding bird species were significantly more abundant in old growth sites compared to second growth sites and that no breeding bird species was significantly more abundant in second growth sites. These results highlight the importance of incorporating detectability measures into sampling and analytic methods. Analysis of vegetation samples for the paired sites showed significant differences between old growth and second growth sites. Old growth sites had significantly more large trees for classes &gt; 50 cm diameter at breast height. Vegetation composition comparisons showed old growth sites had significantly more late successional species and significantly fewer species associated with early successional forests. Nonetheless, measures of species richness, relative abundance, and number of standing snags did not differ between old growth and second growth sites. Breeding bird composition similarities between old growth and second growth sites in this study may not be typical of more fragmented landscapes because large remaining patches of old growth forest adjacent to second growth sites may ameliorate differences between the &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011107-134136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Distributed Parameter Liver Model of Benzene Transport and Metabolism in Humans and Mice - Developmental, Theoretical, and Numerical Considerations</field><field name="creator">Gray, Scott Thomas</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; GRAY, SCOTT THOMAS. A Distributed ParameterLiver Model of Benzene Transport and Metabolism in Humans and Mice -Developmental, Theoretical, and Numerical Considerations. (Under thedirection of Hien T. Tran.) &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Clean Air Act of 1970, the U. S. Congress names benzene ahazardous air pollutant and directs certain government agencies toregulate public exposure. Court battles over subsequent regulations haveled to the need for quantitative risk assessment techniques. Models forhuman exposure to various chemicals exist, but most current modelsassume the liver is well-mixed. This assumption does not recognize (mostsignificantly) the spatial distribution of enzymes involved in benzenemetabolism. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development of a distributed parameter liver model that accountsfor benzene transport and metabolism is presented. The mathematicalmodel consists of a parabolic system of nonlinear partial differentialequations and enables the modeling of convection, diffusion, andreaction within the liver. Unlike the commonly used well-mixed model,this distributed parameter model has the capacity to accommodate spatialvariations in enzyme distribution. &lt;/p&gt;The system of partial differential equations is formulated in a weak orvariational setting that provides natural means for the mathematical andnumerical analysis. In particular, general well-posedness results ofBanks and Musante for a class of abstract nonlinear parabolic systemsare applied to establish well-posedness for the benzene distributedliver model. Banks and Musante also presented theoretical results for ageneral least squares parameter estimation problem. They included aconvergence result for the Galerkin approximation scheme used in ournumerical simulations as a special case. &lt;p&gt;Preliminary investigations on the qualitative behavior of thedistributed liver model have included simulations with orthograde andretrograde bloodflow through mouse liver tissue.

The studies were carried out on both southern hardwood and southern softwood species. It was found that the extractives affected the bleachability of pulps by reaction and blocking mechanisms. For hardwood pulps, the reaction of extractives with bleaching chemicals was more significant. For softwood, the blocking effect of extractives was more pronounced. During the batch extended delignification process, the extractives were accumulated and precipitated on the pulps due to the black liquor recycling. The amount of precipitates was determined by the pretreatment conditions. It was possible to lower the extractive content of both the softwood and hardwood pulps by introducing a gas-off process in the pretreatment stage of a batch extended delignification process. The removal efficiency of extractives was affected by the gas-off process and the extractive distribution. The amount of extractives that was removed by the gas-off process was affected by the pretreatment operational conditions and the volatility of the extractives. The distribution of the extractives in the digester was also affected by the operational conditions. For the softwood, the natural extractives were comparatively volatile. It was possible to perform the gas-off under a high temperature and a high pH of the system. For the hardwood, the natural extractives were not volatile. High temperature and high pH were the ideal gas-off conditions. Apart from the extractive content, the fiber morphology also affected the bleachability of kraft pulps. For the softwood, the earlywood was easier to cook than the latewood. With the same kappa number, the final brightness of the earlywood pulp was at least 2% ISO higher than the latewood pulp because of the thinner fiber wall and faster leaching rate. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wood and Paper Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011109-094854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Assessment of New Weed Management Technologies in Strip- and Conventional-Tillage Cotton and Peanut and Common Ragweed Interference in Peanut.</field><field name="creator">Clewis, Scott Barton</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Low commodity prices and environmental concerns have compelled cotton growers to increase production efficiency while decreasing inputs. Research evaluated weed interference, strip-tillage production, transgenic cultivars, and new herbicides to improve weed management in peanut and cotton. The rectangular hyperbola model described the effect of common ragweed density on percent peanut yield loss. With the asymptote constrained to 100% maximum yield loss, the I coefficient (yield loss per unit density as density approaches zero) was 68.3 + 12.2%. Common ragweed height was not affected by weed density or peanut canopy diameter. Weed height exceeded peanut height throughout the growing season, indicating that competition for light occurred between the two species. Common ragweed above-ground dry biomass per plant decreased as weed density increased, but total weed dry biomass per m crop row increased with weed density. Studies evaluated weed management using diclosulam and flumioxazin in strip-tillage and conventional-tillage peanut. Dimethenamid plus diclosulam or flumioxazin preemergence (PRE) controlled common lambsquarters, eclipta, and prickly sida at least 91%. Diclosulam and flumioxazin controlled Ipomoea morningglory species (59 to 91%) and bentazon plus acifluorfen postemergence (POST) provided &gt;90% control. Dimethenamid plus diclosulam or flumioxazin PRE produced equivalent yields and net returns with no significant differences between the two PRE options. The tillage production system did not influence weed control of eight weeds, peanut yields, or net returns. Studies were conducted to evaluate weed management systems in non-transgenic, transgenic bromoxynil-resistant, and transgenic glyphosate-resistant cotton in strip- and conventional-tillage environments. Tillage did not affect the level of weed control provided by the herbicide systems evaluated. Excellent (&gt;90%) control of common lambsquarters, Ipomoea species including entireleaf, ivyleaf, pitted, and tall morningglories; jimsonweed, prickly sida, and velvetleaf was achieved with programs containing bromoxynil, glyphosate, and pyrithiobac early postemergence (EPOST). Glyphosate systems controlled fall panicum, goosegrass, and large crabgrass more consistently than bromoxynil and pyrithiobac systems. Bromoxynil and pyrithiobac EPOST did not control sicklepod unless applied in mixture with MSMA and followed by (fb) a late postemergence-directed (LAYBY) treatment of prometryn plus MSMA. Herbicide systems that included glyphosate EPOST controlled sicklepod with or without a soil-applied herbicide treatment. The highest yielding systems included all the glyphosate systems and bromoxynil systems that included a soil-applied herbicide treatment. Non-transgenic systems that included a soil-applied herbicide treatment yielded less than soil-applied treatment plus glyphosate EPOST system. Net returns from glyphosate systems were generally higher than net returns from bromoxynil or pyrithiobac systems.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011112-094020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manufacture and Field Test of a New Adaptive Shading Technology: A Case Study.</field><field name="creator">Gallion, Franklin Cordell</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;AbstractGALLION, FRANKLIN CORDELL. Manufacture and Field Test of a New AdaptiveShading Technology: A Case Study. (Under the direct on of Dr. Larry M.

The manufacturing team evaluatedevery aspect of the design implementation from component manufacture through fieldtesting. This evaluation was intended to guide future evolutions of the technology byanswering the most basic question: ?What has the Talley Student Center experiencetaught us about the technology and its future??A set of eight powerblind units, each measuring approximately three feet by fivefeet, were manufactured and installed in the Talley Student Center Boardroom. Workbegan with an existing design template. Component manufacture was performed duringthe fall semester of 2000. Manufacturing system development, troubleshooting, and unitassembly were completed during the first half of the 2001 spring semester. Installation,final troubleshooting, final delivery to the customer, and a public unveiling werecompleted in the second half of the 2001 spring semester.It was concluded that the technology works in a real-world setting. Althoughsome quality problems existed in the final delivered product, the reason in each case waswell understood, and potential avenues for solutions presented. It was also concluded thatthe product could be mass-produced to sufficient quality using relatively low-technologytools and techniques.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011112-184730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ANTHRACNOSE FRUIT ROT RESISTANCE IN STRAWBERRY</field><field name="creator">SHUMAN, JOEL LEE</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research has been to determine the nature of strawberry fruit resistance to anthracnose fruit rot. Production in the United States and North Carolina is heavily dependent upon two cultivars, Chandler and Camarosa. Both cultivars are susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), caused by the imperfect fungus . Results from this research will be used to further our understanding of the strawberry- system and to control AFR through breeding strategies or cultural practices. Components of resistance in strawberry to AFR were studied under field and controlled environment conditions; five strawberry genotypes were inoculated with conidia of under field conditions and seven genotypes were inoculated with either five inoculum concentrations or three isolates of in growth chambers. Strawberry genotypes responded differently to in the field and in a controlled environment. Components of resistance to AFR included rate-limiting resistance, reduced percent lesion, reduced probability of lesion formation due to fruit age and genotype, and plant canopy architecture. Rates of disease progress were different among genotypes, inoculum concentrations, isolates, and the genotype x isolate interaction. Susceptible genotypes and virulent isolates had faster rates of disease progress. Differences were observed among genotypes for yield, percent by weight, and number of berries with AFR. Plant canopy architecture influenced the hours of fruit wetness and the yield of berries with AFR; a loose open canopy had fewer hours. Young and old fruit were less susceptible to AFR than fruit of median age.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011113-210925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELECTED PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES IN CONJOINT BEHAVIORAL CONSULTATION</field><field name="creator">Grissom, Priscilla Fletcher</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Conjoint behavioral consultation, an extension of traditional behavioral consultation, is a relatively new model of structured problem-solving. No published study exists that systematically examines the relationship between process and outcome variables in CBC. In an effort to expand on the process-outcome research in traditional behavioral consultation, a relational communication perspective was adopted to examine the presence of relational control in CBC and its relationship to outcomes. CBC was initiated for 20 clients who were elementary and middle school students identified as having a disability such as behavioral or learning disorders. Consultants were 16 advanced graduate students trained in CBC, and consultees were 23 school-based professionals and 20 parents. Consultant, teacher, and parent control was measured within the Conjoint Problem Identification Interview of each case using the Family Relational Communication Control Coding System (Heatherington &amp; Friedlander, 1987). This coding system, an extension of the Rogers and Farace (1975) Relational Coding System, allows for patterns of relational control regarding the process of consultation to be examined. For each speaker, two measures of relational control were calculated, domineeringness and dominance. Domineeringness is the number of one-up messages by speaker A divided by the total number of messages for speaker A. Dominance is the number of one-up messages by speaker A responded to with one-down messages by speaker B. Outcomes were assessed at the conclusion of CBC regarding the acceptability of CBC, consultant effectiveness, and client improvement. Correlational results suggest that parent control (i.e., dominance) toward the consultant is associated with less favorable teacher ratings regarding model acceptability, r(19) = -49, p = .01, and less favorable parent ratings of client improvement, r(14) = -61, p = .01. Additionally, parent-to-teacher control was associated with less favorable parent ratings of client improvement, r(14) = -58, p = .01. In contrast to behavioral consultation's focus on teacher behavior, the results of this study suggest that greater importance should be paid to parent relational control with respect to outcomes of CBC.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011114-165614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying Innovativeness Among Users of Wireless Features and Services.</field><field name="creator">Santoro, Jon M</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Research and case studies have emphasized the role Early Adopters play (as gatekeepers and disseminators) in the diffusion of new technologies and innovations (Rogers &amp; Cartano, 1962; Robertson, 1971; Rogers, 1983; Flynn &amp; Goldsmith 1993). Marketers have acknowledge the need to identify, profile, utilize and potentially influence Early Adopters to successfully launch a new product or service (Robinson, 1988). This research assists with identifying the salient characteristics of Early Adopters (those with a high predisposition towards innovativeness) of wireless phone features and services. The findings provide a framework for future identification of Early Adopters within the wireless market, as well as, contributing to the study of Early Adopters in general.The research utilized a random sample of 3,045 wireless phone users within an eleven state calling area. Each user completed a detailed survey regarding telecommunication needs, usage and attitudes. Basic demographics, psychographics and lifestyle measures were also collected from each user.An adapted cross-sectional measure of innovativeness (Midgely &amp; Dowling 1978) based on prior wireless phone features and services adoption behavior, was used to identify a predisposition towards innovativeness, with regard to wireless features and services. Past research has identified the cross-sectional innovativeness measure as viable surrogate of adoption behavior (Stanton, 1999). A strong relationship was observed between traditional time-of-adoption measures and the cross-sectional innovativeness measures, within this analysis.The cross-sectional innovativeness measure was utilized as the dependent measure for the analysis. Two dependent variables were constructed from the cross-sectional innovativeness measure. The first dependent variable was a continuous variable, employing the cross-sectional innovativeness measure as a ratio scale variable. The variable provided a distribution from 0 (low innovativeness) to 20 (high innovativeness). The second dependent variable was a categorical variable that divided the cross-sectional innovativeness measure into to three distinct categories of adoption, similar to the adoption categories identified by Rogers (1983) in his definitive book Diffusion of Innovations. Similarly, the categories were labeled as Early Adopters, Middle Majority and Later Adopters.Three sets of independent variables were developed, based on past research findings concerning Early Adopters of the technology market and available measures found in the study questionnaire. The first set of independent variables, Demographics (Model 1), included the following predictor variables: age, marital status, education, household income, children in the household and home ownership. The second set of independent variables, Psychographics (Model 2), included self-perceived attitudes towards opinion leadership and risk taking/venturesomeness. The third set of independent variables combined both of the Demographics and Psychographics variables into one comprehensive set.In general the results of the study support many of the hypothesis posed. Few exceptions were noted. Early Adopters of the wireless market tended to be younger, more likely to be single, college educated, with higher household incomes, with fewer children, less likely to be owners of their primary residence, more likely to perceive themselves as opinion leaders, as well as having positive attitudes towards risk taking/venturesomeness. Analysis of the independent models, utilizing regression coefficients and uniqueness indices for the continuous dependent variable, and the proportional chance criteria and Press?s Q for the categorical dependent variable, pointed to the Demographics and Psychographics (Model 3) as the strongest model (followed by the Demographics (Model 1)). Age and income variables (followed by Opinion Leadership) provided the greatest contribution to the explanatory power of the independent models.The findings aid with present and future diffusion of wireless technologies, including wireless e-mail, wireless internet access and M-commerce, as well as other categories such as telecom and the technology market in general. The analysis marks the first step in a process of identifying, profiling, utilizing and potentially influencing Early Adopters of the wireless technology market.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011115-120920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abrasion Characteristics of Ring-Spun and Open-End Yarns</field><field name="creator">Jones, Jeremy</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; Jones, Jeremy. Abrasion Characteristics of Ring-Spun and Open-End Yarns. (Under the direction of Dr. Pam Banks-Lee and Dr. William Oxenham.) In the early 1980s, widespread claims in the knitting industry suggesting that the use of open-end yarns significantly increased the wear of mechanical components, especially knitting needles. Since then, many studies have attempted to explain this phenomenon and have yielded widely varying results. A study was conducted to compare the yarn properties of open-end yarn to ring-spun yarn. Identical yarns of varying parameters including yarn type, yarn count, and twist multiple were produced from the same raw cotton stock to eliminate variability in raw material. These yarns were tested for abrasiveness on a Lawson-Hemphill CTT (Continuous Tension Transport) tester. The device passes the yarn over a wire and records the length of yarn required to sever the wire. For this study the CTT was encoded to abrade a fixed length of yarn over the wire. The wire was then observed with both a Hitcahi ESEM (Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope) and a digital imaging microscope. The resultant images were examined for attrition and the abrasion values were evaluated using statistical analysis. It was confirmed that an increase in yarn count corresponded to a decrease in abrasion. Twist multiple had a noticeable effect on abrasion although the trends between yarn types, and yarn counts were inconsistent. Open-end yarn abrasion values were only slightly greater than their ring-spun counterparts, contradicting the claims of the knitting industry.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Textile Management and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011115-182006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SELECTIVE FISHING PRESSURE ON LARGE MALE BLUE CRABS NEGATIVELY AFFECTSMALE SIZE, SEX RATIO, AND POPULATION REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIALIN THE UPPER CHESAPEAKE BAY.</field><field name="creator">Carver, Adina Motz</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A male-focused size-selective fishing pressure has the potential to reduce the average size of the males in the population, reduce the density of males in the population, and/or raise the sex ratio of females to males. All of these may affect the mating dynamics of the population by reducing the amount of sperm that males provide to females and decreasing the number of males available for copulation. I used three different approaches to investigate the effect of the fishery on the population. First I collected paired and unpaired crabs from the field to investigate crab size and seminal stores in nature. This approach substantiated that male blue crabs subjected to heavier fishing pressure are smaller, and that smaller males pass less sperm and accessory fluid to females. It also demonstrated that although the most depleted males in the population are not mating, some that continue to form pre-copulatory pairs are as sperm depleted as males that had just completed copulation.My second approach involved the use of biotelemetry to monitor mating behaviors in the field. Tracked males demonstrated a proportionately greater amount of pairing behavior than tracked prepubertal females, which is consistent with expectations of crab behavior in a population with a female-biased Operational Sex Ratio. My third approach was to examine a long-term trawl data set for trends over time. A decline in the average size of mature males (carapace width &gt;110 mm) and an increase in the operational sex ratio of pre-pubertal females to mature males (carapace width &gt;110 mm) and pre-pubertal females to legally fished males (carapace width &gt;127 mm) were found at one of the four trawl locations. The observed trends in size and sex ratio at that trawl location are as would be expected in a population where an increasingly intense fishery has been removing large males. Analysis of seminal stores in conjunction with the crab behaviors and population trends provides evidence that the fishery is in fact having a detrimental affect on the reproductive potential of the blue crab populatio&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011116-104952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sliding Mode Observation and Control for Semiactive Vehicle Suspensions</field><field name="creator">Dixit, Ravindra</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Dixit, Ravindra Krishna.

The vehicle suspension models include realistic nonlinearities in thespring and magnetorheological (MR) damper elements, and the nonlinear reference models incorpo-rateskyhook damping. Since full state measurement is difficult to achieve in practice, a sliding modeobserver (SMO) that requires only suspension deflection as a measured input is developed. The per-formanceand robustness of sliding mode control (SMC), SMO, and SMOC is demonstrated throughcomprehensive computer simulations and compared to popular alternatives. The results of thesesimulations reveal the benefits of sliding mode observation and control for improved ride quality,and should be directly transferable to commercial semiactive vehicle suspension implementations.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011116-144808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerization of Vinylidene Fluoride in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide: Molecualr Weight Distribution</field><field name="creator">Saraf, Manish Kumar</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;SARAF, Manish Kumar. Polymerization of Vinylidene Fluoride in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide: Molecular Weight Distribution (Under the direction of Drs. George W. Roberts and Joseph M. DeSimone)Conventional vinylidene fluoride polymerizations require the use of large amounts of water. Therefore, energy and cost-intensive drying and separation steps are required to isolate the polymer. Additionally, some conventional polymerizations use fluorosurfactants that belong to 3M?s ?Scotchgard? family of surfactants, which are being phased out due to environmental concerns. In this research, we investigate a "green" process for the continuous polymerization of vinylidene fluoride by free-radical precipitation polymerization in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2). Significant technological and environmental improvements can be achieved by this technology, such as: 1) elimination of waste streams generated by conventional suspension, and emulsion processes; and 2) achievement of major energy savings, as the polymer is isolated in a dry form with no water or solvent to evaporate. The experimental system used in this research consisted of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for polymerization, and a polymer withdrawal system where polymer was collected, and continuously ejected to ambient conditions. The polymer was collected as a dry "free-flowing" powder, and was characterized by GPC (gel permeation chromatography), DSC (differential scanning calorimetry), and Fluorine-19 NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Experiments were carried out to study the effect of different parameters such as inlet monomer concentration ([M]in= 0.78 to 3.5 M), pressure (P=3050 to 4400 psig) , temperature (T=65 to 85 oC) , and average residence time (t = 12 to 50 mins.), on the polymerization rate and the average molecular weights. A homogeneous model based on classical free radical kinetics predicted the polymerization rate very well at the lower rates. However, this could not predict an inhibition in the rate that was observed at higher monomer concentrations. A bimodal molecular weight distribution was obtained at inlet monomer concentrations greater than around 1.9 M. The second (high molecular weight) mode was more prominent at higher monomer concentrations, higher residence times, and lower temperatures. Two hypothesis, poor mixing and long chain branching, were investigated to explain these broad and bimodal molecular weight distributions (MWDs). Agitation studies showed that poor mixing can account for the slower rate of polymerization at high monomer concentrations, but does not to bimodal MWDs. End group analysis using NMR showed that chain transfer occurs, probably to polymer. A homogeneous kinetic model was developed to investigate the effect of chain branching arising from chain transfer to polymer. This model showed that broad MWDs with large polydispersity indices (PDIs) are obtained at high monomer concentrations and at high residence times. These predictions matched very well with experimental data. However, the model predicted a unimodal MWD even at very high values of the rate constant for chain transfer to polymer.Batch polymerization studies were carried out to develop alternate low temperature initiators, which could reduce operating and equipment costs and potentially produce high molecular weight polymer with reasonable yields. A fluorinated initiator obtained from hexafluoropropynl oxide dimer produced PVDF with very high molecular weights (~90 K) at reasonable yields. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011119-185032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Power Spatial Combiners: Tile and Tray Approaches</field><field name="creator">Ortiz, Sean C.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Spatial power combining is a method of coherently combining the power of manyamplifying devices using free space as the power dividing/combining medium in contrastto traditional circuit based combiners. The spatial combiner is formed from anarray of amplifying unit cells, with each cell receiving a signal, amplifying it, and thenradiating it into free space. Two methods of spatial powercombining, tile and tray, are investigated in this thesis.The tile-based spatial combiner consists of a thick groundplane with receiving microstrip patch antennason one side and transmitting microstrip patch antennas on the other. In addition, amplifiers are placedon both sides of the thick groundplane, which provides efficient heat removal.This research is focused on the optimal array spacing, biasing,and feeding of tile-based arrays to achieve high output power levels atKa-band (Lockheed Martin was specifically interested in achieving greater than 25 Watts ofradiated power under a DARPA MAFET-3 program). Several arrays were developed, consisting of13, 45, and 98 elements. Noteworthy results were obtained from theexperiments with this design approach. A tray-based approach is also investigated in this thesis. This approach differsfrom the tile-based approach by having multiple groundplanes (trays) containingamplifiers stacked to form an array of amplifying unit cells. In addition,microstrip patch antennas are placed at the ends of the trays and radiate in an end-fire pattern with respectto the tray containing the amplifiers. For this purpose, an approach has been developedfor the feeding of the microstrip patch antennas. This feeding mechanismallows the amplifiers and radiating elements to be isolated. Thus moreroom is allowed for the amplifiers, while minimizing coupling that may causespurious oscillations. An X-band and Ka-band array have been developed,consisting of 25 and 49 elements, respectively. Both arrays provide efficientheat sinking through thick metal groundplanes. In addition, an experimentalanalysis on the array tolerance to device failure has been performed on both tray-basedarrays. This study examines the effect of device failure on the gain, power output, and radiationpattern.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-20</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011119-214207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen availability of anaerobic swine lagoon sludge: Sludge source and temperature effects.</field><field name="creator">Moore, Amber Dawn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Increased numbers of swine producers in North Carolina will be removing sludge from their lagoons in the next few years, mainly due to an increase in lagoons exceeding sludge capacity. Information on availability of nitrogen (N) in the sludge is needed to make improved recommendations about its use as a nutrient source for crops. The objectives of this study were to investigate possible affects related to lagoon sludges from different companies and operation types and to evaluate effects of seasonal temperatures and various application dates on the availability of N in lagoon sludge. Two separate incubation studies and one greenhouse study were conducted to quantify the N availability of the sludge. Sludges were mixed with a Wagram soil (loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Kandiudult) and incubated for one year at fluctuating seasonal temperatures based on four application dates (Feb. 26, June 4, Sept. 3, and Dec. 3). A second incubation experiment was conducted using sludges from three different company and operation-types. Samples were analyzed monthly for nitrate and ammonium. These sludges were also applied as the primary N source for bermuda grass, which was grown in the greenhouse, harvested and analyzed for total N. Operation effects were not detected in the incubation and greenhouse experiments. Company effects were detected in the incubation experiments yet considered to be negligible because differences were only significant (p &lt; 0.05) at weeks 0, 2, 3, and 8. A quadratic plateau curve fit to N mineralization data for all sludge sources (r^2 = 0.52) demonstrated that most of the active organic N was mineralized after 8 weeks of incubation. Nitrogen availability for all sludges averaged 45 percent after 8 weeks for the incubation study, but only 20 percent for the 14-week greenhouse study. This may have been related to inconsistent moisture throughout the soil in pots. In the incubators with fluctuating temperatures, NH4 remained in the soil for 4 months in the simulated winter application and for only 1 month for the simulated fall and summer applications, illustrating a direct influence of temperature changes on nitrification. Sludge N availability was fit to a nonlinear regression model for a first order reaction as follows: Nt = No (1 - e^(-kt)) + Nos where: Nt = total inorganic N concentration, over time (mg N/kg); No = potentially available organic N (mg N/kg); k = first order rate constant (month^-1); t = time (month); and Nos = inorganic N concentration when time = 0. Rate constants (k) increased between simulated applications as follows: fall (0.07) &lt; winter (0.075) &lt; spring (0.22) &lt; summer (0.36). Sludge applied during simulated winter temperatures released N at a relatively constant rate, as compared to simulated summer temperatures, which increased rapidly during the first 6 months, then stabilized to allow minimal increase of mineralized N for the remainder of the incubation.Predicted N availability for all temperature treatments after one year of incubation averaged 74 percent of the total N applied, supporting agronomic recommendations of 60 percent first-year plant-available N for incorporated swine lagoon sludge (NCCES, 1997). Year-long coefficients are unable to provide N availability information for short time length for growing seasons. To account for this, N availability for each month after sludge application was estimated using the first order equations for each simulated application date. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011119-215624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Falling Weight Deflectometer Multi-Load Level Data for Pavement Strength Estimation.</field><field name="creator">Park, Hee Mun</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;PARK, HEE MUN. Use of Falling Weight Deflectometer Multi-Load Level Data for Pavement Strength Estimation. (Under the direction of Y. Richard, Kim).The objective of this study is to describe a mechanistic-empirical approach to developing an analysis method for assessing pavement layer conditions and estimating the remaining life of flexible pavements using multi-load level Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) deflections. A dynamic finite element program, incorporating a stress-dependent soil model, was developed to generate the synthetic deflection database. Based on this synthetic database, the relationships between surface deflections and critical pavement responses, such as stresses and strains in each individual layer, have been established.A condition assessment procedure for pavement layers using multi-load level FWD deflections is presented in this study. The results indicate that the proposed procedure can estimate the base and subgrade layer conditions. However, large variations were observed in the relationships between the DBCI and desg values and the subgrade CBR values for aggregate base pavements. A FWD test with a load of 53 kN or less does not result in any apparent nonlinear behavior of the subgrade in aggregate base pavements. With regard to the condition assessment of the asphalt concrete (AC) layer, the AC layer modulus and the tensile strain at the bottom of the AC layer are found to be better indicators than the deflection basin parameter.The procedures for performance prediction of fatigue cracking and rutting are developed for flexible pavements. The drastically increasing trend in fatigue cracking with time may not be predicted accurately using the proposed procedure. Such trends may be due to the environmental effects and the inconsistent distress measurements. Predicted rut depths using both single and multi-load level deflections show good agreement with measured rut depths over a wide range of rutting potential. However, the procedure using single load level deflections consistently underpredicts the rut depths. This observation demonstrates that the rutting prediction procedure using multi-load level deflections can estimate an excessive level of rutting quite well and, thus, improve the quality of prediction for rutting potential in flexible pavements. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011120-151143</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Steam Generator Liquid Mass as a Control Input for the Movement of the Feed Control Valve in a Pressurized Water Reactor</field><field name="creator">Sakabe, Akira</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; The steam generator in a nuclear power plant plays an important role in cooling the reactor and producing steam for the turbine-generators. As a result, control of the water inventory in the steam generator is crucial. The water mass in the steam generator cannot be measured directly, so the water mass is generally inferred from the downcomer differential pressure as a measure of the downcomer water level. The water level in the downcomer is a good indication of the water mass inventory at or near steady-state conditions. Conventional PI controllers are used to maintain the water level in the downcomer between relatively narrow limits to prevent excessive moisture carryover into the turbine or the uncovering of the tube bundle. Complications arise in level control with respect to mass inventory due to the short-term inverse response of downcomer level. This is also known as shrink and swell. Due to the complications that arise from level control, one would like to directly control the mass inventory in the steam generator. Currently, the mass inventory is not a measurable quantity, but through the use of computer simulation can be calculated. Design and analysis of the new controller will be performed by simulation. The focus of this research was to develop and design, test, and implement a liquid mass inventory controller that would allow for safe automatic operation during normal and accident scenarios. In designing the new controller, it is assumed that the normal plant safety functions are not impacted by the mass controller. Optimal settings for the new mass controller are sought such that the mass control program will have rapid response and avoid reactor trips under automatic control if the downcomer level protection setpoints do not induce a trip for the same transient.For future analysis, it is proposed that neural networks be used in water mass observer instead of calculated simulation results. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-26</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011121-172405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rare vascular flora of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem: temporal responses to fire frequency and population size.</field><field name="creator">Gray, Janet Bracey</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;GRAY, JANET BRACEY. Rare vascular flora of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem: temporal responses to fire frequency and population size. (Under the direction of Dr. Thomas R. Wentworth) We examined factors likely to be important in the management of rare flora occurring in the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem on Fort Bragg and Camp Mackall Military Reservations in North Carolina. Thirty-six rare plant species, comprising 1,268 records, were documented during the course of two inventories of rare flora conducted during the periods 1991-93 and 1998-99. There were 891 (70.3%) records of persistence, 258 (20.3%) records of extinction, and 119 (9.4%) records of colonization; extinctions exceeded colonizations by 139 records. We used analyses of contingency table frequencies and logistic regressions to test hypotheses about temporal responses of local populations of rare flora. We found statistically significant effects of fire frequency on the colonization and extinction of rare flora; extinctions declined and colonizations increased with increasing fire frequency. There were statistically significant effects of both area occupied and stem number on the persistence and extinction of rare flora; extinctions declined and persistences increased with increasing area occupied and stem number. Relative turnover of rare flora was correlated with mean fire frequency and mean stem number. Relative turnover increased with increasing fire frequency and declined with increasing population size. Our analyses indicate the importance of fire and population size for the conservation of rare flora in this landscape. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011129-090701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consideration of Cost and Environmental Emissions of Solid Waste Management under Conditions of Uncertainty</field><field name="creator">Kaplan, Pervin Ozge</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Among the many models and tools available for solid waste management (SWM), the integrated SWM decision support tool (ISWM DST) developed at North Carolina State University provides a comprehensive and integrated approach that considers cost and environmental factors associated with a large set of waste processing options. ISWM DST is designed to generate alternative SWM strategies that meet user-defined cost and environmental objectives. In addition to an array of site-specific inputs, this tool includes a large number of model parameters, which are currently treated deterministically with point estimates for inputs. A high degree of variability and uncertainty is known to exist in these input parameters, affecting the uncertainty in the model outputs. The absence of a systematic procedure to consider uncertainty in ISWM DST is a major drawback. The goal of this study is to develop and incorporate an uncertainty analysis component into ISWM DST. A Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) procedure is coupled with a simulation approach to enable uncertainty propagation. The capabilities of this new component are demonstrated using a realistic case study in which a series of scenarios are examined assuming uncertainty in a subset of the input parameters. For each scenario, the alternative strategy development capabilities of ISWM DST is first applied, the then each SWM strategy is evaluated under conditions of uncertainty. Performance of alternative strategies is compared, and more reliable or robust strategies are identified. New and useful insights that were not apparent under deterministic conditions were gained, contributing more information to assist in SWM decision making. Further, correlation analysis was conducted to identify the uncertain input parameters that contribute mostly to the output uncertainty. This information is also expected to be valuable in making more informed decisions. In summary, this research contributes by significantly enhancing via the uncertainty analysis component the broad array of powerful capabilities of ISWM DST, making this tool more applicable in SWM planning and design practice. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-11-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011129-105110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Evaluation of an Apparatus to Simulate andMeasure the Lateral Pressure and Pore Pressure of a Sample of Fresh Concrete.</field><field name="creator">Sparks, Kevin C.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A small scale test apparatus to measure the total lateral pressure and pore pressureof fresh mortar under an applied pressure over time was developed at the North CarolinaState University Constructed Facilities Laboratory.

Per-Hop forwarding Behavior (or PHB) describes the forwarding path behavior required in network nodes, while the Per-Domain Behavior (or PDB) describes the behavior experienced by a particular set of packets as they cross a DiffServ domain. PHB and PDB implementations with traffic conditioners, provisioning strategies and billing models are building blocks used in Services Level Agreements (SLA).The goal of the project was to construct an SLA test-bed using soft DiffServ routing nodes. This test-bed, and the associated tools, is intended for in-depth studies of SLA translation and mapping algorithms. The specific objectives of the work reported in this thesis were to construct the test-bed, and then verify, validate and evaluate different elements of the SLA test-bed. Specifically, proof-of-concept experiments were conducted to show that one can implement a general Services Level Agreement (SLA) based on DiffServ, to show how to translate SLA requirements into real test-bed parameters, and then run experiments, collect data and make performance measurements.. The study is empirical and involves implementation of some of the quality of service (QoS) related IETF drafts and RFCs in a five-node soft DiffServ-based SLA testbed. This includes implementation and empirical evaluation of Expedite Forwarding (EF) PHB, Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB, Virtual Wire (VW) PDB, and of Assured Forwarding PDB.Virtual Wire PDB was implemented using both the Priority Scheduler and a Weighted Fair Queuing Scheduler. The effect of Best Effort packet size and rate on the protected EF traffic was investigated empirically. This provided proof of concept data on how successful can a VW implementation be in protecting Voice over IP (VoIP) streams. We used both emulated VoIP streams, and real VoIP phones in highly congested traffic environments.Assured Rate PDB was implemented using appropriate traffic conditioning, buffer management and scheduling techniques. The issue of what to do with non-conforming AF traffic was investigated empirically - whether to drop the non-conforming packets or to downgrade them to Best Effort. It was noticed that strict dropping of the non-conforming packets will sometimes underutilize the channel, while downgrading them to Best Effort will create a reordering problem.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-12-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011203-155700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of P-y curves for a Well Graded Gravel</field><field name="creator">Clark, Shane Cecil</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Research work is conducted to investigate the possibility of using laboratory model tests to simulate lateral response of drilled shafts embedded in soft weathered rock and discern their P-y curve function. Eight lateral load tests on instrumented model piles embedded in an Aggregate Base Course (ABC) medium are performed to evaluate the P-y curves. The ABC material is selected to simulate the response of soft weathered rock encountered in the field. The laboratory-evaluated P-y curves are compared to data from full-scale field tests performed in weathered rock. The two key parameters evaluated are the modulus of subgrade reaction (kho) and the ultimate lateral resistance (Pult). Using the laboratory-measured data, in comparison to measured field behavior, correlations for the subgrade modulus as a function of depth, as well as simplified approximations of Pult are developed for weathered rock materials. Results indicated that a hyperpolic P-y function seems to best represent the measured laboratory P-y curves. A comparison between laboratory and field data indicated that the ABC testing medium appears to yield kho and Pult that behave in a fashion similar to weathered rock material. Accordingly, it seems that, when appropriately mixed, that ABC can be used to model SWR encountered in the field. A distribution of kho with applied confining stress is evaluated and compared to results from procedures proposed by Reese (1997) for weathered rock and Terzaghi (1955) for stiff clay. A relationship developed for the distribution of subgrade modulus as a function of depth compared well with field data. The relationship of Pult with depth as a function of Geological Strength Index (GSI) and friction angle is also presented. All results are viewed in the context of the field measured response. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-12-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011203-234040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Properties of Polymer Blends Filled with Mixtures of Conductive Fillers</field><field name="creator">Thongruang, Wiriya</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;High-density polyethylene (HDPE), ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and blends thereof are used to produce ternary and quaternary conductive polymer composites (CPCs) containing carbon black (CB), graphite (G), carbon fiber (CF) and selected mixtures thereof to discern if polymer blends and mixed fillers yield appreciable advantages over CPCs composed of single polymers and/or single fillers.

The objective of this research is to develop and implement an algorithm that can accurately and efficiently predict backscatter yield and the trajectories and energies of electrons backscattered by solids. Taking into account the energy and direction of an incident electron, as well as the atomic number, atomic mass and density of the solid, our program determines a statistically reasonable path for the electron through the solid via Monte Carlo techniques. Such a model can and has been used in a variety of applications, but in this case we are interested in predicting the behavior of backscattered electrons. When applied to large numbers of electrons, the program provides statistically accurate results. In particular, excellent agreement is seen between the backscatter coefficients measured by Hunger and Kuchler and those predicted by our program. Furthermore, the angular distributions and energy distributions of backscattered electrons predicted by our program are consistent with those measured by Bishop.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-12-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011205-133453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FACTORS AFFECTING SEED PRODUCTION IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF LYSIMACHIA ASPERULIFOLIA POIR.

Botanists and land use managers across the species' range have observed low rates of seed production in natural populations. Low seed production may prevent establishment of new populations and production of new genotypes, thus limiting the ability of the species to survive diseases and changing environmental conditions. I conducted a study to determine causal mechanisms of the limited seed production at five natural populations in North Carolina. Using field observations and experiments, I examined pollen fertility, pollen compatibility, pollinator limitation, and population structure of L. asperulifolia.

Sensitivity analysis can help in identifying critical control points, prioritizing additional data collection or research, and verifying and validating a model. Ten sensitivity analysis methods, including four mathematical methods, five statistical methods and one graphical method, are identified. Application of these methods was also illustrated with the examples from various fields. These methods were compared on the basis of their applicability to different types of models, computational issues such as initial data requirement, time requirement, and complexity of their application, representation of the sensitivity, and the specific uses of these methods. No one method is clearly best for food safety risk models. In general, the use of two or more methods may be needed to increase confidence on the rank ordering of key inputs.To identify specific issues with respect to the application to a typical food safety risk model, the sensitivity analysis methods were applied to the risk assessment model of the public health impact of vibrio Parahaemolyticus (the Vp model). The Vp model was modified so that proper sensitivity analysis can be done on independent inputs. The results of the sensitivity analyses were interpreted and discussed in detail. The rank ordering of key inputs was reasonably similar for most of the methods. For example, five of the seven methods ranked water temperature, the number of oysters per meal, and a new input IUR in the top three. Time on water and an input IG were identified as the least important inputs by six methods.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-12-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011206-174616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE IMPACT OF ASPHALTENE CHEMISTRY AND SOLVATION ON EMULSION AND INTERFACIAL FILM FORMATION</field><field name="creator">Spiecker, Paul Matthew</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;	Petroleum asphaltenes (n-heptane insolubles and toluene solubles) and fractions more and less soluble in mixtures of heptane and toluene (heptol) were analyzed chemically and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Asphaltene chemistry and their propensity to aggregate in solution were correlated to the stability of water-in-oil emulsions and the strength of adsorbed films at oil-water interfaces. Solubility profiles of the more soluble and less soluble fractions in heptol indicated strong cooperative asphaltene interactions. The less soluble asphaltene fractions had lower H/C ratios, higher N, V, Ni, and Fe contents than the more soluble or unfractionated asphaltenes. Neutron scattering studies at 25 and 80&#176;C indicated asphaltenes near their solubility limit formed the largest aggregates. Highly aromatic solvents and the presence of petroleum resins disrupted intermolecular pi and hydrogen bonding and reduced the degree of aggregation. Less soluble fractions formed aggregates considerably larger than the unfractionated asphaltenes (as high as 520 &#197;), while soluble asphaltenes formed the smallest aggregates (as low as 22 &#197;). Enhanced aromatic pi-pi bonding, dispersion forces and hydrogen bond interactions within the less soluble fraction likely caused large aggregate formation and low solubility. 
	Emulsion stability was gauged by the volume percentage of water resolved after centrifugation at high speed (15,000 rpm). Strong emulsion formers were characterized by intermediate to large aggregates with lower aromaticity and higher nitrogen polarity, Ni and V. Asphaltenes aggregating due primarily to H-bonding and by pi-pi interactions were presumed to form a cohesive interfacial oil-water film and stable emulsions. At low aromaticities (&lt; 30 % toluene), asphaltenes were poorly solvated without resins and did not form stable emulsions. Increasing the resin-asphaltene ratio to 5 or 10:1 of the less soluble asphaltene fractions significantly enhanced emulsion stability (&lt; 20 vol % water resolved). Higher R/A (&gt; 20) led to emulsions with partial stability (40-80 % water resolved). 
	A biconical bob interfacial shear rheometer was used to study the properties of asphaltene films at oil-water interfaces. The degree of film consolidation was determined from ratios of elasticity (G')/film mass and yield stress/G'. Asphaltenes with higher concentrations of heavy metals (Ni: 330-360 ppm, V: 950-1000 ppm), lower aromaticity (H/C: 1.24-1.29), and higher polarity (N: 1.87-1.99) formed films of high elasticity, yield stress and consolidation. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-12-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011210-182530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LONG-TERM NITROGEN MANAGEMENT IN BIOREACTOR LANDFILLS</field><field name="creator">Price, G Alexander</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;One scenario for the long-term nitrogen management in landfills is ex-situ nitrification followed by denitrification in the landfill. The objective of this research was to measure the denitrification potential of actively decomposing and well decomposed refuse. A series of 10-L reactors that was actively producing methane was fed 400 mg NO3-N /L every 48 hr for19 to 59 days. Up to 29 nitrate additions were either completely or largely depleted within 48 hr of addition and the denitrification reactions did not adversely affect the refuse pH. Nitrate did inhibit methane production but the reactors recovered their methane-producing activity with the termination of the nitrate addition. In well decomposed refuse, the nitrate consumption rate was reduced but was easily stimulated by the addition of either acetate or an overlayer of fresh refuse. Addition of a high acetate to nitrate ratio did not lead to the production of NH4+ by dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Although the population of denitrifying bacteria decreased by about five orders of magnitude during refuse decomposition in a reactor that did not receive nitrate, rapid denitrification commenced immediately with the addition of 400 mg NO3-N/L. These data suggest that the use of a landfill as a bioreactor for the conversion of nitrate to a harmless byproduct, nitrogen gas, is technically viable.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2001-12-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011214-153926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting Herbicide Dissipation in Container Nursery Crop Production - A Method for Improving Herbicide Performance and Reducing Hand Weeding</field><field name="creator">Judge, Caren A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JUDGE, CAREN ANN. Predicting Herbicide Dissipation in Container Nursery Crop Production ? A Method for Improving Herbicide Performance and Reducing Hand Weeding. (Under the direction of Joseph C. Neal.)&lt;/p&gt;In southeastern U.S. container nursery crop production, frequent applications of preemergence herbicides supplemented by hand weeding are relied upon for broad-spectrum weed control during the growing season. Experiments were conducted to determine the aqueous concentrations required for weed control, to relate this to surface-applied rates, and to determine trifluralin dissipation in container substrates. Petri dish experiments were conducted to determine the aqueous concentration required for control of common nursery weeds including ) were also included as potential bioassay species. Herbicides evaluated were isoxaben, oryzalin, and trifluralin. The relative response of weeds to aqueous concentrations was similar to that observed in efficacy trials. Concentrations of Gallery required for 80% inhibition (I80) were 1.3 and 0.4 for eclipta, 0.4 and 3.9 for hairy bittercress, 0.5 and 0.3 for spotted spurge, 1.5 and 0.3 for large crabgrass, and 1.6 and 0.1 ug ai/mL for lettuce shoot and root, respectively. I80 values for Surflan were 9.8 and 0.4 for eclipta, 5.9 and 1.6 for hairy bittercress, 1.2 and 1.4 for spotted spurge, 1.2 and 0.1 for large crabgrass, and 17.4 and 0.6 ug ai/mL for lettuce shoot and root, respectively. I80 values for Treflan were 73.8 and 3.4 for eclipta, 17.3 and 7.4 for hairy bittercress, 6.2 and 9.2 for spotted spurge, 1.1 and 0.5 for large crabgrass, 7.2 and 8.4 for lettuce, and 0.9 and 1.2 ug ai/mL for perennial ryegrass shoot and root, respectively. Oat I80 values were well beyond the concentration range tested and extrapolated values were not realistic for Gallery and Surflan. However, Treflan I80 values were 0.5 and 2.1 ug ai/mL for shoot and root inhibition, respectively. Treflan dose-response experiments were conducted in the greenhouse and outdoors to determine the surface-applied rates necessary for preemergence control of large crabgrass and perennial ryegrass. The rates of Treflan in the greenhouse were 0.07 to 2.24 kg ai/ha and outdoors were 0.14 to 4.48 kg ai/ha. Percent control was estimated 3 and 6 weeks after treatment (WAT); shoot fresh weights were measured 6 WAT. In the greenhouse, approximately 1.0 kg ai/ha was necessary to control both species. Outdoors, less than 2.0 kg ai/ha was needed for control of both species 3 WAT. By 6 WAT, 2.6 and 3.4 kg ai/ha were required to control perennial ryegrass and large crabgrass, respectively. Additionally, an experiment was conducted at two locations to determine the dissipation of Preen (trifluralin) in a pine bark plus sand potting substrate and to compare grass inhibition over time. Preen was surface applied at 4.5 kg ai/ha, then large crabgrass and perennial ryegrass were seeded 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 WAT. Shoot and root growth were measured two weeks after seeding. Substrate samples taken 0, 1 and 3 days after treatment and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 WAT from the top 2 cm of the potting substrate were extracted and trifluralin content quantified by gas chromatographic techniques. In the March to May test, 50% weed growth occurred approximately 7 WAT, at which time weeds emerged and flourished. However, in the May to July test, trifluralin dissipated more rapidly. Growth (50%) occurred within 2 to 7 weeks after application, depending on species. These data suggest that trifluralin residues in the surface of the potting substrate decrease rapidly after application and slowly thereafter reaching what may be considered critically low levels approximately 4 to 6 weeks after application. These results suggest that for trifluralin, the common reapplication interval of 8 to 10 weeks in the southeastern U.S. may need to be shortened to 4 to 6 weeks. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011214-215833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTER MODEL FOR SOUND PROPAGATION IN HUMAN THORAX</field><field name="creator">Narasimhan, Chandrasegaran</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the research has been to develop a mathematical-computer model for sound propagation in human thorax.

The results from the analysis suggest that frequencies of the order of 100Hz are most effectively transmitted through the thorax and there seems to be a resonance effect at 1500Hz. Further analysis indicates that the resonance frequency could be due to the spatial confinement of the sound waves within the thorax. The model also exhibits a spatial inhomogeneity of sound propagation.

Air pollution dispersion is known to be controlled by several boundary layer factors. Eddy diffusion, described by the amount of turbulent kinetic energy, is the main influence on how quickly a parcel of polluted air expands and boundary layer depth determines the extent of vertical mixing potential. This thesis explores the influence that mesoscale surface related features have on the boundary layer meteorology and air pollution dispersion through a combination of numerical model simulations and observations. Mesoscale processes including sea breeze and land breeze circulations, vegetation and soil type gradient induced circulations, urban heat island and terrain modified flows are addressed in this research through the use of various numerical simulations. Surface based observations from a meso-network and ground based remote sensing observations using two SODARs are examined. These observations are also utilized for model validation.&lt;p&gt;An observational analysis of 10 m micrometeorological tower measurements and collocated SODAR measurements is conducted for two different boundary layer events, which correspond to near neutral and convective conditions. SODAR data analysis of reflectivity and wind speed profiles is presented along with tower measurements of wind speed/direction (at 2 m, 5 m and 10 m levels) and the temperature difference between 10 m and 2 m. The analysis indicated dramatically different boundary layer structures during these events.&lt;p&gt;The near-neutral case shows that the boundary layer properties remained relatively constant during the 24-hour period, as indicated by the SODAR reflectivity that consisted of homogeneous echoes up to a height of about 100 m. The static stability, implied by the observed 10 m - 2 m temperature difference (&#196;T10m-2m), supports a neutral, well-mixed boundary layer. The wind speed profile indicated time dependent fluctuations in magnitude associated with shear induced boundary layer eddies.&lt;p&gt;The convective case shows a rapidly increasing boundary layer during the early morning, just after sunrise. Strong fluctuating periods of high reflectivity during the day allude to convective boundary layer thermals. At the same time, near surface temperature gradient (&#196;T10m-2m) shows strong buoyant instability. The overall convective pattern and associated boundary layer momentum is much different than that of the neutral case. &lt;p&gt;Numerical simulations, using the Advance Regional Prediction System (ARPS) includes an idealized tropical seabreeze simulation over India, a regional scale simulation over eastern North Carolina and a city scale simulation over Raleigh, North Carolina. Using both the seabreeze and city scale meteorological simulations, coupled ARPS-CALPUFF dispersion simulations are conducted to investigate the influence of the boundary layer meteorology on dispersion patterns.&lt;p&gt;The 5 km resolution seabreeze simulation shows that the boundary layer properties are distinctly different across a region that is affected by seabreeze circulations. The dispersion experiment from a point source near the coastline indicated that the seabreeze has a very noticeable effect on atmospheric dispersion overland. Higher surface concentrations are modeled during the seabreeze episode and the post seabreeze period later in the evening.&lt;p&gt;The regional numerical simulation (6 km grid spacing) over eastern North Carolina combined several interesting boundary layer scenarios. The typically warmer Sandhills region and some of the larger urban centers are simulated as warmer surfaces. Turbulence is also higher over these warmer locations. Landuse is shown to have a definite impact on the degree of simulated turbulence as well as the boundary layer height. &lt;p&gt;The high-resolution atmospheric simulation conducted over Raleigh, North Carolina is for the same case presented by the regional simulation. The 1 km model forecast shows large distinctions within the microscale boundary layer structure over the city scale domain. The boundary layer variations are directly related to the landuse parameterization. During the night, the model is sensitive to terrain variations. Over the more elevated areas the wind speed was overall higher, while noticeably weaker over low-lying areas. A simulated down slope flow at night is detected and associated temperatures are less in the low-lying areas. The data from both SODARs compares well with the simulated profiles. &lt;p&gt;Dispersion patterns utilizing the high-resolution meteorology are influenced by the landuse in several respects. The 1 km ARPS simulation showed microscale convergence zones develop along strong surface temperature and sensible heat flux gradients, which are mostly a result of vegetation differences between the urban areas in/around Raleigh and surrounding rural areas. In the dispersion simulation, these convergence zones are directly related to higher surface concentrations. &lt;p&gt;The elevation is shown to influence the wind field at night, therefore modifying the concentrations field. More elevated areas, specifically the higher north-south ridge in the western part of the domain is associated with slightly stronger wind at night and therefore lower concentrations. The lower lying areas are more stable as a cooler slope flow is established at night. This drainage flow allows pollutants to collect over some of the highly populated suburbs around Raleigh.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011228-115426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fixed-Abrasive Diamond Wire Saw Machining</field><field name="creator">Clark, William Isaac</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The goal of this research was to investigate the use of fixed abrasive diamond wire saw machining with wood and foam ceramic materials. Fixed abrasive diamond wire saw machining was developed in recent years to allow for thin kerf slicing of advanced semiconductor materials. The main advantages of this machining technology for the use in wood machining are its thin kerf loss and unidirectional cutting capability.The design of cutting experiments using a spooled wire saw is presented. The first experiment tested the response of machining wood repeatedly with the same process parameters. The next experiments tested the effect of changing wire axial speed and saw rocking motion conditions for pine and oak wood materials. Finally, an experiment was designed to machine three types of foam ceramic materials. A data acquisition system was constructed and signal-processing techniques for removing noise were developed. The data collection system was used to record forces and certain machine parameters during wire cutting. The machined surfaces for the wood materials were measured to determine their roughness. A Scanning Electron Microscope was used to examine new and used wire as well as cutting debris to study the effects of wire wear. Finally, the results and the direction of future work in this area are discussed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20011229-110053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population Dynamics of Largemouth Bass in Lucchetti Reservoir, Puerto Rico</field><field name="creator">Ozen, Ozcan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Juvenile largemouth bass C annually.

The effect of these hydrological variables on largemouth bass recruitment appeared to be exponential rather than linear. Age-1 largemouth bass comprise the majority of the fishable stock in Lucchetti Reservoir, and the stock is typically below carrying capacity.

However combinatorial auctions present inherently hard computational problems for agents and auctioneers. In particular (1) the auction must solve the winner determination problem, which is NP-complete and (2) the agents must solve the value determination problem which can be intractable when computing a precise valuation for the bundles.The winner determination problem can be addressed by (1) developing algorithms which solve the problem of computing the optimal solution; (2) developing heuristics which approximate the solution quickly. The combinatorial auctions, proposed in the literature are dependent on the optimal solution of the winner determination problem, which is intractable for large number of agents and items.In this thesis we study the effects of using approximate winner determination in a particular iterative combinatorial auction : A1BA. We categorize the effects of approximation and develop several corrective methods which reduce the errors due to approximation in several categories.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020101-184651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auxin-induced gene expression in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.)</field><field name="creator">Busov, Victor Borissov</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Auxin is an important plant growth regulator affecting many aspects of plant growth and development. Maturation is an epigenetic developmental process that affects several processes and traits of economic importance that are regulated by auxin. Among these are elongation growth, wood formation and adventitious rooting. We hypothesized that maturation blocks auxin-regulated pathways that carry out these processes. The objective of this study was to identify genes that are differentially expressed in mature and juvenile loblolly pine shoots after auxin treatment.We used microarray screening to identify auxin-induced genes from loblolly pine. From about 200 putatively differentially expressed ESTs, nine were chosen for further study. Induction levels from the microarray analysis were verified by northern blotting using the same RNA that was used in the microarray probe synthesis. We found good correspondence for seven of the nine clones. However, the induction levels of two clones were underestimated by the microarray. Sequence analysis of the nine clones indicated that they encode proteins that belong to different functional groups and pathways. Three clones encode methionine synthase (MS), serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHM) and caffeoyl-CoA-methyltransferase (CCoAM). These three enzymes are involved in the pathway leading to production of lignin, supporting the role of auxin in the lignification process. Two other clones show homology to light-induced genes, indicating interaction between auxin and light signaling pathways. One of these clones (9228) is a repressor of plastid rRNA gene, suggesting that auxin may repress photomorphogenesis. Three clones encode proteins previously implicated in root-related developmental processes. One (6ca1) shows homology to a subtilisin protease (AIR3) and another (7cg8) to a proline rich protein (AIR1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. Both Arabidopsis genes are induced by auxin and are expressed during lateral root formation. The third clone (5ng4) showed homology to the MtN21 nodulin from Medicago truncatula that is induced after Rhizobium inoculation. Auxin may play an important role in nodule formation, possibly by triggering a lateral root developmental program that is later modified by the symbiont into nodule formation.We used northern blotting to characterize the expression patterns in mature and juvenile shoots treated with auxin. In addition to the nine clones identified in this study, we screened for differential expression five pine genes (LPEA1-5) that show homology to the Aux/IAA gene family. We found significant expression reduction in mature shoots only for 5ng4. This pine auxin induced nodulin1 (PAIN1) clone was further characterized. The full PAIN1 predicted protein sequence indicates that this is most likely a membrane protein with 10 transmembrane helices, the N- and C-termini in the cytoplasm and a pore-like region separating the two five- transmembrane domains with high sequence conservation in Arabidopsis, Oryza and Medicago. The high degree of conservation indicates essential function in plant growth and development. A large gene family of 38 members was identified in the Arabidopsis genome. The functional significance of this redundancy is most likely associated with functional divergence and/or the need for expression specificity of the different family members. PAIN1 induction is auxin-specific and is restricted to stems, hypocotyls and roots, all three competent to form lateral or adventitious roots. Differential expression of PAIN1 was also found in developing xylem forming top and bottom wood. The localization of a PAIN1:GFP fusion protein at the periphery of tobacco cells is consistent with the transmembrane sequence predictions. The occurrence of the fusion protein in punctate structures that could be part of the Golgi apparatus is consistent with the sequence predictions that the protein is targeted to the secretory pathway. Further determination of the biochemical and developmental function of the genes identified here should increase our understanding of auxin-dependent processes and how they are affected by maturation.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020102-091427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical Deposition of Nanocrystalline Copper and Copper-Based Composite Films</field><field name="creator">Deng, Hua</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; Free-standing nanocrystalline copper-based composite and particle-free copper films were produced by direct- and pulse-current plating. Nanosize 50-nm Al2O3 or 5-nm diamond particles were codeposited into a copper matrix prepared on a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The electrolytes contained CuSO4.5H2O (0.25 M), H2SO4 (0.56 M or 1.5 M), 50-nm Al2O3 (12.5 g/L or 1.0 g/L) or 5-nm diamond (0.5 g/L) particles, and gelatine (0.1 g/L, 0.05 g/L, or 0.02 g/L). The deposition was carried out at room temperature. The RDE was rotated at 1800 rpm for high-alumina particle baths (12.5 g/L) and 1000 rpm for low-alumina particle (1.0 g/L), diamond particle (0.5 g/L), and particle-free baths. The free-standing composite and copper films were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro hardness tester, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Grain size and crystal texture were obtained by XRD measurement. SEM gave information on surface morphology and composition of films. The hardness of nanocrystalline materials was measured by micro hardness tester. TEM was used to confirm the presence of nanocrystalline copper grains. The uncompensated potential became more cathodic with increasing current density in pulse-current plating. The current efficiency was in the range of 0.93 &#168;C 1.09 for both direct- and pulse-current plating. Gelatine concentration, the presence of nanosize dispersoids, and pH have no significant effect on electrode potential and current efficiency. Grain size decreased with increasing current density for particle-free copper and most of the composite films by direct- and pulse-current plating. The microhardness of nanocrystalline materials was increased by decreasing grain size for most of the particle-free copper and composite films. The existence of high-angle grain boundaries in nanocrystalline films resulted in negative Hall-Petch slopes. The presence of low concentration of alumina or diamond particles had no effect on grain size and microhardness. The pH had no obvious influence on grain size, microhardness, and alumina content in composite films. Random crystal texture is observed for Cu-Al2O3 composite and particle-free copper films and the (111) preferred texture for Cu-diamond composite films. The (100) preferred substrate orientation had no effect on deposit texture. The current density for both direct- and pulse-current plating had no significant effect on material texture. The presence of particles has no significant influence on nanocrystalline texture. Surface morphology varied for films made under different bath conditions. High gelatine concentration resulted in low-particle impregnation. Films made using 0.1 g/L gelatine resulted in spherical particles with grain size of 64 nm and porous surface. Films made using 0.02 g/L gelatine resulted in smooth surface with smaller grains of 40 nm. Films with high-alumina particle embedding, for example sample 7/9-1, resulted in porous and dark surface. High-alumina particle concentration (12.5 g/L) with 0.02 g/L gelatine in the deposition baths resulted in high-alumina content (0.11 wt% - 2.76 wt%) in composite films. The higher current density (297 mA/cm2) resulted in the lower alumina particle (0.076 wt%) embedding rate for the same bath parameter setting. The presence of both Al and O was found in copper-alumina composites and C element (diamond) was detected in copper-diamond composite films by EDS. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020103-173702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elliptical Diamond Milling: Kinematics, Force and Tool Wear</field><field name="creator">Cerniway, Matthew Allen</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Machining with diamond tools, whether turning or milling has proven itself as themanufacturing process that produces the highest quality surface finish, with the leastamount of form error in the minimum amount of time. However, due to tool wear and theamount of force generated during conventional machining, diamond tools cannot be usedon carbon containing materials such as steel and brittle materials such as silicates. In anattempt to by-pass the material limitations of diamond machining, a new machiningprocess called vibration assisted machining (VAM) has been developed. VAM involvesoscillating the diamond tool, bringing it into and out of contact with the material in rapidsuccession. VAM can either be 1-dimentional (1D), oscillation in a single direction, or 2-dimensional (2D), a summation of two independent tools motions. Currently, researchefforts are focused on 2D vibration machining, 2D tool motion haven been shown to besuperior to 1D tool motion. Over the past 10 years, 2D VAM with diamond tools hasbeen demonstrated to reduce the amount of machining force and increase tool life whenmachining carbon-containing materials over that of conventional machining processes.However the mechanisms of this improvement have yet to be discovered. This researcheffort is focus on: 1) discovering the fundamental mechanical principals behind theimprovement, force reduction and tool wear, 2) developing a model that predicts thecutting forces and tool contact times, 3) establishes guidelines for the use of vibrationassisted machining and 4) developing an industrial grade 2D VAM servo. The reductionsin tool wear and machining forces are related to the path geometry of the diamond tooland the speed and the depth at which it engages the workpiece. A model has beendeveloped and experimentally verified for 2D VAM which predicts the machining forcesand workpiece / tool contact time if the material properties are known. Along with themodel, a set of charts has been developed for both 1D and 2D VAM that relate the keymachining variables to one another. Lastly, a robust 2D VAM diamond tool servo hasbeen designed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020104-082326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seed Germination Studies of Southern Seaoats (&lt;i&gt;Uniola paniculata&lt;/i&gt;)</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Tyler Lynne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Seeds of southern seaoats (.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticultural Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020104-103616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing 100-meter-wide loblolly pine corridors as breeding habitat for landbirds</field><field name="creator">Amacher, Andrew James</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;I evaluated the suitability of 100-meter-wide loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation corridors as breeding habitat for landbirds. The study was located within the Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina on land owned by Westvaco Timber Corporation. The typical rotation-age within the landscape was 20 years. Work was conducted within post-rotation-age (24-31 years) corridors (100-meter-wide linear loblolly pine plantation stands) and patches (typical Westvaco stands). Work was also conducted in rotation-age patches (18-22 years). Vegetation, point count and nest monitoring data were used to compare corridors against patches. Point count surveys were conducted from 1995-1999, and vegetation and nest surveys from 1997-2000. Vegetation data was collected between 1997-2000 within post-rotation-age corridors and patches (24-31 years) and rotation-age patches (18-22 years). I used 10th acre plots to quantify the following variables: pine, hardwood, and snag basal area; pine, hardwood, and snag dbh; canopy cover (%) and shrub cover; overstory and midstory height; and cane and vine cover. Cluster analysis of individual plots found that post-rotation-age corridors and patches were not significantly different (p = 0.1178) from each other, but were significantly different from rotation-age stands (p &lt; 0.0001). Individual comparisons between classifications (post-rotation corridors and patches, rotation-age patches) found most significant differences between post-rotation-age and rotation-age stands. However, post-rotation-age corridors and patches differed significantly in pine basal area (p &lt; 0.0001), pine DBH (p &lt; 0.0001), hardwood basal area (p = 0.0153) and shrub percent cover (p = 0.0358). Point count data was collected from 1996-1999 within post-rotation-age corridors and patches. A total of 94 corridor points and 116 patch points were surveyed from 1996-1999. Corridors had greater species richness (N=44) than patches (N =38). However, species composition was similar between corridors and patches. For all species, the Spearmans rho correlation coefficient on species ranked abundance was highly correlated (r = 0.7877, p &lt;0.0001). In individual species comparisons, only the Red-eyed Vireo was found in lower abundance within corridors (0.213 birds/plot) compared to patches (0.440 birds/plot, p =0.0011). The Brown-headed Cowbird and Blue-gray Gnatcatcher were significantly more abundant within corridors relative to patches. Nest searching was conducted within post-rotation-age corridors and patches, and rotation-age patches from 1997-2000. Three species were compared: the Acadian Flycatcher (n = 132), Hooded Warbler (n = 37), and Northern Cardinal (n = 52). Across all years, no significant difference in nest survival was found between nests within post-rotation-age corridors and nests within post-rotation-age patches for all 3 species. However, when compared to rotation-age patches, Acadian Flycatchers had significantly higher nest survival in both post-rotation-age corridors and patches (p &lt; 0.05). Hooded Warblers had marginally higher nest success in both post-rotation-age corridors and patches relative to rotation-age patches (p = 0.05-0.10). Nest survival was also compared by distance to edge (with loblolly stands aged 0-5 years), distance to road, and distance to edge+road. No significant differences were found in nest survival for the Acadian Flycatcher, Hooded Warbler, and Northern Cardinal based on a nest's distance to edge, road, or road+edge. The Hooded Warbler had 10 out of 37 nests (27%) parasitized by the Brown-headed Cowbird. Nine were within patches and 1 within a corridor. Parasitzed nests were not significantly different from non-parasitized nests based on distance to edge (p = 0.7100), distance to road (p = 0.2111), or distance to edge+road (p= 0.2492). &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-16</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020104-125043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Nutrient Amendments and Genotype on StandProductivity and Crown Characteristics in Loblolly Pine(Pinus taeda L.)</field><field name="creator">Handest, Joshua A.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Handest, Joshua A. Effects of Nutrient Amendments and Genotype on Stand Productivity andCrown Characteristics in Loblolly Pine (Pinus taeda L.) (Under the direction of H. Lee Allen andSteven E. McKeand).Two provenances of loblolly pine, with five open-pollinated families from each were analyzed fordifferences in height, volume, leaf area, and various crown characteristics. Families from theNorth Carolina and South Carolina Coastal Plain (ACP) and from the ?Lost-Pines? area of Texas(LPT) were included in the study. In addition to studying potential genetic variation, half of theplots received fertilization treatments so that potential nutrient and genotype x environment(GxE) interactions could be assessed. The stands were established in 1993 and height wasmeasured annually until year 3 when both height and diameter at breast height were measured.Leaf area measurements were made in 1999 using the LI-CORE LAI-2000 PCA and destructiveand non-destructive sampling of individual branches was done to estimate the crowncharacteristicsNutrient additions starting at stand establishment resulted in large gains in juvenile developmentin height, volume, leaf area, and growth efficiency. Fertilization also dramatically increasedfoliage and branch biomass at all crown levels, and also contributes to an early shift of foliagefrom the lower crown to the middle. This is most likely due to early canopy closure. The AtlanticCoastal Plain provenance consistently outperformed the Lost Pine Texas provenance in height,volume, and growth efficiency. The ACP provenance had more foliage, predominately in themiddle crown than the LPT provenance, which may explain some of the productivity differences.There was a significant amount of variation in height, volume, leaf area, and growth efficiencybetween the families of both provenances. Both the vertical distribution and quantity of foliage inthe ACP families may explain some of the variation in volume growth and growth efficiency,though neither show enough of a direct correlation to explain all of it. The crown characteristicsstudied seem to indicate that distribution of foliage itself is more important in explainingdifferences among the LPT families.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-24</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020104-155704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of Cooperative Learning and Course Learning Environment Factors on Learning Outcomes and Overall Excellence in the Community College Classroom</field><field name="creator">Gilliam, Janice Hoots</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTGILLIAM, JANICE HOOTS. The Impact of Cooperative Learning and Course Learning Environment Factors on Learning Outcomes and Overall Excellence in the Community College Classroom. (Under the direction of Carol E. Kasworm.)This study tested the theory of social interdependence by examining the impact of cooperative learning (CL) in comparison to traditional instructional methods (identified in this study as non-cooperative learning, NCL) on 12 course learning environment factors, learning outcomes, and overall excellence of instruction and courses. It also investigated the relationship of 12 course learning environment factors on learning outcomes and overall excellence of instruction and courses. This study was conducted at a small rural comprehensive community college and utilized over 3000 student ratings of instruction as the primary data. The IDEA Center student rating form (IDEA Center, 1998b) was used to measure these variables. The Questionnaire on the Use of Cooperative Learning (Cooperative Learning Center, 1991) was used to identify faculty who taught courses integrating cooperative learning (CL) and those not integrating cooperative learning (NCL). Quasi-experimental representative design guided the investigation of an experimental group (students in CL courses) and a comparison group (students in NCL courses) comparing course learning environment factors, learning outcomes, and overall excellence of instruction and courses. Student ratings of CL courses were significantly higher than NCL courses on learning outcomes (p-value of .007). Additionally, CL courses were significantly higher than NCL courses on 10 of 12 course learning environment factors and learning outcomes. Six of these ten variables were significant at the .01 level. The difference between student ratings of CL and NCL courses on overall excellence was marginal (p-value of .042). The most significant finding was the impact of course learning environment factors on learning outcomes and overall excellence of instruction and courses, each with p-values of .000. A large portion of the variance in student ratings of learning outcomes (82%) and overall excellence of instruction and courses (88%) could be attributed to the course learning environment factors. This study was one of the first to extensively examine the theory of social interdependence through the impact of cooperative learning on student ratings in a community college. It also investigated how course learning environment factors impacted student ratings of learning outcomes and the overall excellence of instruction and courses. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020104-160957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">17b-Estradiol is Abundant in Skin and Regulates the Hair Follicle Cycle and Mirex Tumor Promotion</field><field name="creator">Porter, Karen</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Skin is a complex, hormone responsive tissue that functions as a barrier against water loss and infection. Estrogens have been shown to influence dermal thickness, vasodilatation and hair growth in skin. Remarkably, cutaneous E2 levels and capacity for E2 synthesis have not been fully assessed. We have determined that cutaneous17b-estradiol (E2) levels average nine times greater than serum E2 levels in female mice and that skin E2 is independent of serum E2. Additionally, we determined that estrogens are a major metabolite of testosterone in mouse skin explants, indicating that skin is a major site of extraglandular estrogen biosynthesis. Earlier studies have shown that castration accelerates hair growth in mice, and we have determined that castration induces a greatly diminished telogen phase, of the hair cycle. Previously our laboratory has shown that E2 blocks telogen to anagen transition of the hair cycle. We observed that only twice weekly 1 nmol E2 treatment reversed the effects of castration while daily treatment with 100 nmol testosterone or 25 nmol DHT was required, indicating that E2 is up to 100 times more potent than androgens. Previous studies have shown that mirex, a non-phorbol ester skin tumor promoter, promotes three times more tumors in female mice than OVX mice. E2 implants were able to restore 80% of the intact female mirex promotion response to OVX mice, indicating that E2 is the primary ovarian hormone that regulates mirex promotion. Since mirex promotes three times more tumors in female mice than in male mice, we conducted a tumor promotion study on intact and castrate mice given empty or E2 containing implants, and found that intact mice develop three times more tumors than castrated mice and that E2 implants fully restore intact male response to castrate mice, indicating that E2 also regulates mirex tumor promotion sensitivity in male mice. Collectively, these data indicate that skin is an important extraglandular source of E2 and skin E2 influences the hair cycle and chemical carcinogenesis.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020106-163304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OPTICAL MEMORY EFFECTS IN III-V NITRIDES</field><field name="creator">CHANG, YUN-CHORNG</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Optical memory effects in III-V Nitrides have been investigated. In order to have further understanding of this effect, qualitative and then quantitative measurements were performed to investigate this memory effect. A microscopic model consistent with most of the experimental observations was developed. Finally, verification of the model was performed.Experimental observations indicate that optical memory effects are flux-dependent effects, which require no lower power limit of the excitation source in order to produce them. Photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence studies indicate the yellow patterns are the result of increased yellow luminescence intensity from the sample. Heating up the samples can erase this memory effect.Blue luminescence, with an energy about 2.8 eV, is important in the explanation of the memory effect since it appears in the photoluminescence spectra of all the samples that exhibit memory effects. This leads to a model with two different transitions, yellow and blue luminescence, competing with each other to explain the memory effects. The blue luminescence is caused by electron transitions from a localized oxygen level to the deep isolated and hydrogenated gallium vacancies. Transitions from shallow silicon donor levels to the gallium vacancies result in the yellow luminescence. Intense ultraviolet light will remove hydrogen from the hydrogenated gallium vacancies and these vacancies will form complexes with neighboring oxygen atoms. These complexes will result in more yellow luminescence. Less blue luminescence and more yellow luminescence result in the yellow memory patterns observed. This model is consistent with most of the observations and several experiments strongly support this model. Potential applications for memory effects include optical data storage and optical signal processing.

(Under the direction of ODIS WAYNE ROBISON and ROGER LEE McCRAW).Straightbred populations of Dorset, Finnsheep, Composite I (50% Finnsheep, 25% Dorset, and 25% Rambouillet), and Composite II (50% Finnsheep, 25% Suffolk, and 25% Targhee) sheep were evaluated under three different twice-a-year breeding schedules. Ewes were exposed for 32 d starting on August 13 and February 5 for schedule I, on September 15 and March 10 for schedule II, and on October 22 and April 11 for schedule III. Approximately 100 ewes of each breed were exposed to rams during each breeding season. The experiment was conducted for five complete cycles starting with matings in the fall of 1984 and ending with matings in the spring of 1989. Data were obtained on 9419 lambs produced from 2334 ewes and 257 rams. Traits of primary interest were conception rate, litter size at birth, weaning weight, weaning weight adjusted for conception rate, litter weaning weight and litter weaning weight per ewe exposed. Lactation status had a significant effect on conception rate and litter size while number of lambs suckling did not have a significant effect on conception rate. Composite I ewes had the highest conception rates and litter size (P 0.10), both had larger litters (P &lt; 0.01) than the other two breeds. Ewes giving birth in spring had the highest conception rate and heaviest lambs (P &lt; 0.01). Animals bred in schedule I had the heaviest and largest litters, highest conception rate, heaviest lambs and highest litter weaning weight per ewe exposed (P &lt; 0.01). Efficiency of twice-a-year lambing systems is greatly affected by breeds, breeding schedules and seasons. Twice-a-year lambing programs must use the correct breeding schedule. Further, using composite breeds can be of great benefit.Genetic parameters for conception rate, litter size at birth, weaning weight, weaning weight adjusted for conception rate, litter weaning weight and litter weaning weight per ewe exposed were estimated using REML with animal models. Heritability estimates for conception rate were adjusted to a normal scale. Standard errors of heritabilities for conception rate were calculated using three methods, including bootstrapping. Heritabilities were estimated overall and within breed. Estimates of heritability for conception rate ranged from 0.17 &amp;#177 0.01 (Dorset) to 0.27 &amp;#177 0.01 (Composite I). Heritability estimates for litter size were 0.08 &amp;#177 0.01, 0.19 &amp;#177 0.01, 0.14 &amp;#177 0.01 and 0.13 &amp;#177 0.01 for Dorset, Finnsheep, Composite I and Composite II, respectively. Heritabilities for litter weaning weight and litter weaning weight per ewe exposed were similar across breeds and ranged from 0.31 &amp;#177 0.01 to 0.36 &amp;#177 0.01. Heritability for weaning weight was higher for Dorset (0.65 &amp;#177 0.01) than for Composite I (0.57 &amp;#177 0.01). Finnsheep and Composite II had similar heritabilities (0.41 &amp;#177 0.01). Overall heritabilities for litter weaning weight, litter weaning weight per ewe exposed, weaning weight, weaning weight adjusted for conception rate, conception rate and litter size were 0.33 &amp;#177 0.02, 0.35 &amp;#177 0.01, 0.64 &amp;#177 0.01, 0.64 &amp;#177 0.01, 0.24 &amp;#177 0.01 and 0.16 &amp;#177 0.01, respectively. Overall Spearman rank-order correlations of litter weight traits with conception rate or litter size ranged from 0.81 to 0.88. Correlations within breed were generally high and positive. Genetic correlations between dry and lactating ewes for conception rate and litter size were small (0.009 and 0.108, respectively), indicating that rank of sires was inconsistent under different environments (lactation status). Selection should be practiced among lactating animals for conception rate and litter size in twice-a-year lambing systems.Heritability estimates were moderate to high for weight traits and low to moderate for reproduction traits, indicating that selection in twice-a-year lambing programs is feasible. There was no substantial evidence that heritabilities and rank correlations were different among the four breeds. Litter weaning weight may be increased along with conception rate and litter size in a selection program based on twice-a-year lambing. Small genetic correlation between dry and lactating ewes indicated that grouping sires according to the lactation status of the ewes is necessary in a selection program.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-02-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020107-161344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pesticide Productivity Bias Due to Unobserved Variables</field><field name="creator">Norwood, Franklin Bailey</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; This research attempts to articulate the nature of two sources of bias typically present in pesticide productivity measurements. Knowledge of pesticide productivity is useful in forming pesticide regulation, hence, numerous attempts at measuring productivity have been conducted. These measurements are typically conducted in the absence of pest population, which has the potential to bias estimates. Productivity is often measured by the pesticide marginal product, and this marginal product is often calculated without information regarding the number of times pesticides are applied, which may also be a source of bias. Theoretical modeling reveals a productivity measurement bias likely exists due to unavailable pest population information, but its sign is indeterminate. Using potato data, productivity measurements conducted with and without pest population differ little. This suggests the bias, for this data, is empirically insignificant.Pesticide marginal products behave differently when the number of applications are not held constant. Modeling shows that when application frequencies are not held constant, the pesticide marginal product can be increasing or constant, suggesting they are not the type of marginal product economists usually think about. Using potato production data, productivity measurements are significantly lower when the number of applications is not held constant, implying the absence of application frequency variables are empirically important for pesticide productivity measurements.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020108-084652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ADAPTIVE ELECTRONIC INTERFACE FOR GAS SENSORS</field><field name="creator">Cavanaugh, Curtis</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;CAVANAUGH, CURTIS C. An Adaptive Electronic Interface for Gas Sensors (Under the direction of H. Troy Nagle).This thesis focuses on the development of an adaptive electronic interface for gas sensors that are used in the NC State electronic nose. We present an adaptive electronic interface that allows for the accurate mapping of the sensor?s voltage output to sensor resistance profiles. The adaptive interface uses a linearized Wheatstone bridge in a constant current configuration. The balancing of the bridge and the adjustment of the subsequent gain stage is performed using programmable variable resistors. The programmable resistors are controlled by a LabVIEW&#174; program. The same control program also determines and records all the resistor values in the interface circuit. The resistance of each sensor is accurately computed by LabVIEW&#174; using the interface-circuit, resistor values, and the voltage output of the circuit. Compensating for sensor drift can be done in LabVIEW&#174; by adjusting the programmable resistor values so that a zero-voltage output is produced during the reference cycle. By doing this zero adjustment between each ?sniff? of an odorant, the baseline drift can be minimized.A single channel of the adaptive electronic interface has been designed and tested. The interface can be calibrated so that it is 99% accurate when performing sensor resistance measurements.A new conducting polymer sensor chamber has also been designed and tested. The new radial flow sensor chamber was minimizes the dead volume in the chamber and also deliver the odorant to each sensor at the same time. Two operating modes were compared: continuous-flow and sniff-and-hold. Both modes gave good classification performance while testing four different coffee samples. Experimental testing indicates that sensor response is highly correlated with the sample flow rate. Future work to more fully characterize this correlation is recommended.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020108-121219</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the Performance and Emissions of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle based Lurgi Ammonia Synthesis System</field><field name="creator">Xie, Chi</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the risks and potential pay-offs of a new technology, the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC), a systematic approach for assessment needs to be developed. Characterization of the performance and emissions of the technology needs to be made comparable to conventional and other advanced alternatives. The current study deals with the development of models for estimating energy consumption and emission of a polygeneration IGCC based Lurgi ammonia synthesis process.Polygeneration IGCC is a multipurpose technology for waste control and co-production of energy and chemicals. The processes involved in IGCC include partial oxidation of carbonaceous materials to produce a synthesis gas (syngas) containing CO, H2 and hydrocarbons, for example, methane. After gas cooling and cleaning, the purified syngas can be used to produce chemicals such as methanol, ammonia, hydrogen etc., or drive a gas turbine to generate electric power after further gas saturation. The high temperature and pressure steam recovered from the system can also produce electric power, and the tailgas recover from desulfurization can be treated in Claus plant to produce sulfur. This research modeled the Lurgi ammonia synthesis process that will be integrated with a British Gas/Lurgi (BGL) Slagging gasifer-based IGCC system in ASPEN Plus, which is a powerful and versatile unit process simulation software. The Lurgi ammonia synthesis technology is based on partial oxidation of solid feedstock such as coal, or solid waste if incorporated with a more robust gasifier design. The liquid nitrogen wash, Rectisol process and recycle gas reforming and shifting make the Lurgi ammonia system capable to process different types of incoming syngas with significant amount of impurities. The ASPEN Plus performance model calculates mass and energy balances for the entire ammonia system. For validation, the model was calibrated to the best available reference. After setting up the design basis of Lurgi ammonia synthesis system, a case study was performed based on 1000 lbmol clean syngas input for ammonia synthesis. The clean syngas was produced from gasification on American Waste Fuel, which is an American 75/25 percent mixture of Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) and Pittsburgh No. 8 Bituminous coal. Based on the results from the case study, prediction on the performance and emissions of the ammonia model integrated with the IGCC system was performed, and the total power consumption of the base system was compared with the reference data for model verification. Then, sensitivity analyses on properties of incoming syngas, hydrogen to nitrogen ratio, purge gas recycle ratio and flow rate of incoming syngas were performed on the calibrated base case model to identify the key variables affecting the system-wide performance and emissions significantly and how. These sensitivity analyses can also be used to test the robustness of the model, which is critical for integration with the IGCC system. Based on the pre-assessment of the performance of the base case ammonia model integrated with the IGCC system, an IGCC system with about 447429 lb/hr of American Waste Fuel input can at least support an ammonia plant with 31979 lb/hr of ammonia production. But the typical yield of ammonia that can be supported by a calibrated IGCC system firing 287775 lb/hr of Pittsburgh No. 8 coal and without methanol production is about 1700 short tons/day. Through the sensitivity analyses, Operation near the stoichiometric point of the ammonia synthesis reaction was found to be the best choice from the perspective of electric energy consumption. Higher purge gas recycle ratios can better the conversion of ammonia, and reduce electric power, net steam consumption and emissions. Different feedstock had no obvious effect on the total electric power consumption of this ammonia system, but the composition of CO, CH4 and sulfur influence the steam consumption and emissions substantially. In order to make the model converge faster and more normally at different flow rates of incoming syngas, some of the design specification boundaries were changed. In the future, when the ammonia model is integrated with the IGCC system in ASPEN Plus, the fate of steam, purge gas, ammonia and sulfur emissions should be considered. In addition, a conventional ammonia model based on steam reforming of natural gas needs to be developed for Life Cycle Assessment, and Life Cycle Indexes should be compared between the conventional and Lurgi&#161;&#175;s ammonia synthesis processes to assess any advantages and disadvantages. Probability analysis methods such as Monte Carlo method or Orthogonal Latin Square experiment design should be introduced to optimize the model performanc, to identify which model parameters most affect performance and to quantify the uncertainty and variability associated with the model.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Civil Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020109-121100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stand and soil responses of a loblolly pine plantation to midrotation fertilization and vegetation control</field><field name="creator">Gurlevik, Nevzat</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This study wasconducted in a 14-year-old midrotation loblolly pine (&lt;i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'&gt;Pinus taeda&lt;/i&gt; L.) plantation to assess the effects of fertilizationand vegetation control (a) on soil net nitrogen mineralization, (b) litterdecomposition and (c) foliar nutrient concentrations and use, and vegetationgrowth.

An Exact Bidirectional Approach to the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. (Under the direction of Salah E. Elmaghraby) The aim of this research is to develop a new approach to the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. Traditionally, most exact approaches to solve the problem have been either Integer Programming approaches or Branch and Bound (BaB) ones. Of the two, BaB procedures have proven to be the more successful computationally. But, while it is quite intuitive to conceive that the root node of a BaB search tree should be the start activity, it is no less conceivable that it be the terminal activity. Indeed, it is conceivable that the search starts from both ends and concludes somewhere in the middle of the ensuing trees. Unfortunately, BaB as a methodology is not amenable to deriving a termination criterion for such a procedure which guarantees optimality. To a large extent, this research can be seen as an attempt at accomplishing just that. We start with a comprehensive review of the literature related to the problem. We present a new Integer Programming model to describe it together with a `look-ahead' heuristic procedure which may be used along with it. The main advantage of this procedure is its ability to reflect planning over the short horizon in anticipation of changes to the project in the more future. Our chief contribution is in the third part of this study which sets up the problem as a Shortest Path Problem in two `state networks', forward and reverse, where the nodes reflect the precedence feasibility or partial completion of the activities of the project. We develop the conceptual tools to construct the networks and to properly detect a `path' between their sources from which a makespan optimal schedule could be derived. The theoretical constructs ultimately result in algorithms that solve the problem proceeding forward, in reverse, or bidirectionally. These algorithms have been tested on the J30 benchmark data set of Kolisch, Sprecher and Drexl (1995). Computational results show important advantages of the bidirectional approach but also point out significant avenues for improvement.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-30</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020110-201041</field></doc><doc><field name="title" /><field name="creator">Montes, Cristian Rodrigo</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;MONTES, CRISTIAN RODRIGO. A Silvicultural Decision Support System for Loblolly Pine Plantations. (Under the direction of Dr. Lee Allen).Different heuristic techniques were used to solve the stand management problem. The techniques, together with a growth and yield model and an expert system, form the methodological components of a decision support system developed for deciding forest management activities throughout a stand rotation. Random search (RS), simulated annealing (SA) and tabu-search (TS), were used to solve the optimization problem. A Growth and Yield model for Loblolly pine in the Carolina piedmont was used to predict forest growth under different thinning and/or fertilization regimes. Silvicultural activities like competing vegetation control, soil preparation, and early fertilization were included as early growth treatments for different soil and site conditions. Response to establishment treatment was predicted using a knowledge system based on expected gain and growth response associated with several soil types. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to fine tune solutions from SA and TS. Recommended parameters for SA were: alpha = 0.99, max-iteration = 100000 and min-temperature = 0.01. The combination of two diversification techniques: least-used move and swap move were found to interact for improving solutions using TS.

Students' Perceptions of What Employers Consider Desirable Abilities, Attributes and Qualifications for Physical Therapists in Today's Workforce. (Under the direction of Don C. Locke.)In today's workforce, characterized by change and increasing competition for jobs, it is important for educational programs, students and practicing physical therapists to be aware of the qualities that are valued by employers. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the perceptions of physical therapy students about the abilities, attributes and qualifications that are desired by employers of physical therapists in today's workforce. Further, the study compared the perceptions of students with those of employers based on an earlier study of employers with a similar survey instrument.The population surveyed was students nearing completion of their second year of study in each of the seven physical therapy programs in North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC). Students were asked to respond to the survey from the perspective of an employer of physical therapists in today's workforce, and to indicate the relative importance of items (grouped as abilities, attributes and qualifications) on a six-response Likert scale ranging from Not Important (1,2) to Important (3,4) to Essential (5,6). The student survey contained the same core questions as an earlier survey of physical therapy employers from clinical settings in NC and SC, allowing comparison of the two populations. Analysis of the students' responses resulted in rankings of abilities, attributes and qualifications. The three most valued abilities were: (1) manage time effectively, (2) problem-solve/think critically, and (3) abide by rules and regulations. The three most valued attributes were: (1) ethical behavior, (2) integrity, and (3) a positive attitude. The three most valued qualifications were: (1) broad-based knowledge and skills, (2) an advanced master's degree in physical therapy, and (3) membership in the American Physical Therapy Association. Employers had the same top three abilities as students, but flexibility was above a positive attitude in the ranking of attributes, and manual therapy certification was above an advanced master's degree in the ranking of qualifications. Additional analyses examined the correlation between students' perceptions about the relative importance of the various abilities, attributes and qualifications and the amount of prior clinical experience (in weeks) that they had. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-15</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020111-165127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES: PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR INITIAL TRAINING PROGRAM</field><field name="creator">Metcalf, Ronald Carroll</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Metcalf, Ronald Carroll. Certified Nursing Assistants in long-term care facilities: Perceptions of their initial training program. (Under the direction of John M. Pettitt) Throughout the country, long-term care (LTC) facilities are faced with the challenge of providing residents with the essential care that this growing population deserves. One of the biggest challenges is the critical shortage of certified nursing assistants (CNAs) within the LTC industry. These essential frontline workers provide 90% of the care needed by residents living within these facilities. CNA training programs struggle to provide the LTC industry with well qualified care providers. This critical shortage is compounded by a career track that has maintained an excessively high turnover rate. Effective training programs could have a positive impact on this situation by preparing individuals with quality, realistic experiences during their initial training. Therefore, educators and regulatory agencies must be aware of the connection between the entire learning experience and the development of the CNA?s clinical care skills.Following an extensive literature review, a 45-item questionnaire was developed to determine if a relationship exists in the perceptions by the CNA of their initial training program and (1) the number of months since graduation; (2) the county they were employed; and (3) the type of state-approved training program they attended. The questionnaire was administered to 222 CNAs in eight LTC facilities within four counties of Western North Carolina.CNAs identified the instructor as having an important role related to the elements of effective teaching/learning. Interestingly, some CNAs felt that the length of the training program was ?too short? in relation to the skills needed to care for residents living in LTC facilities. Other CNAs reported that the ?clinical skills? was of most value to them, as related to the number of months since graduation. CNAs also identified components related to overall job satisfaction and the highest-ranking item was the ?ability to work as a team?; followed by the ?number of residents I care for each day?. This study will provide a foundation for future research in using an established questionnaire regarding CNA?s perceptions of their initial training and will provide individuals with the needed information to address job satisfaction for CNAs working in LTC facilities. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020116-181100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Coding Methods For Space-Time Wireless Communications</field><field name="creator">Hong, Zhihong</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;HONG, ZHIHONG. Robust Coding Methods For Space-Time Wireless Communications. (Under the direction of Dr. Brian L. Hughes.)Space-time coding can exploit the presence of multiple transmit and receive antennasto increase diversity, spectral efficiency, and received power, to improvethe performance in wireless communication systems. Thus far, most work on space-time coding has assumed highly idealized channel fading conditions (e.g., quasi-static or ideal fast fading)as well as perfect channel state information at the receiver. Both of these assumptionsare often questionable in practice. In this dissertation, we present a new and general coding architecture for multi-antennacommunications, which is designed to perform well under a wide variety of channel fading conditionsand which (when differentially encoded) does not require accurate channel estimatesat the receiver. The architecture combines serial concatenation of short, full-diversityspace-time block codes with bit-interleaved coded modulation. Under slow fadingconditions, we show that codes constructed in this way achieve full diversity and perform close to the best known space-time trellis codes of comparable complexity. Under fast fading conditions, we show that these same codes can achieve higher diversity than all previously knowncodes of the same complexity. When used with differential space-time modulation, thesecodes can be reliably detected with or without channel estimates at the transmitter or receiver. Moreover, when iterative decoding is applied, the performance of these codes couldbe further improved. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-17</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020117-144929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scheduling Precedence Related Jobs on Identical Parallel Processors</field><field name="creator">Ramachandra, Girish</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The problem of concern to us in this thesis is the scheduling ofprecedence-related jobs non-preemptively on two identical parallelprocessors to minimize the sum of the weighted completion times. The problemis known to be NP-hard.We develop, in chapter 2, a binary integer program which iscapable of solving only small size problems (no larger than 12jobs) to optimality at the present time. We also present a linearprogramming(LP) model adopted from the literature todetermine the lower bound on the optimum. This LP stands us ingood stead when we perform the optimization via the GeneticAlgorithm approach (which is the subject matter of chapter 3). Wealso present a dynamic programming formulation based on theapproach used for solving the "weighted earliness-tardiness"problem. Although DP expands somewhat the size of the problemsthat can be solved to optimality, its computing burden becomesonerous for more than 25 jobs.In an attempt to solve larger, and more realistic problems, a GeneticAlgorithm(GA) is presented in chapter 3. The salient feature of the GAmodel is that the "initial population" of trial solutions are not allrandomly generated but are constituted from a set of priority rules whichare known to be "good" relaxation (in the sense of being "close" to theoptimum) of the original problem. Also, generation of infeasible solutionsis avoided by the use of post-processing procedures after crossover andmutation operations. Computational results show that the GA approach arrivesto within 20% of the lower bound (and hence of the optimum) in very fewiterations.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020121-185145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Properties of Aluminum Oxide and Aluminum Oxide Alloys and their Interfaces with Silicon and Silicon Dioxide.</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Robert Shawn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;A remote plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method, RPECVD, was utilized to deposit thin films of aluminum oxide, tantalum oxide, tantalum aluminates, and hafnium aluminates.

Numerical Algorithm for Model Reduction of Linear Systemswith Polytopic Uncertainties. (Under the direction of Dr. Fen Wu).In this thesis, we study a H infinity optimal model reduction for polytopic uncertain linearsystem. The polytopic system has its state-space data contained in a convex polytope,a situation that often arises. The problem we are trying to solve is to find alower order polytopic uncertain linear system with a guaranteed H infinity norm error. Asuficient solvability condition is provided in terms of LMIs with one extra couplingrank constraint, which generally leads to a non-convex feasibility problem. To dealwith this problem a Cone Complementarity Algorithm with local convergence is used.As an extension a Weighted Model reduction method is proposed for polytopicuncertain linear systems.

Crop phenology and agronomy were also tested to determine the affects of rapid corn maturation and tillers on insect survival. Behavior and dispersal of larvae from the neonate to 10 day-old larval stage was measured in single variety plots of Bt and conventional plants. Each plot was artificially infested with one egg mass to test the hypothesis that Bt toxins affect larval behavior, increasing dispersal of early instars. Results indicated that crawling behavior of neonates was similar in both varieties but larvae settled faster on conventional plants. Larval dispersal among plants was also statistically similar in both varieties at all sampling dates. In separated plots, two larval densities and three planting dates were studied. Mortality of fall armyworm larvae in Bt sweet corn was not density-dependent. Early entry of the corn plant into reproductive stage apparently affected larval survival. There is not differential larval utilization and survival in tillers versus main whorls of Bt and non-Bt plants. Insect adaptation to Bt toxins is likely affected by larval dispersal and rapid maturation of corn plants.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020124-155923</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use of Constructed Wetlands to Remove Nitrogen and Phosphorus from Pumped Shallow Groundwater</field><field name="creator">Cook, Michael J.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;ABSTRACTCook, Michael J., The Use of Constructed Wetlands to Remove Nitrogen and Phosphorus from Pumped Shallow Groundwater. (Under the direction of Robert O. Evans).Non-point pollution has received significant attention nationwide with seepage from lagoons one potential source. The research presented here discusses the hydrology and shallow groundwater quality associated with leakage from an old, unlined lagoon located in the Middle Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Ammonium-N concentrations from wells installed between the lagoon and a nearby stream averaged 121 mg/L, with the highest concentrations exceeding 170 mg/L. Mean annual NH4-N concentrations in the stream ranged from 10 to 25 mg/L indicating that the seepage plume was reaching the stream. A water control structure was installed down stream of the lagoon to reduce the hydraulic gradient towards the stream. In addition, the lagoon was closed out in April 2001. The hydraulic gradient has decreased from 0.023 m/m when the lagoon was in production to 0.0026 m/m since closure. Over a 33-month pre- and post- closure period, NH4-N concentrations in wells 15 m down gradient of the lagoon have decreased from 121 mg/L to 96 mg/L. A series of pumping wells were installed in the seepage plume to remove and route the contaminated groundwater to a 0.35 ha constructed wetland for treatment. Inflow and outflow of the wetland were continuously monitored to determine nutrient loading and reduction rates. Fourteen monthly mass balances were computed to compare the inflow and outflow of the wetland and to assess monthly nutrient reduction for TKN, NH4-N, NO3-N, TP and OP. Overall, greater than 79 % of the nitrogen and 26 % of the phosphorus were assimilated on a mass basis while concentrations decreased by more than 87 % across all nutrient species. Oxidation-reduction, air and water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured weekly at several locations within the constructed wetland. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between these parameters and monthly nutrient reductions. Nutrient export from the wetland was positively correlated to water temperature (i.e., nutrient export increased as water temperature increased). In general, lower redox and DO were correlated to higher nutrient levels within the wetland and subsequently to higher export from the wetland. Caution should be taken on interpretation of these regression analyses as the conditions in the wetland changed over the course of the study. The loading rate was doubled at the beginning of the first full growing season (i.e., the loading rate was two times higher during the growing season than the previous dormant season). Another factor that likely impacted N and P assimilation is many plants in the upper portion of the wetland died in July and August of 2001. The hydrology of the site was evaluated using MODFLOW-GMS. MODFLOW was calibrated using water level data from the site and was used to evaluate the influence of water levels in the adjacent channelized stream on the movement of contaminants in the groundwater plume. Model results indicated a decrease in the hydraulic gradient from the former lagoon from 0.0045 m/m in the free drainage case to 0.0027 m/m in the controlled drainage case. From the gradient calculations, travel time of the seepage plume to the stream increased from 380 days free drainage scenario to 640 days in the controlled drainage case. MODFLOW analysis of the pumping wells indicated that 6.3 gpm was required in the free drainage mode to reverse the gradient from the stream and capture the seepage plume. In the controlled drainage mode, 4.7 gpm was required to reverse the direction of groundwater flow. A hydrologic analysis was also conducted to evaluate pumping requirements to mitigate an actively leaking lagoon. Simulations were performed using an interceptor drain (French drain) adjacent to the lagoon for collection of seepage discharge from the lagoon. Under controlled drainage, the interceptor drain collected 51.5 m3/day (9.4 gpm) while under free drainage 67.4 m3/day (12.4 gpm) would be collected. This analysis assumed a worst-case scenario where all wastewater deposited in the lagoon was lost to seepage. The research presented here provides strategies for clean-up of leaking lagoons or those lagoons targeted for closure. Overall, the wetland assimilated 383 kg of total nitrogen and 60 kg of total phosphorus during the 14 month study period. The wetland surface area was originally based on a pumping rate of 1.5 gpm which was the estimated seepage rate of the lagoon. In March 2001, the pumping rate was increased to 3.5 gpm to match growing season ET rates. Initial results indicated that the wetland assimilated this increased flux of nutrients; but as loading continued at this rate, nutrient concentrations in outflow began to increase, suggesting that this higher rate exceeded the assimilative capacity of the wetland. The MODFLOW analysis indicated that a pumping rate of 4.7 to 6.3 gpm was required to reverse the groundwater gradient from the stream. These pumping rates would require a wetland surface area three to four times larger than the wetland area used. The mass balance indicated that phosphorus mass exports were higher than imports for the final two months. From this, further study is needed to determine processes that are affecting removal of phosphorus. Plant uptake was responsible for only 9 % (35 kg) of the N and 18 % (11 kg) of the P assimilated. Oxidation-reduction reactions were judged to be the dominant nitrogen reduction mechanism. Considering the importance of plants in providing conditions conducive for nutrient assimilation, further investigations are needed to determine the cause of the plant die-off. The influence of temperature, dissolved oxygen and redox on nutrient assimilation should be further documented under conditions of constant loading.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-01-31</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological and Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020127-101348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Strain Relaxation in SiGe Growth on Uniquely Oriented Si Substrates</field><field name="creator">Ware, Morgan Ellison</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;WARE, MORGAN ELLISON. Effects of Strain Relaxation in SiGe Growth on Uniquely Oriented Si Substrates. (Under the direction of Robert J. Nemanich)The growth of SiGe epitaxial layers on Si has become the model system for studies of strain layer epitaxy. In this research solid source molecular beam epitaxy was employed to prepare the epitaxial films, and we have employed methods to quantitatively measure the strain in the film (Raman spectroscopy), the interface misfit structure (transmission electron microscopy), and the surface morphology (atomic force microscopy). This thesis explores the formation and subsequent relaxation of strain in SiGe films grown on substrates, which were identified to have unique stable surface structures. The substrates, with crystallographic surface orientations between (001) and (111), are characterized by atomic steps and facets aligned with the [-110] direction. Specifically, the substrates studied have surface normals rotated by 10 and 22 degrees from [001] representing a (118), and (114) - (113) faceted surface respectively. The interface misfit array on the (001) surface that is characterized by two orthogonal arrays was found to form in three unique directions on substrates with a large off-axis tilt. These dislocations align with the predicted intersections of the {111} planes with the substrates, and we derived an expression that describes the observations. We estimated the relaxation of a layer by determining dislocation densities in the TEM images. Notably, the relaxation will vary depending on the Burgers vector chosen to represent the dislocation arrays. A direct correlation was found with the pattern of misfit dislocations and the surface morphology of relaxed films grown on these off-axis substrates. The long range surface corrugations align well with the same three directions as the dislocations indicating that the formation of the misfit dislocations cause this alignment. Our studies of the strain showed that the strain relaxation increased linearly with film thickness indicating a kinetic process as opposed to a sudden plastic relaxation by misfit dislocation formation. In combining these results, we find that only a fraction of the observed strain relaxation can be accounted for with the observed density of misfit arrays. The organization and presence of the surface morphology indicates that the surface morphology also significantly contributes to the strain relaxation both in the coherently strained films and in the partially relaxed structures.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-02-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Physics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020130-131538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frequentist and Bayesian Unit Root Tests in Stochastic Volatility Models</field><field name="creator">Kalaylioglu, Zeynep I.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In stochastic volatility models, the unit root test on the time series of theunobserved log-volatilities may be performed by applying the commonly usedfrequentist unit root tests. For instance, augmented Dickey Fuller tests based on the log-squared meancorrected returns can be used. The log-squared meancorrected returns have the same second order properties as that of an autoregressive moving average process. However, we observed that the moving average parameter of the resulting process (based on the log-squared meancorrected returns) is typically close to the autoregressive parameter. For this reason,the unit root tests applied to stochastic volatility models tend to reject theunit root in finite samples. We propose a method for performing thefrequentist unit root tests in stochastic volatility models based on the finite sampling distribution of the well known test statistics. In addition to the frequentist testing procedures, Bayesian unit root testscan be used to test for a unit root in stochastic volatility models as well.A Bayesian test based on the Bayes factor has been suggested by So and Li (1999).In this approach, they work with the mean corrected returns instead of thelog-squared mean corrected returns. They treat the unobserved log-volatilitiesas missing observations. The prior densities they use for the autoregressiveparameter are continuous densities defined on an interval that does not include the value beingtested. Such prior densities for the autoregressive parameterare not suitable where one's main concern is to test for a unit root inlog-volatilities. We introduce a new prior density for this parameter that puts a positive mass on thepoint being tested. We also consider continuous prior densities defined on an interval that includes thepoint one. These prior densities allow us to use the posterior interval ofthe autoregressive parameter as a testing criterion.The advantage of our method is that it is simple and useful.The performance of these tests are demonstrated by a simulation study. We illustrate thetesting procedures by applying them to four sets of exchange rates.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-02-11</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020131-182642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergence and Evolution of Agent-Based Referral Networks</field><field name="creator">Yu, Bin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have shown that interpersonal communication acts as animportant channel for gathering information. But if we wish to rely oninterpersonal communication, we still need to figure out how to determinethe right person to ask. Usually we cannot find the potential expert(s)directly, and we need some assistance from our friends or friends'friends to locate them. The phenomenon of Six Degrees of Separationindicates that it is possible to use some intelligent software agents,who can interpret the links between people and follow only therelevant one, to find the desired experts quickly. A computational model of agent-based referral networks was proposed to assistand simplify the users to find potential experts for a specified topic in aperson-to-person social network, in which each user is assigned a softwareagent, and software agents help automate the process by a series of ``referralchains''. Unlike most previous approaches, our architecture is fullydistributed and includes agents who preserve the privacy and autonomy oftheir users. These agents learn models of each other in terms of expertise(ability to produce correct domain answers), and sociability (ability toproduce accurate referrals). We study this framework experimentally to seethe effects that the different variables have on each other and the efficiencyof the referral networks. Furthermore, a social mechanism of reputation management was proposed tohelp agents (users) avoid interaction with undesirable participants inthe referral networks. The mathematical theory of evidence is used torepresent and propagate the reputation information in a referral network.Our approach adjusts the ratings of agents based on their observations aswell the testimony from others. Moreover, we conducted several experimentsto study the reputation management in different settings. Social mechanismsare even more important when some centralized reputation managementmechanisms, i.e., trusted third parties, are not available. Our specificapproach to reputation management leads to a decentralized society in whichagents help each other weed out undesirable players.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-02-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020201-085537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Cycle Assessment in Pharmaceutical Applications.</field><field name="creator">Jim&#233;nez-Gonz&#225;lez, Concepci&#243;n</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; In the present work, life cycle information is developed to provide environmental input into process development and chemical selection within the pharmaceutical industry. The evaluation at various stages of the development process for Sertraline Hydrochloride, an effective chiral antidepressant, was conducted. This evaluation included the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) and further Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to compare several synthetic routes and production processes of this pharmaceutical product. To complete the Sertraline analysis, a methodology to generate gate-to-gate life cycle information of chemical substances was developed based on a transparent methodology of chemical engineering process design (an ab initio approach). In the broader concept of an LCI, the information of each gate-to-gate module can be linked accordingly in a production chain, including the extraction of raw materials, transportation, disposal, reuse, etc. to provide a full cradle-to-gate evaluation. Furthermore, the refinery, energy and treatment sub-modules were developed to assess the environmental burdens related to energy requirements and waste treatment. Finally, the concept of a &#193;&#164;lean/Green Technology Guide&#195;?was also proposed as an expert system that would provide the scientists with comparative environmental and safety performance information on available technologies for commonly performed unit operations in the pharmaceutical industry. With the expected future application of computer-aid techniques for combinatorial synthesis, an increase of the number of parallel routes to be evaluated in the laboratory scale might be predicted. Life cycle information might also be added to this combinatorial synthesis approach for R&amp;D. This input could be introduced in the earlier stages of process design in order to select cleaner materials or processes using a holistic perspective.

Highly purified SEB is needed in research and can be used as a standard in current detection methods for SEB. Inexpensive, robust ligands with high affinity would be suitable replacements for antibodies in biosensors for the detection of SEB. Affinity adsorption processes using short peptides as ligands show great promise in purifying and detecting proteins in comparison with other methods due to their high stability and low cost. We have found an affinity peptide ligand, YYWLHH, from a solid phase combinatorial peptide library that can separate SEB from E. coli lysate or BSA.

Synthesis and Analysis of Mechanism Based Inhibitors of Juvenile Hormone Epoxide Hydrolase from Insect Trichoplusia ni. (Under the direction of Russell J. Linderman) The research presented here entails a multi-disciplinary advance at understanding the role of juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase in the metabolism of juvenile hormone in last stadium Trichoplusia ni. The work combines synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry.A series of juvenile hormone analogs have been synthesized and their effectiveness to inhibit insect JHEH has been ascertained. Some of the key elements in the synthetic sequence for the fluorinated compounds include chemoselective oxidation of a primary alcohol in the presence of an alpha-fluorinated alcohol, introduction of a geminal difluoro group via a Reformatsky reaction or use of the DAST reagent, and selective nucleophilic and electrophilic epoxidation reactions. The synthesis of some of the non-fluorinated compounds employed regio-selective opening of an epoxide, Sonogashira palladium catalyzed cross coupling, nucleophilic epoxidation, and a variety of protecting group manipulations. Of all the inhibitors tested, the alkene 10 was the most effective alternative substrate with an I50 of 4.29 mM, slightly more potent than the benchmark MEMD. We also found that the introduction of fluorine increased the potency of the inhibitors compared to the non-fluorinated analogs. Lastly, inhibitor 5 provided insight to support a novel mechanism based inhibition of juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase by formation of a tetrahydrofuran intermediate. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-02-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020210-114921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Impact of a Palliative Care Educational Component on Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying in Undergraduate Nursing Students</field><field name="creator">Mallory, Judy Lynn</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Nurse educators have identified that historically nurses have not been preparedto care for dying patients. Research also has identified that nursing students haveanxieties about death, dying, and caring for dying patients. Several factors have beenidentified as affecting nurses', nursing students', and medical students' attitudestoward care of the dying. Factors addressed in this research will be death education,and death experience. As part of a national movement to improve end-of-life (EOL) care, schools ofnursing are starting to implement EOL education in their curricula. This researchlooked at one component of EOL education, which incorporates experiential learningusing Quint's (1967) model of death education and transformative learning theory.The educational experiences were geared to help students understand the skills neededto competently and compassionately care for the dying; those behaviors include: (1)responding during the death scene, (2) providing comfort, (3) responding to anger, (4)enhancing personal growth, (5) responding to colleagues, (6) enhancing the quality oflife during dying, and (7) responding to the family (Degner, Gow, &amp; Thompson,1991). The study examined the long-term effects of an educational experience todetermine if a one- time educational experience provides sufficient, lasting effects in a6-week format.Results of this study indicate that education can have a positive effect onnursing students' attitudes toward care of the dying. Nursing students in the treatmentgroup had a significant positive increase in their attitudes toward care of thedying after the treatment. It was also noted on the pretest that those students who hadprevious experience in caring for dying patients had a statistically significant higherpositive attitude toward care of the dying than those who did not have previousexperience in care of the dying. The attitude change increased slightly after a 4-weekperiod. The use of the End of Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) educationpackage along with experiences at hospice, the funeral home, the anatomy lab and roleplay help facilitate transformative learning in nursing students.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-02-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020212-121003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vitri - A Generic Framework for Engineering Decision Support Systems on Heterogeneous Computer Networks</field><field name="creator">Kumar, Sujay V</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Vitri is an object-oriented framework implemented in Java for high-performancedistributed computing. Using Vitri, applications can engage in cooperativeproblem solving by dividing their tasks among heterogeneous clusters of workstations and PCs. Vitri's features include basic support fordistributed computing and communication, as well as visual tools for evaluating run-time performance, and modules for heuristic optimization. It balances loads dynamically using a client-side task pool, allows theaddition or removal of servers during a run, and provides fault tolerance transparently for servers and networks. Among its more powerful featuresare modules for heuristic optimization and decision support tools such asmodeling to generate alternatives (MGA). Vitri also provides an asynchronous global-parallel genetic algorithm that is particularly suited for coarse-grained tasks executing on processors with large variations in processor speeds. By using dataflow techniques, in which computations areexplicitly based on the availability and forwarding of data, the usual end-of-generation synchronization points are removed from the algorithm.

The premise for this idea evolved from research regarding the annual U.S. News &amp; World Report college rankings, in which various factors are considered, including reputation. Since the athletic department is frequently referred to as the ?doorstep of the University,? the research sought to determine whether or not a winning athletic program does in fact enhance the reputation of a university, thus making it more appealing to talented students. Along with the annual rankings, a method called the Resource-Based View (RBV) was used to calculate athletic success, based on four characteristics that included win-loss record, compliance, graduation rates and financial health. Using the seven public institutions in the Atlantic Coast Conference as the subjects, the athletic departments were analyzed and ranked based on these criteria and evaluated against each institution?s ranking in U.S News using Spearman?s Correlation Coefficient. Although the results of the study did not result in the strong relationship between a winning athletic department and university success that was predicted, the small sample size was a factor.

Often the time to relapse is right-censored for some individuals due to incomplete follow-up. In some circumstances, it may also be the case that patients are known to die but the cause of death is unavailable. When cause of failure is missing, excluding the missing observations from the analysis or treating them as censored may yield biased estimates and erroneous inferences. Under the assumption that cause of failure is missing at random, we propose three approaches to estimate the regression coefficients. The imputation approach isstraightforward to implement and allows for the inclusion ofauxiliary covariates, which are not of inherent interest formodeling the cause-specific hazard of interest but may be related to the missing data mechanism. The partial likelihood approach we propose is semiparametric efficient and allows for more general relationships between the two cause-specific hazards and more general missingness mechanism than the partial likelihood approach used by others. The inverse probability weighting approach isdoubly robust and highly efficient and also allows for theincorporation of auxiliary covariates. Using martingale theory and semiparametric theory for missing data problems, the asymptotic properties of these estimators are developed and the semiparametric efficiency of relevant estimators is proved. Simulation studies are carried out to assess the performance of these estimators in finite samples. The approaches are also illustrated using the data from a clinical trial in elderly women with stage II breast cancer. The inverse probability weighted doubly robust semiparametric estimator is recommended for itssimplicity, flexibility, robustness and high efficiency.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-13</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020304-093950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF Si-SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; INTERFACES BY LINEAR AND NONLINEAR OPTICAL TECHNIQUES</field><field name="creator">WANG, JIH-FU TREVOR</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;WANG, JIH-FU TREVOR.

The analysis is performed using a generalized scattering matrix (GSM) approach. This approach employs different numerical techniques for analyzing the modules that make upthe system. The GSM of the overall system is obtained by cascading the GSM of each of the modules. Different numerical techniques such as finite difference time domain (FDTD) and mode matching are used here for an efficient and accurate analysis of a waveguide based power combiner/divider structure. This analysis makes it possible to further investigate the effect of the design parameters on the performance of the waveguide based power combiners.

The Importance of Leadership Competencies: Perceptions of North Carolina Community College Presidents. (Under the direction of George A. Baker III) This research investigated the relationship between certain institutional characteristics and perceptions of North Carolina community college presidents about the importance of leadership roles, values and emotions, and skills. Those characteristics were the size of the institution, the growth rate of the institution, and the geographic setting of the institution. The perceptions of three groups of presidents were studied. One group consisted of the presidents of large community colleges and the presidents of small community colleges. The second group consisted of the presidents of high enrollment growth colleges and the presidents of low enrollment growth colleges. The final group was comprised of presidents of urban community colleges and rural community colleges. Fifty-one of the 58 presidents participated in the study, a participation rate of 87.93 percent. The participants completed the Leadership Competencies Assessment Instrument, responding to 30 specific leadership competencies by estimating the degree of energy they expended in addressing each competency, and by estimating their effectiveness in addressing that competency. The means of responses from the first set of presidents in each group was compared to the means of responses from the second set of presidents in each group using the t-test for the difference between means. It was hypothesized that, for each of the three groups, there were no differences in perceptions about the importance of leadership roles, leadership values and emotions, or leadership skills. The results of the tests indicated that there were no differences in perceptions in any of three groups about which leadership roles, values and emotions, and skills were most important. It was recommended that future research address expanding the study population to include other community college systems; conducting future studies using different methodologies in order to increase validity; and additional study of individual leadership competencies and how they affect presidential leadership perceptions.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-08</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adult and Community College Education</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020307-095514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EVALUATION OF PREEMERGENCE AND POSTEMERGENCE HERBICIDE SYSTEMS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR OF CGA-362622 ON PURPLE AND YELLOW NUTSEDGE (Cyperus rotundus L. and C. esculentus L.)</field><field name="creator">Troxler, Shawn Christopher</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Purple and yellow nutsedge are herbaceous perennial weeds that are among the world?s worst pests. Nutsedge species are problematic due to their perennial nature, longevity of tubers, and prolific tuber production. Due to the relatively difficulty in reducing purple and yellow nutsedge populations, herbicide-management programs in cropping systems that target nutsedge species need to be developed. Field studies were conducted to evaluate potential reduction in purple and yellow nutsedge populations using sulfentrazone and glyphosate management programs and site-specific management in a tobacco and soybean rotation, as well as using sulfentrazone, glyphosate, and halosulfuron management programs in a soybean and corn rotation. All weed management systems reduced purple nutsedge densities similarly in the tobacco and soybean rotation. Sulfentrazone plus clomazone preplant incorporated (PPI) in tobacco or preemergence (PRE) in glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean reduced yellow nutsedge densities 82 and 99%, respectively. Postemergence (POST) treatments of glyphosate in GR soybean did not increase yellow nutsedge reductions when sulfentrazone was applied in tobacco or GR soybean. Glyphosate applied on a site-specific basis POST with a light-activated hooded sprayer (LAS) reduced yellow nutsedge populations as effectively as glyphosate POST broadcast treatments in GR soybean. Weed management systems that included sulfentrazone PRE fb the LAS in GR soybean reduced POST herbicide use by at least 86%, compared to broadcast applications. Sulfentrazone plus clomazone PRE alone in GR soybean followed by (fb) nicosulfuron POST in GR corn reduced purple and yellow nutsedge populations by 48 and 85% relative to the nontreated control, respectively. Clomazone PRE in GR soybean fb sequential treatments of glyphosate POST in GR soybean and in GR corn, reduced purple and yellow nutsedge populations equivalent to soybean PRE herbicide programs and other GR corn POST management programs. Halosulfuron POST treatments reduced yellow nutsedge populations (&gt; 90%) equivalent to glyphosate POST treatments in corn regardless of soybean PRE herbicide program. Greenhouse studies were conducted to evaluate cotton POST herbicides fb MSMA late postemergence (LPOST) for foliar and tuber reduction of yellow and purple nutsedge when applied to nutsedge foliage at two different application timings. CGA-3626222 treatments reduced purple and yellow nutsedge shoot and root/tuber dry weights equivalent to glyphosate POST fb MSMA LPOST. MSMA at 1120 and 2240 g ai/ha and glufosinate POST fb MSMA LPOST reduced purple and yellow nutsedge shoot dry weights, although reduction was greater at smaller nutsedge application heights. Less reduction was obtained with pyrithiobac POST fb MSMA LPOST. The addition of MSMA in mixture to other POST herbicides was of benefit for nutsedge growth reductions with pyrithiobac, but was seldom beneficial with other herbicides. These data initiated studies to evaluate the physiological behavior of CGA-362622 in purple and yellow nutsedge for possible reasons of control. Lab studies were conducted to evaluate absorption, translocation, and metabolism of 14C-CGA-362622 when foliar applied to purple and yellow nutsedge. Less than 53% of the herbicide was absorbed after 96 h. Both nutsedge species translocated appreciable herbicide (30%) out of the treated leaves. Translocation was both acropetal and basipetal, with at least 25% transported basipetally. Neither nutsedge species translocated over 4% of applied radioactivity to the tubers and roots. Most of the metabolites formed by the nutsedge species were more polar than 14C-CGA-362622 and averaged 69 and 61% of the radioactivity in purple and yellow nutsedge. The half-life of CGA-362622 was estimated at 4 h in both purple and yellow nutsedge.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-18</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020310-225606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE COGNITIVE REPRESENTATION OF STRESSFUL MEMORIES</field><field name="creator">Boals, Adriel</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; The purpose of the present study was to explore differences in the cognitive representation of stressful memories versus less stressful memories. Five hundred-fifty six participants indicated whether they were currently involved in a significant romantic relationship, had experienced the breakup of a relationship in the last 12 months, or had not been involved in a relationship in the last 12 months. To compare stressful memories to less stressful memories, participants who experienced a breakup rated how stressful the breakup was for them (past distress). Ninety-one participants who had experienced a breakup reported low distress about the breakup; 117 reported high distress. Three hundred-forty eight participants who had not experienced the breakup of a significant romantic relationship in the last 12 months were included in the study as comparison groups. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique was used to measure the cognitive representations of participants? memories using 6 behaviors and 6 emotions associated with romantic relationships. In addition, participants completed a measure of intrusive thoughts about the relationship and wrote a brief essay describing their deepest thoughts and feelings about their past relationship and the subsequent breakup. Results indicated that the cognitive representations of participants in the low stress breakup group were more clustered than those in the high stress breakup group . Post-hoc analysis of current distress over the breakup found that participants who were less able to accept the breakup rated the emotions and the behaviors associated with the relationship more similarly, had more aberrant cognitive representations of the relationship, had more intrusive thoughts about the breakup, and evidenced a greater use of cause and insight words when asked to describe their past relationship. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive theories of the structure of stressful memories and clinical theories of recovering from a stressful experience.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-14</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020314-162234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of NaCl, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Lactose and pH on the Foaming Properties of Whey Proteins</field><field name="creator">Davis, Jack Parker</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Common and important cosolutes of whey proteins include NaCl, CaCl and NaCl at pH 3.0 and 7.0.

At pH 3.0, neither salt at any concentration significantly affected yield stress; however, overrun was generally higher at pH 3.0 as compared to pH 7.0. The relationship between overrun and surface tension with yield stress as predicted by a previously described theoretical model did not hold for this data.

The electron energy distribution featured kinetic energies higher than that of completely thermalized electrons. Transport through films thicker than 95 nm and applied field between 200 kV/cm - 350 kV/cm occurred as steady-state hot electron transport represented by a Fermi-Dirac/ Maxwellian energy distribution. At higher fields (470 kV/cm), intervalley scattering was evidenced by a second peak corresponding to the first satellite valley in AlN. Transport through 80 nm thick layers revealed the onset of quasi-ballistic transport.&amp;#13 &amp;#09 From these measurements, saturation velocities between 1.2 and 1.5x10 cm/s and a mean free path of 5.1 nm were determined under steady state conditions. Overshoots as high as five times the saturation velocity were observed and a transient length of less than 80 nm was deduced.&amp;#13 &amp;#09 Two field-emission states of single-walled carbon nanotubes were identified. The state yielding 10 times increased emission current was attributed to the presence of adsorbates on the nanotubes as confirmed by electron emission measurements at different background pressures. In the high current state, field-emitted electrons originated from states located up to 1 eV below the Fermi level, as determined by field-emission energy distribution measurements. This suggested that adsorbates introduced a resonant state on the surface which enhanced the tunneling probability of electrons. The adsorbed states were removed at high applied electric fields, presumably due to ohmic heating caused by large emission currents. This adsorption/desorption process was completely reversible.&amp;#13 &amp;#09 Using the Duke and Alferieff model, and a one-dimensional Fowler-Nordheim scheme, we demonstrated that adsorption enhances the field emission from single-walled carbon nanotubes through elastic resonance tunneling. As anticipated from this model, we observed FEED peak shifts towards lower energies and a symmetric peak shape in the energy distribution. The difference between the work function and the electronic binding energy of the non-perturbed state involved in the resonance was 0.3 eV ?&#177; 0.2 eV, thus the state lied close to the Fermi level of the carbon nanotubes. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-28</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Material Science and Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020321-110450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conferencing Software: Why to Incorporate It into Writing Instruction and How to Select an Appropriate Product</field><field name="creator">Fiore, Sallie Mae</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;With existing technological capabilities, writing instructors are confronted with many choices regarding the facilitation of their instruction.

This study was designed to provide some guidance for instructors trying to determine if and how to use conferencing software to enhance their instruction. It reviews the educational theories that promote conversation and support community building in writing instruction and examines how CMC can support these theories. To examine the options available to writing instructors wishing to incorporate CMC in their classroom, it compares seven existing conferencing software applications. This comparison attempts to help instructors, who want to foster conversation, involvement, and a student-centered pedagogy, gain insight into available products.

The Oxford and Cambridge models offered residential settings where students and faculty lived, ate, and studied together (Rowe, 1981). The living-learning residential model emerged from the present day American university?s desire to practice learning as a part of living. &lt;p&gt; The Educational Resources Information Center defines living-learning programs as "Residential facilities of higher education institutions designed to enhance students ' educational experiences by enabling them to integrate their academic activities with their ordinary living activities "(ERIC, 1982, p. 143). Riker (1965) and Rowe (1981) created eight components that give living-learning program administrators a broad based foundation on which to build living-learning program curricula.&lt;p&gt; Twenty living-learning program administrators listed how their programs incorporate Riker (1965) and Rowe's (1981) components and then prioritized the curricula on these lists. A three round Delphi surveying technique was used to structure this process. In the first round of the process administrators generated lists of program curricula that exist at established programs across the country. Rounds two and three of the process were a tool for building consensus on the most heavily valued living-learning program curricula. &lt;p&gt; Results indicate that curricula providing opportunities for students to pursue an academic life style were most valued by the group of twenty administrators.

We proceed fromthe most general case to the very specific problem area of sparse optimal control.In the first most general approach, we assume only that the coefficient matrix isnonsingular. We target highly indefinite, nonsymmetric problems that cause difficultiesfor preconditioned iterative solvers, and where standard preconditioners, likeincomplete factorizations, often fail. We experiment with nonsymmetric permutationsand scalings aimed at placing large entries on the diagonal in the context of preconditioningfor general sparse matrices. Our numerical experiments indicate that thereliability and performance of preconditioned iterative solvers are greatly enhancedby such preprocessing.Secondly, we present two new preconditioners for KKT systems. KKT systemsarise in areas such as quadratic programming, sparse optimal control, and mixedfinite element formulations. Our preconditioners approximate a constraint preconditionerwith incomplete factorizations for the normal equations. Numerical experimentscompare these two preconditioners with exact constraint preconditioning andthe approach described above of permuting large entries to the diagonal.Finally, we turn to a specific problem area: sparse optimal control. Many optimalcontrol problems are broken into several phases, and within a phase, mostvariables and constraints depend only on nearby variables and constraints. However,free initial and final times and time-independent parameters impact variables andconstraints throughout a phase, resulting in dense factored blocks in the KKT matrix.We drop fill due to these variables to reduce density within each phase. Theresulting preconditioner is tightly banded and nearly block tri-diagonal. Numericalexperiments demonstrate that the preconditioners are effective, with very little fill inthe factorization.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Applied Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020323-195621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of bigmouth sleepers (Eleotridae: Gobiomorus dormitor)in a Puerto Rico reservoir</field><field name="creator">Bacheler, Nathan Mitchell</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The bigmouth sleeper Gobiomorus dormitor is an eleotrid species found in southernFlorida and Texas, along the Atlantic coast of Central and South America, and theCaribbean Islands. This species is important in terms of recreational and consumptivefishing, and conservation. Bigmouth sleepers are harvested by anglers in parts of their range, while in Florida hydrological changes, habitat loss, and reduced waterquality have reduced the species? already small geographical distribution,necessitating conservation measures. There is a paucity of data regarding the biologyof bigmouth sleepers, but accurate knowledge of this species? ecology and behavioris crucial to effective conservation and management plans. Although bigmouth sleeperstypically inhabit lotic habitats, they have been found in four reservoirs in PuertoRico. In Carite Reservoir, abundance and size data indicate that habitat is suitablehabitat for bigmouth sleepers, and the presence of a diversity of size classes ofsleepers suggests that either in-reservoir reproduction or significant recruitmentto the reservoir from an outside source is occurring. This research was initiatedto evaluate the likelihood of each, and to learn more broadly about bigmouth sleeperecology. Population biology, diet, and reproduction of bigmouth sleepers in CariteReservoir were examined between 1999 and 2001. Many sizes of bigmouth sleepers werecollected during this study, ranging from 25 to 400 mm TL. The estimated totalpopulation size in 2000 and 2001 was 1,783 and 3,353 fish, respectively. Daily growthrate of tagged fish ranged from ?0.08 to 0.10 mm/day, and was negatively correlatedwith length of fish at marking. Diet of small bigmouth sleepers (50 ? 100 mm TL) mainlyconsisted of insects, whereas larger fish primarily preyed upon fish and freshwatercrabs. Sexual dimorphism of bigmouth sleepers was evident in the anatomy of theirurogenital papillae; these differences developed at sizes as small as 50 mm TL and persisted throughout the year. Reproduction was seasonal, with the highest gonadosomaticindicies occurring in May and June and the lowest in January and February. The smallestmature male observed was 159 mm TL, while the smallest mature female was 179 mm TL. Size frequency distributions of oocytes in female ovaries during the reproductiveseason typically fell into two size groups, a group of primary oocytes (&lt; 0.20 mm)and one group of maturing oocytes (&gt; 0.20 mm). The largest oocytes observed were 0.70mm from a 270-mm female. Fecundity was negatively correlated with date, suggestingbatch spawning. Fecundity was relatively high (mean = 140,836) and was positively correlated with female body weight. Results of this research not only provide managersand conservationists a better understanding of bigmouth sleepers in Puerto Rico reservoirs, but also contribute to the knowledge of this species? ecology throughoutits range.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020325-124802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EXAMINING LANDOWNER ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR TOWARDS WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT ON PRIVATE LAND IN NORTH CAROLINA</field><field name="creator">Daley, Salinda Siobhan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In the United States, where private land predominates, most conservation and management efforts have focused on publicly owned land, likely due to conflicting traditions of private property rights, public ownership of wildlife, and state regulation of wildlife. At present, property rights are increasingly juxtaposed with stewardship responsibilities and there is increasing pressure to blend public and private land management. In the southeastern United States, early successional habitats have declined considerably in recent years, amidst rising growth and development rates. In accordance with the recognition of declining wildlife populations associated with early successional habitat and the need for influence over habitat on private land, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission established the Cooperative Upland Habitat and Enhancement (CURE) Program in August 2000. The program targets private landowners in three select regions of the state (Upper Coastal Plain I, Upper Coastal Plain II, Western Piedmont). Human dimensions survey research was conducted in the three CURE Programming areas in order to: 1) validate either a regional or statewide approach to promoting and implementing the CURE Program; and 2) recommend pertinent programming changes relative to the suggested approach. Survey results confirmed previous research conducted on private landowner attitudes and behavior regarding wildlife, which suggested differences in population subsets warrant tailored approaches to wildlife programming. Regional differences were found among the majority of variables examined in the survey. Regional differences were most pronounced across area (rural vs. urban), occupational (production vs. non production land), income, and land-use variables. Though Coastal Plain landowners did not express as much support for wildlife values or responsibility wildlife as Western Piedmont landowners did, they appeared more likely to participate in CURE Programming, due to familiarity with incentives-based agency programs. Notwithstanding regional variability, the typical landowner who is actively managing for wildlife is a male who is involved in land production, and who lives on or very near to his property. Programming efforts must be geared toward the varied land-use and occupational characteristics of the CURE Program regions. While a 'top-down' approach (offering specific enhancement practices coupled with economic incentives) will be most cost effective in the Coastal Plain, wildlife programming in the Western Piedmont region will likely require a 'bottom-up' approach of soliciting individual or small groups of landowners to work with the NCWRC in a highly cooperative and personalized manner. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fisheries and Wildlife Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020325-125914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Morphological Basis for Reproductive Sensitivity to Glyphosate in Glyphosate-Resistant Cotton.</field><field name="creator">Pline, Wendy</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Transgenic, glyphosate-resistant (GR) cotton has been available to U.S. growers since 1997. Despitewide-spread acceptance, there have been performance complaints by growers citing lower boll retention in GRvarieties than in conventional varieties. Field and greenhouse studies confirmed grower observations,demonstrating a glyphosate-associated decrease in boll retention compared to non-treated GR or conventionalplants. Late (beyond the 5 leaf stage) foliar applications were the most injurious, presumably because plantswere entering early reproductive stages. Boll ?cavitation,? (dessicated bolls attached to plants) also observed bygrowers following glyphosate treatment, resulted from abnormal abscission zone formation and was related tovariety.&lt;p&gt;14C-glyphosate absorption per square centimeter was greater when applied to stem tissue than leaf tissue, but overallabsorption is likely greater when applied foliarly, due to a greater total surface area. Because glyphosatetypically moves from source tissue to sink tissue, up to 3.7% of applied 14C-glyphosate was translocated toreproductive tissues.&lt;p&gt;Seedling development in both GR and conventional cotton was inhibited by root-absorbed glyphosate.Root tissues were more sensitive to glyphosate than cotyledons or hypocotyls, as was demonstrated byinhibition of lateral root formation and shikimic acid accumulation. CP4-EPSPS content was significantly lowerin GR seedling roots than cotyledons, accounting for glyphosate sensitivity.&lt;p&gt;Further studies compared the accumulation of shikimic acid in response to glyphosate in reproductiveand vegetative tissues in GR and conventional cotton. Shikimic acid accumulation per mM of glyphosate, wasgreater in reproductive than vegetative leaf tissue in both GR and conventional cotton, suggesting thatreproductive tissue is innately more sensitive to glyphosate than vegetative tissue. The quantity of theglyphosate-resistant CP4-EPSPS enzyme was significantly less in stamens than in vegetative leaf tissues.Several morphological differences were apparent in flowers of glyphosate-treated GR cotton.&lt;p&gt;Glyphosate applications inhibited stamen elongation, resulting in anthers not extending to the tip of the stigma,thereby limiting pollen deposition to the lower, less receptive portion of the stigma. Total pollen deposition on the stigma was less in glyphosate-treated GR cotton than non-treated GR or conventional cotton. Microscopicanalysis of pollen revealed that glyphosate arrested maturation in at least 3 pollen developmental stages. Atanthesis, pollen grains from glyphosate-treated GR plants were collapsed, highly vacuolated, and had 60% lowerviability (ability to germinate) than pollen from non-treated GR or conventional plants. Retained bolls fromglyphosate-treated plants had fewer seeds than those from non-treated GR or conventional plants. Hand crossesbetween glyphosate-treated plants demonstrated that the number of seeds per boll was decreased when the maleparent, but not the female parent, was glyphosate treated. Hand pollinations using pollen from treated plants,although overcoming the increased anther-stigma distance, did not restore the normal number of seeds per boll.Treatment of GA onto glyphosate-treated GR plants did not remediate glyphosate effects on pollen viability andfloral morphology. Therefore, presumably, several of the bolls that were shed due to glyphosate-treatments,contained an insufficient number of fertilized ovules and are thus shed.&lt;p&gt;This research proposes that boll shed due to glyphosate in GR cotton is due to insufficient levels ofCP4-EPSPS in stamens, which are highly sensitive to glyphosate. As glyphosate accumulates in reproductivestructures, stamen elongation and pollen development are inhibited, resulting in poor fertilization of ovules.Because fewer ovules are fertilized, bolls are either shed or contain fewer seeds if retained. Growers shouldlimit glyphosate contact with GR cotton, especially during the reproductive stages in order to minimize thepotential for glyphosate-induced boll shed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-25</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020325-131845</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A numerical modeling study of the hydrodynamics of the Croatan-Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System, North Carolina</field><field name="creator">Peng, Machuan</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;PENG, MACHUAN. A numerical modeling study of the hydrodynamics of the Croatan-Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System, North Carolina. (Under the direction of Lian Xieand Frederick Bingham)Numerical studies in the Croatan-Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary System (CAPES),are urgently needed for water quality control, environment protection and disastermitigation. In this study, a three-dimensional primitive equation hydrostatic model withhigh horizontal resolution is configured for the CAPES and its adjacent shelf toinvestigate barotropic/baroclinic wind driven circulation and sea level changes, riverdischarge induced flow, barotropic M2 tide, tidal current and tide-residual current. A newinundation/drying scheme is developed to allow the water-land boundary in the model tomove for simulating hurricane-induced coastal flooding and drying. This inundationalgorithm is based on the sea surface height relative to the adjacent topography, as well asthe distance traveled by the coastal interface, which is determined by the current speedimmediately seaward of the sea-land boundary.The main conclusions of this study are summarized below: (1) The verticalstructure of the wind driven circulation is more complicated in the coastal regions than inthe open area. On the open sea it follows a frictional Ekman equilibrium. (2) Thebaroclinic wind-driven current in the CAPES is over 40 cm/s in some regions due to greatvariations of the salinity distribution. (3) Stream flow nudging is a better method forspecifying the flux boundary condition near a river mouth than the barotropic-flowmethod in simulating river discharge induced flow. In annual mean case, such flow canbe ignored for its contribution to the coastal circulation, however, it could not be ignoredin flood cases. (4) M2 tide is much higher near the coast than inside the CAPES, but M2tidal currents in some regions inside Pamlico Sound can be greater than outside. Therelatively small M2 tide-induced residual current is stable and may have potential effectson long-term cross shelf transport. (5) Mass conservation must be considered in a closedor near closed estuary region when the inundation process is studied, and surface ratherthan vertically averaged current speed should be taken as the inundation speed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020325-142922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of Cylindrical Wire Electrical Discharge Machining Process and Investigation of Surface Integrity and Mechanical Property of EDM Surface Layers.</field><field name="creator">Qu, Jun</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The cylindrical wire Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) process was developed to generate precise cylindrical forms on hard, difficult-to-machine materials. A precise, flexible, and corrosion-resistant underwater rotary spindle was designed and added to a conventional two-axis wire EDM machine to enable the generation of free-form cylindrical geometries. A detailed spindle error analysis identified the major source of error at different frequencies. The mathematical models for material removal rate and surface finish were derived. Experimental results indicated that higher maximum material removal rate might be achieved in the cylindrical wire EDM than the 2D wire EDM. Effects of some key process parameters, wire feed rate, pulse on-time and part rotational speed, on the surface finish and roundness are explored. For WC-Co parts, an arithmetic average surface roughness and roundness as low as 0.68 and 1.7 mm, respectively, can be achieved. Surfaces of the cylindrical EDM parts were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to identify the macro-ridges and craters on the surface. Cross-sections of the EDM parts are examined using the SEM to quantify the recast layer and heat-affected zone under various process parameters. This study also used nanoindentation to investigate the influence of cylindrical wire EDM process on the mechanical properties of WC-Co composite. Multiple indents were conducted on the cross-section of the recast layer, heat-affected zone, and bulk material. The SEM micrographs were used to correlate the individual nano-indent to the measured hardness and modulus of elasticity. The experimental results showed that the heat-affected zone had more compact microstructure less indentation cracking. The recast layer had lower hardness and modulus of elasticity than the original material and heat-affected zone. EDS X-ray and X-ray diffraction were used to analyze the material compositions of the heat-affected zone and recast layer and to understand the effects of wire EDM process on the machined WC-Co surface. The micro-blasting process has been applied to improve the surface integrity of the part machined by wire EDM. The surface roughness of WC-Co parts could be reduced significantly using micro-size SiC abrasives. The surface finish improvement was also shown by the SEM micrographs of the blasted surfaces and their cross-sections. The undesired recast layer, which has poor mechanical properties and irregular features, was eventually removed by micro-blasting. Compressive residual stress introduced by micro-blasting could increase the surface wear resistance. Experiments with different process parameters were conduced to study the efficiency and effectiveness of micro-blasting for surface property control. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020325-173441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preconditioning for Stochastic Automata Networks</field><field name="creator">Langville, Amy N.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Many very large Markov chains can be modeled efficiently as Stochastic Automata Networks (SANs). A SAN iscomposed of individual automata that, for the most part, act independently, requiring only infrequentinteraction. SANs represent the generator matrix Q of the underlying Markov chain compactly as the sum ofKronecker products of smaller matrices. Thus, storage savings are immediate. The benefit of a SAN's compactrepresentation, known as the descriptor, is often outweighed by its tendency to make analysis of theunderlying Markov chain tough. Although iterative or projection methods have been used to solve the system P Q=0, the convergence to the stationary solution P is still unsatisfactory. SAN's compact representation hasmade the next logical research step of preconditioning thorny. Several preconditioners for SANs have beenproposed and tested, yet each has enjoyed little or no success. Encouraged by the recent success ofapproximate inverses as preconditioners, we have explored their potential as SAN preconditioners. Onepromising finding on approximate inverse preconditioner is the nearest Kronecker product (NKP) approximationintroduced by Pitsianis and Van Loan. In this dissertation, we approximate Q by the nearest Kronecker productfor a SAN with a Kronecker product, A1 D A2 D . . . D AN. Then, we take M= A1-1 A2-1 D . . . D AN-1 as ourSAN NKP preconditioner. We show how successful this NKP preconditioner is for SANs by testing it on severalexamples. We also introduce and catalogue some new results about the Kronecker product, an operation which isfundamental to this SAN research.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-01</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operations Research</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020326-002140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributed Resource Monitoring Tool and its Use in Security and Quality of Service Evaluation</field><field name="creator">Goff, Brian David</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt;As networks become increasingly more open and complex, their management becomes that much more important. Numerous commercial and open-source tools already exist that are capable of providing useful network analysis. Unfortunately, the majority of these commercial tools are either quite expensive, or require a significant amount of effort for their deployment. Other tools are very specific in their tasks, and offer little in the way of customization. Tools able to provide favorable statistics often fall short when it comes to operating on loaded high-bandwidth networks. Also, as the majority of network management tools operate at the packet level, they often require administrator-level access to capture the data. In addition, there are privacy issues that may also limit who has access to what part of the data. On large networks, this can amount to a lot of data that needs to be scrutinized by a limited number of people.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The purpose of this project was to develop an inexpensive, customizable network-monitoring tool (called Resource Usage Monitor) that a) is capable of providing a variety of traffic-related statistical data on a high-bandwidth network, b) provides a user-friendly selective access to that data for users with different privacy privileges, and c) interfaces to a policy management toolset to allow pro-active management of the network based on security, quality and resource information it gathers. The processing engine behind the Resource Usage Monitor (RUM) examines data at the monitored gateway, collecting inbound and outbound information on the number of bytes, packets, network and application flows, and such, transmitted or received for each internal and external host. A web interface provides persistence graphs and reports that can disclose general and specific traffic patterns on the network. This information can be used to assess security, resource usage, and quality of service (QoS) assessment of the monitored network and hosts. For example, setting flow, load, and other activity thresholds at different levels of granularity allows for the detection of anomalies throughout the network. Port scans, Denial of Service (DOS) attacks, and Trojan applications have been detected through surveillance of simple threshold-based patterns. More complex, possibly multi-probe, patterns can reveal much more subtle anomalies and side effects.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;RUM operates in a statistical mode, rather than continuous mode. It samples the network every few minutes. After each sample the collected data is analyzed and appropriate warnings and interactions with the policy services are effected. Collected packets are sorted and stored by pre-defined subnets allowing parallelism in the processing of the data. This also separates datasets for another reason; it enables secure access to just the network traffic for which an administrator is responsible. Persistence data is kept in the form of graphs generated using RRDtool, a round robin database utility, and in logs. The information logged is completely customizable and can even be offloaded for analysis by other systems. This thesis describes the RUM architecture, data it collects, analysis modules, user handling, and other features.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020326-094110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge Management Through Pair Programming</field><field name="creator">Palmieri, David Walsh</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Knowledge Management has been the subject of increasing focus over the last several years. Literature and research on the topic has grown as companies and organizations have come to realize that success is often determined by one's ability to create, disseminate, and embody knowledge in products and services. This realization has led to increased interest in examining the ways in which knowledge can be effectively created, identified, codified, disseminated, and retained. The field of Knowledge Management has emerged to address this need.&lt;p&gt;One of the obstacles that Knowledge Management seeks to overcome is the natural tendency in people to hoard knowledge. People often withhold knowledge when they feel it provides them with a competitive advantage over others. Many traditional management incentives and team structures create and perpetuate competitive environments that encourage knowledge hoarding. Knowledge Management also seeks to find ways to reduce the impact of employee turnover. When an employee leaves a company or organization, the knowledge they possess often goes with them. This loss can potentially have a negative impact on the productivity and quality of the company or organization. Knowledge Management seeks to find ways to minimize loss of knowledge when an employee leaves a company or organization.&lt;p&gt;Pair programming is a practice that holds promise for overcoming some of the challenges faced by Knowledge Management. In pair programming, two programmers work side-by-side at one computer collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or test. The continual interaction between pair programmers would seem to provide an environment that promotes knowledge sharing, and collaborative knowledge discovery. Additionally, through pair rotation, in which pairs change partners fairly often, tacit knowledge might be spread more effectively through face-to-face communication than by documentation, databases, or other means.&lt;p&gt;This research examines pair programming in the realm of Knowledge Management, positing the following hypotheses:Pair programming reduces the tendency of people to hoard knowledge.Pair programming reduces the impact of employee turnover.Pair programming is an effective means of knowledge dissemination and knowledge retention that has a positive influence on the Knowledge Management practices of a company or organization.&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These hypotheses are tested through the use of a survey of individuals in technology research, development, and service. Analysis of the survey results provided no conclusive evidence to either support or disprove the hypothesis that pair programming reduces the tendency of people to hoard knowledge. The results indicate support for the hypothesis that pair programming reduces the impact of employee turnover, although not statistically significant. And finally, the survey results indicate with statistical significance that pair programming is an effective means of knowledge dissemination and retention, with a positive influence on the Knowledge Management practices of a company or organization. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020328-093026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstraction-Based Generation of Finite State Models from C Programs.</field><field name="creator">DuVarney, Daniel C.</field><field name="description">by&lt;p&gt;Daniel C.

Unfortunately, applying model-checking techniques to software systems has proved to be more difficult, due to the large number of states and irregular transitions of such systems. One promising method for generating reasonably-sized models from programs is the use of data abstraction, in which the program data is mapped from a large set of possible values to a much smaller set of abstract values. This thesis develops a method which, given a program in the C language and an abstraction mapping, allows the automatic construction of an abstract labeled transition system (LTS), which is much smaller than the concrete LTS (the LTS which would be generated without the benefit of abstraction). The method is shown to be sound in the sense that if a program is well-behaved in its use of pointers, then any linear temporal logic formula which holds true for the corresponding abstract LTS will also hold true for the concrete LTS. Furthermore, if a design exists in the form of a transition system, then the abstract LTS can be checked against the design for bisimilarity. Bisimilarity ensures that the program is a faithful implementation ofthe design. A suite of software tools has been implemented based upon the theory. These tools interface with the Concurrency Workbench, a model checking system. A case study is presented which shows the practicality of this technique for verifying real-world C programs.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-03-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Science</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020328-101420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PREDICTING RETENTION OF RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING: IMPLICATIONS FOR STATES ANDORGANIZATIONAL RECRUITING PRACTICES</field><field name="creator">Tarant, Stephanie Ann</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Today's labor force is more mobile than any cohort in recent history. Labor force mobility and state level retention can have profound effects on the economy of a state. It is necessary for organizations to both effectively retain their own talent as well as to attract top talent from other states. Understanding the individual level factors that predict who will move and who will stay in-state after graduating from college is important for policy makers and organizations looking to tailor their recruiting efforts in order to maximize their efforts to attract and retain top talent in science and engineering fields. The present study examined data collected by the National Science Foundation in their National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG:1997) to determine factors that predict state retention of high school and most recent college degree recipients in science and engineering fields. Logistic regression was used to analyze two dichotomous dependent measures of retention, high school degree and most recent college degree. Results found support for a core set of predictors common to both measures; they include race, college major, annual salary, and stayers (those who stayed in-state to attend college). In addition, undergraduate GPA predicted retention at the high school level while respondent age and citizenship predicted retention/ most recent degree. By far, stayers had the largest effect on retention for both dependent measures.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-02</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020401-183759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mock Jurors' Ratings of Mitigating Value in Capital Mitigation: Role of Impairment and Defendant Effort</field><field name="creator">Weeks, Stephanie Wright</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Applying attribution theory to capital sentencing decisions, it was hypothesized that temporal location of mitigation (suggesting defendant impairment) and level of defendant effort would affect mock jurors' ratings of mitigating value and subsequent life v. death votes. This was tested experimentally in a 2 (type of mitigation: proximal v. remote-chronic) x 2 (defendant effort: high v. low) design with 240 university psychology students. Two sentencing scenarios were nested within each level of type of mitigation. Thus, participants received one of eight sentencing scenarios. Participants rated the evidence on a variety of dimensions, including perceived defendant impairment, effort and responsibility. They also assigned mitigating value to the circumstances presented in the scenarios and indicated a final penalty vote (life in prison or death). Multivariate analysis of variance results indicated that outcomes were affected by whether the mitigation had a recent or distant onset, but they were not affected by the level of defendant effort. The mitigating value rating was a significant predictor of the vote for life, as more mitigating value was associated with an increased likelihood of voting for life. Supplementary analyses indicated that perceived impairment was a significant mediator of the relationship between mitigating value and the vote for life. When controlling for perceptions of impairment, the predictive power of mitigating value was diminished. These results support previous qualitative and exploratory experimental research concerning the efficacy of capital mitigation. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020402-151255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tradable Reservations In Multi-Agent, Resource-Constrained Environments</field><field name="creator">Prado-Lozko, Jorge E.</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;People waste a lot of time waiting in queues.

Each SF soldiers performance was examined with a three dimension conceptual model ( i.e. soldiering skills, Special Forces specific skills, and team member skills). This model was tested on two different samples. The first sample was made up of 1,273 U.S. Army Special Forces Soldiers who were rated by officers. The second sample was comprised of 1,121 U.S. Army Special Forces Soldiers who were rated by noncommissioned officers. This study found that the three dimensions of performance were highly intercorrelated with the highest correlation being between the soldiering skills and SF specific dimensions. In addition to correlation analysis, several regression models were also used to analyze each of the three dimensions. A full model was used to regress each of the nine sub-dimensions with the three dimensions of performance. Three reduced models were also made by regressing three sub-dimensions with each of the three dimensions of performance. It was found that each dimension used significantly different regression models. As well, the three reduced models were found to be significant in explaining each dimension. However, the reduced models were unable to explain a significant amount of variance when compared to the full model. Additionally, this study concluded that including all the items (positive, neutral, negative) improved each dimensional model?s multiple correlation coefficient, but only marginally. &lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-03</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020402-212542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric Key Distribution</field><field name="creator">Sonalker, Anuja Anilkumar</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt; ABSTRACT BY Anuja A Sonalker on Asymmetric Key Distribution. (Under the direction of Dr. Gregory T. Byrd) Currently, in Threshold Public Key Systems key shares are generated uniformly and distributed in the same manner to every participant. We propose a new scheme, Asymmetric Key Distribution (AKD), in which one share server is provided with a larger, unequal chunk of the original secret key. Asymmetric Key Distribution is a unique scheme for generating and distributing unequal shares via a Trusted Dealer to all the registered peers in the system such that without the combination of the single compulsory share from the Special Server no transaction can be completed. This application is aimed for circumstances where a single party needs to co-exist within a group of semi-trusted peers, or in a coalition where every entity should have a choice to participate and one of the entities needs to be privileged with more powers. This thesis presents the algorithm and security model for Asymmetric Key Distribution, along with all the assumptions and dependencies within the boundaries of which this algorithm is guaranteed to be secure. Its robustness lies in its simplicity and in its distributed nature. We address all security concerns related to the model including compromised share servers and cryptanalytic attacks. A variation, called the Dual Threshold Scheme, is created to reduce the vulnerability in the algorithm, namely, the compromise of the Special Server and its secret share. In this scheme, a combination of another threshold number of Distributed Special Servers must combine to collectively generate a share equivalent to the Special Server?s share. This flexibility allows us to adjust our threshold scheme for the environment. We describe a Java-based implementation of the AKD algorithm, using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) for communication among share servers. A typical scenario of a Trusted Dealer, a Special Server and a number of Share Servers was created, where timed asymmetric key generation and distribution was carried out after which the servers initiated and carried out certificate signing transactions in the appropriated manner. As an interesting exercise, the share servers were corrupted so that they would try to exclude the Special Server in the transactions and try to form its share themselves, to observe the consequence. All their efforts were futile. Another interesting aspect was the key generation timing. Key generation is known to be a very time-extensive process but the key share reuse concept used in this implementation reduced the time for key generation by 66-90% of the classical key generation time.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020403-040240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic Global Optimization Techniques</field><field name="creator">Birbil, Sevket Ilker</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;In this research, a novel population-based global optimization method has been studied. The method is called Electromagnetism-like Mechanism or in short EM. The proposed method mimicks the behavior of electrically charged particles. In other words, a set of points is sampled from the feasible region and these points imitate the role of the charged particles in basic electromagnetism. The underlying idea of the method is directing sample points toward local optimizers, which point out attractive regions of the feasible space.The proposed method has been applied to different test problems from the literature. Moreover, the viability of the method has been tested by comparing its results with other reported results from the literature. Without using the higher order information, EM has converged rapidly (in terms of the number of function evaluations) to the global optimum and produced highly efficient results for problems of varying degree of difficulty.After a systematic study of the underlying stochastic process, the proof of convergence to the global optimum has been given for the proposed method. The thrust of the proof has been to show that in the limit, at least one of the points in the population moves to the neighborhood of the global optimum with probability one.The structure of the proposed method is very flexible permitting the easy development of variations. Capitalizing on this, several variants of the proposed method has been developed and compared with the other methods from the literature. These variants of EM have been able to provide accurate answers to selected problems and in many cases have been able to outperform other well-known methods.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-04</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Industrial Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020403-171452</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of cis-acting elements of NtPMT3 and trans-acting factors of NtQPT1 in Nicotiana tabacum</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Xinxin</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;&lt;P&gt; The primary focus of this thesis is the study of the regulation of NtPMT3 and NtQPT1 gene expression. Their spatial and temporal expression has been demonstrated to be regulated coordinately. In this work, a 2.05kb of 5' flanking region of NtPMT3 has been cloned from N. tabacum. Then a series of nested 5'-deletion of the NtPMT3 promoter driving a GUS reporter gene were generated. The chimeric reporter gene constructs, as well as a 35S CaMV promoter::GUS were introduced into tobacco N. tabacum cv. D-174 using Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation. Several independent transgenic lines for each construct were regenerated. Samples of leaf, stem and root were collected from different transformants and GUS activities were quantified by fluorometric assays. These deletion analyses showed that 320 base pairs from the site of transcription initiation is sufficient to direct its root-specific expression. A negative regulatory element that suppressed expression of the reporter gene in roots is located between -2.048kb to -1.632kb 5' of the transcription initiation site. In this 417bp region, six Auxin Response Elements (AuxREs) or AuxRE-like elements were found. Auxin is known to down regulate PMT transcription and this part of sequence might play an important role in its auxin response. Sequential deletion analyses also defined three positive regulatory elements, -1631bp to -1335bp, -601bp to -318bp and -317bp to -116bp. Deletion of these regions resulted in a decrease in their GUS expression. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt; Previous studies of the NtQPT1 have identified a Nic gene response element located between -731bp and -1056bp from the transcription initiation site. To isolate the trans-acting factors binding to this sequence, I screened a tobacco root lambda-gt11 cDNA expression library. I obtained 5 cDNA clones encoding three different proteins that bind to the target sequence. DNA sequence of one protein (~790bp) shows high homology to N. tabacum DNA-binding protein of HMG protein family gene (ID AF002226). DNA sequence of the second protein (550bp) is about 99% identical to an A. thaliana small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-like protein gene (ID AY042797). Two cDNAs encoding the third protein are about 2.3kb. 500bp of both 3' and 5' ends were sequenced and showed high homology to a putative jasmonate inducible gene of A. thaliana (ID AY035108). The homology of 3' untranslated region indicates that the N. tabacum root expression library was contaminated by Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020404-142031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Regional Accommodation of African American English: Evidence from a Bi-Ethnic Mountain Enclave Community</field><field name="creator">Mallinson, Christine</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Recent studies of bi-ethnic enclave communities in coastal North Carolina (e.g., Wolfram, Thomas, and Green 2000) suggest that earlier African American speech both accommodated localized dialect norms and also exhibited a persistent substratal effect from the early African-European contact situation. To determine if such situations were the norm or an anomaly, this study examines Beech Bottom, North Carolina, a long-term, bi-ethnic enclave mountain community. In the early 1900s, Beech Bottom?s population ranged from 80 to 110 residents, but community size dwindled with the decline of feldspar mining. Currently, about ten longtime residents live in Beech Bottom: three are European Americans and the rest are designated as ?African Americans? in the historical bi-racial taxonomy of the American South, although they are actually of mixed descent.This study specifically examines dialect accommodation for the Beech Bottom African American speakers. To what extent do they share the local Appalachian dialect with cohort European Americans, and what does this reflect about the status of earlier African American English? Is there a contemporary ethnolinguistic divide, and if so, how is it manifested? To answer these questions, a representative set of diagnostic phonological (e.g., postvocalic r-lessness, /aI/ ungliding) and morphosyntactic (e.g., 3rd pl. ?s attachment, 3rd sg. ?s absence) variables for a sample of current residents is considered. The analysis supports the conclusion that earlier African American speech accommodated to local dialect norms, and it suggests that there has been subtle but persistent substrate influence in the historical development of AAVE.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-09</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020404-142159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship between Soil Fertility and the Forests of the Southern Appalachian Region</field><field name="creator">Ulrey, Christopher Joseph</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;This study examines the distribution of plant communities across the Southern Appalachian region and seeks to understand the role that soil fertility plays in the complex pattern of vegetation that exists in this landscape. A regional dataset consisting of 1,273 sample plots was used to explore patterns of species composition. A total of 6 vegetation classes and 19 plant communities were classified from this dataset. The correlation of environmental variables with Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordinations indicated three major environmental gradients, elevation (a surrogate for temperature ), topographic landform (a surrogate for moisture), and soil fertility (base cations). The regional dataset was subset to mesophytic plant communities (Acidic Cove Forests, Rich Cove Forests, and Mesic Montane Oak-Hickory Forests) that represent narrow segments of the elevation and topographic landform gradients. Variables associated with soil fertility were highly correlated with the NMDS ordination of this reduced dataset. Finally, Acidic Cove Forests and Rich Cove Forests were examined separately. Soil fertility variables continued to be important correlates with patterns of species composition within Acidic Cove Forests. The Rich Cove Forests also exhibited a strong relationship between soil fertility and species composition. In addition, much of the compositional variation in Rich Cove Forests appears to have a geographic component. Future efforts to understand the causal factors of species distribution in this region should consider soil fertility.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-10</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020406-160420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RESPONSES OF PREY TO THE PRESENCE OF PREDATORS IN A FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE WITH CORRIDORS</field><field name="creator">Brinkerhoff, Robert Jory</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Corridors have been shown to serve as movement conduits for a wide variety of species, though their effects on interspecific interactions have been largely unstudied. I designed a replicated experiment to investigate corridor-mediated prey responses to predators in a network of open habitat patches surrounded by a matrix of planted pine forest. I used mark-recapture studies and foraging trays to monitor the movements and behaviors of several small mammal species. The presence of predators was artificially manipulated in half of my replicates by applying bobcat urine to specific patches. I then compared the movements of small mammals and changes in foraging activity in the treated and untreated replicates, and tested how corridors affected behaviors and population sizes. I found significant differences in foraging activity between patches treated with predator urine and patches to which they were connected, whereas I found no differences in foraging activity in unconnected patches adjacent to treated patches. Movements detected by mark-recapture were too infrequent for analysis, but were proportionally consistent with previous results showing corridor effects on movement. There were no significant differences in small mammal abundances between connected and unconnected patches. These results suggest that corridors do facilitate movement between habitat patches and prey will preferentially use corridors to forage in patches with reduced predation risk. However, the corridors in this study had no apparent affect on long-term displacement of small mammals.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-12</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Zoology</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020409-163139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental Studies on the Leading Edge and Local Extinction in Lifted-Jet Diffusion Flames</field><field name="creator">Watson, Kyle Anthony</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;Several researchers have examined the concept of flame stability and there has been little agreement regarding the reasons governing this phenomenon. The experiments described within were devised to establish the dominating stabilization mechanism in lifted flames. Specifically, the flame base of lifted methane-jet diffusion flames were examined through the use of various combinations of synchronized laser-based techniques involving particle image velocimetry (PIV), planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF), and Rayleigh scattering. Results indicate the presence of a structure termed a flame. Results involving the gradient in the Rayleigh signal across the flame base, in addition to two-shot CH-PLIF interpretations support the leading-edge flame as a primary stabilization mechanism.&lt;p&gt;The extent of premixing upstream of the flame base has been a major source of disagreement in the past. The simultaneous Rayleigh and CH-PLIF images indicate the base of the lifted flame lies in a region that is within the flammability limits of methane burning in air. Furthermore, the average velocity at the stabilization point is 1.18 m/s (as determined from the simultaneous CH-PLIF and PIV investigation); this value is comparable to three times the laminar burning velocity of methane (~ 3S), thereby supporting previous numerical triple flame simulations.&lt;p&gt;Results from the joint two-shot CH-PLIF and PIV technique show that the flame base velocity is independent of the flow conditions when the flame is stationary during the time separation of the CH-PLIF pulses. Specifically, flames with Re flow conditions.&lt;p&gt;Finally, regions of local extinction ? as indicated by openings in the CH profiles ? were examined. Results from four experiments (simultaneous CH-PLIF and PIV, simultaneous CH-PLIF and OH-PLIF, simultaneous CH-PLIF and Rayleigh scattering, and simultaneous two-shot CH-PLIF and PIV) provide complementary information regarding the role of large-scale fuel vortices in initiating local flame extinction as they penetrate the reaction zone.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mechanical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020416-172342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image Integration and On-Screen Digitizing Method of Geographic Information System Update and Maintenance Applied to the Hofmann Forest</field><field name="creator">Moore, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The Hofmann Forest is a self-sustaining forest that provides the North Carolina State University College of Natural Resources with support for research, education, and extension service. The management of the Hofmann Forest requires data concerning historical records, complete and current resource inventory, and the ability to model future forest conditions. A geographic information system (GIS) database was created for the Hofmann Forest in 1992 to facilitate achievement of these data objectives. The database was not maintained or used regularly. Ongoing forestry research and silvicultural activities are constantly changing the resource conditions on the forest. This research examined a practical and accurate method for maintaining currency in the GIS database. Digital imagery was integrated into the original GIS database, and silvicultural records were used to update the existing data layers. Digital orthophotography, in the form of USGS Digital Orthophoto Quarter-Quads (DOQQs), was the primary source of imagery, but where the imagery was unavailable or contained insufficient spatial detail, unrectified aerial photographs were scanned, registered, and substituted. For the vegetation data layer of the GIS, spatial and attribute updates were completed and evaluated for silvicultural operations covering over three thousand acres. Some updates involved only changes in attributes. Spatial updates were completed with the digital orthophotography or digital aerial photographs; of these, some updates involved fairly simple spatial editing and others involved more complex spatial editing. The updates required the digital aerial photographs were all spatially complex edits. Acreage estimates accompanied the silvicultural records. GIS-derived area measurements were compared with those on the silvicultural records. There was not a significant difference between the two measures of area, however some discrepancies were present. A series of comparison tests were designed and performed to identify the potential elements of the area discrepancies. Spatial complexity of the editing procedure, different sources of digital imagery, and size of updated vegetation polygons were all examined. Degree of spatial complexity in the updates did not significantly contribute to area discrepancies. There was no significant difference in area discrepancies when either the DOQQs or digital aerial photographs were used. Size of the updated vegetation polygons was significantly negatively correlated with the discrepancies, showing that small absolute differences in area in small polygons result in large relative discrepancy values. Differentially corrected global positioning system (GPS) data were used to assess the horizontal positional accuracy of the GIS data layers. Following National Map Accuracy Standard (NMAS) guidelines, a sample of 25 ?well-defined? locations were collected using a Trimble GPS Pathfinder ProXR receiver with real-time differential correction capabilities. These same locations were identified on the Roads layer of the GIS database, the DOQQs, and the digital aerial photography. Root mean-square error (RMSE) was calculated for each of the different data layers, using the GPS data as reference locations. Only the DOQQ-derived points met the NMAS Class 2 horizontal positional accuracy standard. RMSE for the aerial photography and Roads layer were greater than the limiting RMSE for the NMSE Class 3 standard. Based on these results, it can be concluded that DOQQs possess greater horizontal accuracy than the digital aerial photography and are the preferred imagery source for the on-screen digitizing. Should greater resolution be required for a database update, orthorectification of the digital aerial photography could be used to correct horizontal positional errors. Recently, software packages have become available to orthorectify aerial photographs effectively and affordably.The presence of extraneous features in the vegetation layer of the GIS database almost certainly contributes to the area discrepancies. Features such as windrows, fire ponds, and logging decks are included in vegetation polygon area but not silvicultural record area estimates. Future database improvements should consider subtracting these features (and their associated areas) from the vegetation layer and creating separate database layers for each type of feature. A methodology report was developed to accompany the GIS database as a reference for future updating. Continuous maintenance of the Hofmann Forest GIS database is necessary to provide timely information for on-site forest managers and research activities, and to preserve an account of forest conditions that may be useful in present and future management decisions. On-screen digitizing with integrated digital imagery proved to be a feasible method for updating and maintaining the Hofmann Forest GIS database.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-22</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forestry</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020419-104500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DISSOLUTION OF SOIL HEAVY METAL CONTAMINANTS AS AFFECTED BY pH AND REDOX POTENTIAL</field><field name="creator">BANG, JISU</field><field name="description">&lt;p&gt;The solubility of heavy metal (trace metal) contaminants in soils depends on metal concentration, chemical speciation, and conditions such as pH, redox potential, and ionic strength of the soil solution.

The Staircase Decomposition for Reductive Monoids. (Under the direction of Mohan Putcha.) The purpose of the research has been to develop a decomposition for the J-classes of a reductive monoid. The reductive monoid M(K) isconsidered first. A J-class in M(K) consists ofelements of the same rank. Lower and upper staircase matricesare defined and used to decompose a matrix x of rank r into theproduct of a lower staircase matrix, a matrix with a rank rpermutation matrix in the upper left hand corner, and an upperstaircase matrix, each of which is of rank r. The choice ofpermutation matrix is shown to be unique. The primary submatrix of a matrixis defined. The unique permutation matrix from the decompositionabove is seen to be the unique permutation matrix from Bruhat'sdecomposition for the primary submatrix. All idempotent elementsand regular J-classes of the lower and upper staircasematrices are determined. A decomposition for the upper and lowerstaircase matrices is given as well.The above results are then generalized to an arbitrary reductivemonoid by first determining the analogue of the components forthe decomposition above. Then the decomposition above is shown tobe valid for each J-class of a reductive monoid. Theanalogues of the upper and lower staircase matrices are shown tobe semigroups and all idempotent elements and regularJ-classes are determined. A decomposition for eachof them is discussed.&lt;P&gt;</field><field name="date">2002-04-29</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/theses/available/etd-20020422-102254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fibrinogen glycation and glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic subjects / L.T. G&#246;ttsche.</field><field name="creator">G&#246;ttsche, Louise Theresia</field><field name="description">Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a worldwide pandemic that causes both micro- and macrovascular complications. Although the causal relationship between chronic hyperglycaemia and microvascular disease have been established, the relationship between chronic hyperglycaemia and macrovascular disease (including cardiovascular disease (CVD)) is not yet well defined. A possible causal mechanism may be related to the glycation of haernostatic proteins such as fibrinogen. Hyperglycaemia causes non-enzymatic glycation of proteins through direct binding of carbohydrates (glucose and to a minor extent fructose) to proteins. The results of this study indicated that uncontrolled African type 2 diabetic subjects had a significantly higher level of fibrinogen glycation than non-diabetic subjects and that achievement of glycaemic control indeed resulted in a significant decrease in fibrinogen glycation. Glycated fibrinogen also correlates with and compares well with HbAlc in monitoring glycaemic control. By correlating end fibrinogen glycation levels with the average fasting capillary glucose of different 4-day time- intervals (fibrinogen has a half-life of 4 days) the study indicated that fibrinogen could be used as a short-term indicator of glycaemic control. Because fibrinogen is involved in vascular disease itself, glycated fibrinogen may be a better long-term predictor of CVD than current markers of glycaemic control. It may also aid in the elucidation of the relationship between hyperglycaemia and CVD. The results of this study showed that fibrinogen glycation is indeed sensitive to fluctuations in glycaemic control.</field><field name="date">2008-10-21T10:50:32Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die verband tussen die hoofskap en die gesag van Christus volgens Efesi&#235;rs en Kolossense en die betekenis daarvan vir gesagsverhoudings : 'n eksegetiese studie / Abraham Lodewikus Adriaan Buys</field><field name="creator">Buys, Abraham Lodewikus Adriaan</field><field name="description">Thesis (ThM (Nuwe Testament))--PU vir CHO, 1997.</field><field name="date">2009-02-20T08:02:30Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die rol van musiek as heelbrein-strategie by innerlike verandering : 'n prakties-teologiese studie / Johny Robert Elyon</field><field name="creator">Elyon, Johny Robert</field><field name="description">In the past, pastoral-therapeutic support was mainly approached only from the functioning of the left hemisphere of the brain. This implies that pastoral therapists mainly interacted with people in therapy at an intellectual-analytical level under modernistic influence. Since man's destitution and need changes along with time, it is essential for pastoral therapists/counsellors to supplement and adapt their modus operandi and strategies if they wish to remain relevant regarding their pastoral dealings with people. In this study the researcher attempted to formulate from the Scriptures a basis theory regarding the role of music as a whole-brain strategy in inner change. For the sake of a more holistic approach, a meta-theoretical investigation was also undertaken. To confirm the basis and meta-theoretical information, researcher entered the living reality of seven individuals during which a qualitative research was done. The results of the study, according to which the basis and meta-theoretical perspectives were placed in hermeneutical relation to one another, led to practice-theoretical guidelines within the subject domain of Practical Theology regarding the role of music as a whole-brain strategy in inner change.</field><field name="date">2009-02-20T08:03:14Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Praise and worship</field><field name="subject">Liturgy</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Inner change</field><field name="subject">Inner man</field><field name="subject">Practical theology</field><field name="subject">Whole-brain strategy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Funeral policy conversion within AVBOB Mutual Assurance Society / L.

Keretetse</field><field name="creator">Keretetse, Goitsemang Salvation</field><field name="description">Petrol attendants are exposed to petrol volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which may have genotoxic and carcinogenic effects. The single cell gel electrophoresis assay (comet assay) is a method highly sensitive to DNA damage induced by environmental and occupational exposure to carcinogenic and mutagenic agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of exposure of petrol attendants to petrol VOCs and also to determine their effect on DNA damage and repair in lymphocytes of African petrol attendants. The exposed group consisted of 20 subjects, randomly selected from three petrol stations. A control group of 20 unexposed subjects was also chosen and matched for age and smoking habits with the exposed group. Sorbent tubes were used to assess personal exposure of petrol attendants. The comet assay was used to investigate the basal DNA damage and repair capacity in isolated lymphocytes of petrol attendants and control subjects. Blood samples were taken from the petrol attendants at the end of their 8 hour working shift and also from the control subjects. The petrol attendants were found to be exposed to levels of petrol VOCs lower than the occupational exposure limit (OEL) for constituent chemicals. A significant relationship was found between the volume of petrol sold during the shift and the average concentrations of benzene, toluene and the total VOCs measured. However, relative humidity had a negative correlation with the average concentrations of benzene, toluene, xylene and the total VOCs. Significantly higher basal DNA damage was observed with the exposed group compared to the control group. The period of exposure influenced the level of DNA damage and the calculated repair capacity. Smoking and age had a significant influence on the level of DNA damage. DNA repair capacity was delayed in smokers of both exposed and non-exposed group.</field><field name="date">2009-02-24T10:07:31Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">DNA repair</field><field name="subject">Comet assay</field><field name="subject">Petrol attendant</field><field name="subject">Volatile organic compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation of dendritic catalysts for alkene metathesis / Z.H.

Ker. Gawl. under different resource conditions / J.L. Arnolds</field><field name="creator">Arnolds, Judith Lize</field><field name="description">Little is known of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying competitive interactions between alien invasive grasses and native taxa, and how these are affected by resource supply. Consequently, this study compared photosystem II (PS II) function, photosynthetic gas and water exchange, enzyme and pigment concentrations, flowering and biomass accumulation in an indigenous geophyte, Tritonia crocata (L.) Ker. Gawl., grown in monoculture and admixed with the alien grass, Lolium multiflorum Lam., at different levels of water and nutrient supply. Diminished stomatal conductances were the primary cause of reduced net C02 assimilation rates, and consequent biomass accumulation in T. crocata admixed with L. multiflorum at all levels of water and nutrient supply with one exception. These corresponded with decreased soil water contents induced presumably by more efficient competition for water by L. multiflorum, whose biomass was inversely correlated with soil water content. Biochemical impairments to photosynthesis were also apparent in T. crocata admixed with L. multiflorum at low levels of water and nutrient supply. These included a decline in the density of working photosystems (reaction center per chlorophyll RC/ABS), which corresponded with a decreased leaf chlorophyll a content and a decreased efficiency of conversion of excitation energy to electron transport (&#165;0 / l-^o), pointing to a reduction in electron transport capacity beyond QA~, a decline in apparent carboxylation efficiency and Rubisco content. At low nutrient levels but high water supply, non-stomatal induced biochemical impairments to photosynthesis (decreased RC/ABS, chlorophyll a and Rubisco content) were apparent in T. crocata admixed with L. multiflorum. These attributed to a reallocation of fixed carbohydrate reserves to floral production which increased significantly in T. crocata under these conditions only and associated with a corresponding reduction in the mass of its underground storage organ (bulb). The results of this study did not support the hypothesis that under conditions of low water and low nutrient supply invasive annual grasses would have a lesser impact on the growth and physiology of native geophytes than under resource enriched conditions that favor growth of these grasses. Unresolved is whether resource limitation and allelopathic mechanisms functioned simultaneously in the inhibition of the native geophyte by the alien grass.</field><field name="date">2009-03-16T12:57:32Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Growth</field><field name="subject">Lolium multiflorum</field><field name="subject">Photosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Photosystem II</field><field name="subject">Pigments</field><field name="subject">Rubisco</field><field name="subject">Tritonia crocata</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model of consumers' perceptions of food additives and consequent purchasing behaviour / Emmerentia Gertruida Dicks</field><field name="creator">Dicks, Emmerentia Gertruida</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (Consumer Science))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008.</field><field name="date">2009-03-16T13:50:51Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer behaviour</field><field name="subject">Elaboration likelihood model of persuasive communication</field><field name="subject">Food additives</field><field name="subject">Food labelling</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Purchasing behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gesprekforums : 'n instrument vir werkerdeelname in die Suid-Afrikaanse Polisie / deur Marius Janse van Rensburg</field><field name="creator">Van Rensburg, Marius Janse</field><field name="description">Skripsie (MBA)--PU vir CHO, 1995.</field><field name="date">2009-03-16T14:21:50Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The treatment of asthma : a managed pharmaceutical care approach / Pieter Johannes Kilian</field><field name="creator">Kilian, Pieter Johannes</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.

The first stage brought the development of an established farming community and a viable village community with all basic public services required by the population of the district. White settlement in the district dates back to 1823 when missionaries Broadbent and Hodgson of the Wesleyan Missionary Society settled among the Barolong near the present Witpoort. However, their missionary work was terminated in 1825 when they moved with the tribe to the Orange Free State. The Voortrekkers were the next whites to enter and to settle in the Wolmaransstad district in the forties. From 1845 onward they gradually moved westward from Potchefstroom to settle in the present Wolmaransstad district. This stage of settlement was completed around 1870 when all the farms available in the district had been occupied. The Wolmaransstad district was in demand among the Boers because there were very few Blacks in the area and because the climate and the indigenous vegetation of the district were conducive to stock farming. Initially the Boers practised farming mainly for their own sustenance, but as the subdivision of the farms increased and more scientific and intensive farming methods were introduced because of the discovery of diamonds and gold, dry-land farming became more common and mixed farming was introduced in the district. The history of farming in the Transvaal in the nineteenth century is the story of a long battle against all the problems which beset it. The problems of the pioneer days revolved around the process of taming the land and of settling on it. There was great poverty among the Boers which was brought about by the instability and disruption of the Great Trek. In the course of time some were able to overcome this problem, whilst others became labourers and city dwellers. In the pioneer days beasts of prey were a very real menace to the farmers' stock herds but this problem gradually disappeared as the district became settled. The Blacks created a very real problem from the fifties. This poor relationship was a menace to the Boer and his dear ones as well as to his property and it increasingly disrupted his farming activities. Relations between Boers and Blacks became very tense and came to a climax during the Anglo-Boer War when the Blacks joined the British forces against the Boers. Furthermore farming activities were greatly hampered by a shortage of labour. To solve this problem the Boers turned to the Blacks and eventually came to lean so heavily upon them that black labour became an indispensable element of farming activities. Farmers were at a complete loss when many thousands of farm labourers were enticed away from the farms by higher wages after the establishment of the diamond and gold mines in the seventies and eighties. This problem was aggravated by squatting on unoccupied farms and by the rinderpest through which many Blacks lost all their livestock and were driven from the farms to the cities. By the end of the nineteenth century it was the labour shortage which had the most crippling effect on farming. Initially there was no shortage of water but it was gradually brought about by the subdivision of the farms. This problem was not to be solved within the period covered by this thesis. Windmills were introduced and put to general use only after the advent of the Union. During the first few decades farming was severely hampered by the absence of adequate marketing facilities which prevented the transition from sustenance farming to a more specialised form of farming. The possible advantages of markets created by the discovery of diamonds in Kimberley and of gold on the Witwatersrand were offset by the long distances and the bad roads. This problem was felt throughout the nineteenth century. Nature and its elements also created certain farming problems. The farmers of the time were rather defenceless against and in fact often ruined by factors such as prolonged droughts, locusts and plant and stock diseases. The rinderpest alone mowed down more than 30000 head of cattle in the Wolmaransstad district. Many farmers snapped under these losses and were driven off the farms. Then farmers had to face such problems as unfenced farms, the impoverishment of the soil and the shrinking of farms caused by ill-considered subdivision of land. Farmers in the Wolmaransstad district had to face these problems which were very common in the nineteenth century. Some were solved successfully whilst others seemed to get worse. Towards the end of the nineteenth century the total impact of these problems placed the farming community in a precarious position which eventually brought financial ruin to many farmers when coupled with the crippling effect of the Anglo-Boer War on the agricultural industry. Until 1876 when T.S. Leask opened a trading store at Makwassiespruit, farming was the only economic activity in the district. But this introduced a new era in which trading was practised in addition to farming. In effect the opening of the store was the establishment of the town. The store soon became a venue for traders, hunters, farmers and transport riders. And eventually there grew a settlement around the store which by the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War had become the town of Wolmaransstad. Among the landmarks in this process of development of the town and district were the proclamation of the town in 1891, the proclamation of Wolmaransstad as a separate magisterial district in 1894, the demarcation of district boundaries in 1895, the appointment of a magistrate in 1896 and the building of a gaol and police station in 1896 and 1897 respectively. The first hotel was erected in 1888 followed by the extension of postal amenities through the introduction of a telegraph office in 1889 and money-order facilities in 1891. A health committee was established in 1896 whilst a lawyer and a medical practitioner opened their practices in 1896 and 1899 respectively. In the religious field the people of the district had to rely upon the services of visiting parsons from the three Afrikaans denominations from Potchefstroom. They conducted religious services in the Makwassie area at least once per year to administer the baptism, the Holy Communion and the confirmation. The Rev. D. van der Hoff of the Hervormde Kerk at Potchefstroom played a prominent role in this connection.</field><field name="date">2009-04-15T13:07:27Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die leierskapsrol en -bevoegdhede van die skoolhoof en die bedryfsleier : 'n vergelykende studie / J.A.

This self-report questionnaire, referred to as the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory -Revised Form (ZTPI-RF) consists of 20 items representing the five subscales of the original scale, namely: Past-Positive, Past-Negative, Present-Hedonistic, Present-Fatalistic and Future. The ZTPI-RF was completed by participants (N=1050) from urban (n=451) and rural (n=599) areas in the North-West Province of South Africa, together with a number of measures of psychological well-being. These scales, which were included for criterion-related validity purposes, were the Affectometer 2 (short version) (Kammann &amp; Flett, 1983), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen &amp; Griffin, 1985), Sense of Coherence Scale (Antonovsky, 1987, 1993) and the General Health Questionnaire (Goldberg &amp; Hillier, 1979). Results regarding the reliability and construct validity of the ZTPI-RF and its subscales were unsatisfactory. Qualitative data was also obtained, and analyzed by means of direct content analysis to help establish a picture of how time perspective prevails in an African context, and to determine whether time perspective is associated with psychological well-being. Qualitative results showed that participants from an African context were strongly oriented toward the present and that social support played the most prominent role regarding participants' attitude toward the present. It was concluded that the ZTPI-RF is, in its current form, not reliable for the determination of time perspective of individuals from an African context, and that a longitudinal qualitative approach might be best suited to obtain information about the nature and dynamics of time perspective in an African context.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T08:31:12Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Time perspective</field><field name="subject">African</field><field name="subject">Zimbardo time perspective inventory</field><field name="subject">Psychometric properties</field><field name="subject">Reliability</field><field name="subject">Validity</field><field name="subject">Psychological well-being</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterization and pharmaceutical application of selected copolymer nanoparticles / D.P.

The specialized application and investigation of copolymers in drug delivery resulted in the synthesis of two series of copolymeric materials, i.e. poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate) (P(St-co-MMA)) and poly(styrene-co-ethyl methacrylate) (P(St-co-EMA)) were synthesized via the technique of o/w microemulsion copolymerization. These copolymers have not as yet been utilized to their full potential in the development of new drug delivery systems. However the corresponding hydrophobic homopolymer poly(styrene) (PS) and the hydrophilic homopolymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are known to be biocompatible. Blending of homopolymers could result in novel applications, however is virtually impossible due to their unfavorable mixing entropies. The immiscibility challenge was overcome by the synthesis of copolymers that combined the properties of the immiscible homopolymers. The synthesized particles were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography combined with multi-angle laser light scattering (GPC-MALLS) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). These characterizations revealed crucial information to better understand the synthesis process and particle properties i.e. molecular weight, nanoparticle size and chemical composition of the materials. Additionally, GPC-MALLS revealed the copolymer chain conformation. These characterizations ultimately guided the selection of appropriate copolymer nanoparticles to develop a controlled-release drug delivery system. The selected copolymers were dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, tetrahydrofuran (THF) together with a drug, rifampin. Solvent casting of this dispersion resulted in the evaporation of the solvent and assembly of numerous microscale copolymer capsules. The rifampin molecules were captured in these microcapsules through a process of phase separation and coacervation. These microcapsules finally sintered to produce a multi-layer film with an unusual honeycomb structure, bridging yet another size scale hierarchy. Characterization of these delivery systems revealed that both series of copolymer materials produced films capable of controlling drug release and that could also potentially prevent biofilm adhesion.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T09:07:20Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microemulsion copolymerization</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticle</field><field name="subject">GPC-MALLS</field><field name="subject">Microcapsule film</field><field name="subject">Controlled release</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and evaluation of 1-methyl-3-pyrrolines and 1-methylpyrroles as substrates and inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B / Modupe O.

In the course of developments for treatment of PD, the discovery of the inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO B) was a conceptual breakthrough, and has now been firmly established. MAO B has also been implicated in the neurodegenerative processes resulting from exposure to xenobiotic amines. For example, MAO B catalyzes the first step of the bioactivation of the parkinsonian inducing pro-neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Additional insight into the mechanism of catalysis of MAO B and the mechanism of neurotoxicity by MPTP is therefore very valuable in the pursuit of the treatment of PD.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T09:10:47Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monoamine oxidase B</field><field name="subject">MPTP</field><field name="subject">1-methyl-3-phenyl-3-pyrroline</field><field name="subject">1-methyl-3-phenyl-3-pyrrole</field><field name="subject">Neurotoxicity</field><field name="subject">Dopamine</field><field name="subject">Striata</field><field name="subject">Reversible inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Competitive inhibition</field><field name="subject">Structure-activity relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of an employee value proposition / Jaco Parreira</field><field name="creator">Parreira, Jaco</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.B.A.)--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T09:11:16Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evaluation of the establishment and growth of indigenous trees to restore deforested riparian areas in the Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa / Theo Scholtz</field><field name="creator">Scholtz, Theo</field><field name="description">The deforestation of riparian areas is a major concern in southern Africa. These areas are characterized as fragile ecosystems which contribute largely to the regional and global biodiversity of the world. It is therefore important to restore these degraded areas along the natural rivers of South Africa to ensure the sustainability and biodiversity of riparian corridors. Riparian areas inside the National Parks of South Africa, and especially in Mapungubwe National Park, have a high esthetical value and should be preserved for future generations. The study was conducted in the Mapungubwe National Park, which is listed as a cultural world heritage site. Plans are in place to convert it into one of Africa's biggest Transfrontier Parks, called the Limpopo/Shashe Transfrontier Conservation Area (TFCA), which will be situated between neighbouring countries Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa. The main purpose of this project was to establish a demonstration site for the restoration of degraded, previously cultivated lands in the deforested riparian areas in the Mapungubwe National Park, Limpopo Province. Another aim of the project was to evaluate the theoretical assumption that the growth of trees on so called "activity lines" in the environment due to geological and soil characteristics is enhanced. "Activity lines" were identified by Mr. Lynn van Rooyen of South African National Parks (SANParks) and trees of which the growth was tested, were planted both on and off "activity lines". The selection of the right type of trees for the restoration of the deforested riparian areas during active restoration applications is very important and depends on a multitude of factors. These factors include aspects such as the location with its specific vegetation, soil type and climatic conditions, the historical background of the management practices such as previous land uses, as well as other environmental impacts that previously occurred in the area to be restored. The latter can be gained through interviews with previous and present managers of the area, as well as maps, reports and aerial photographs. Ten different indigenous tree species that previously occurred in the area were planted in an experimental demonstration site of approximately 70ha, which was enclosed by an electrical game fence. The ten tree species that were evaluated included: Faidherbia albida (Ana tree), Acacia nigrescens (Knob thorn), Acacia tortilis (Umbrella thorn), Schotia brachypetala (Weeping boer-bean), Acacia xanthophloea (Fever tree), Lonchocarpus capassa, recently renamed Philenoptera violacea (Apple-leaf), Salvadora australis (Narrow-leaved mustard tree), Adansonia digitata (Baobab), Combretum imberbe (Leadwood) and Xanthocercis  zambesiaca (Nyala tree). With the aid of aerial photographs, phytosociological studies, interviews with previous and present land users and managers, as well as existing surrounding vegetation, four different zones within the enclosure were identified according to ecotones. The establishment, growth and survival rate of the different tree species were monitored using morphological and physiological vegetation sampling techniques, as well as leaf component analyses on individuals of selected species. Soil physical and chemical analyses were carried out in the four different blocks identified within the experimental site. Data analysis was carried out on both the soil and leaf component analyses using the CANOCO-package. The establishment of the experimental site was successful, and important information was collected on various aspects of restoration activities. Positive growth effects were also observed in certain indigenous tree species concerning the "activity line" effect, especially with regard to Acacia tortilis and Combretum imberbe. However, the preliminary results obtained through this pilot study showed no conclusive evidence to what exactly stimulated the enhanced growth phenomena observed in certain individual tree species planted on "activity lines". Additional watering was identified as the most important factor contributing to successful establishment and growth of indigenous tree species in this semi-arid area. Various results showed a multiplying effect when a combination of additional watering and "activity lines" was applied. It was concluded that, should any further restoration work be conducted in the degraded areas of the Mapungubwe National Park, the planting of trees should be done on "activity lines" and with the addition of water. This will result in higher establishment rates of transplanted trees and speed up the succession processes involved in the natural "healing process" of degraded areas. Parameters that should be used for monitoring tree growth include the trunk thickness at the base, trunk thickness at 30cm from the base, and the length of the tree in its natural growth form. Recommendations were also made as reference for future restoration practices to ensure better and more successful and sustainable outcomes in the planting of trees. These include the use of nurse plants such as Acacia tortilis and Salvadora australis to establish a more favourable microclimate for climax species, as well as the establishment of a preferred herbaceous layer. Care should be taken in the period required for the cultivation of indigenous trees before they are transplanted into the field, as a prolonged cultivation period could lead to a circular growth form of the root system, preventing sufficient penetration ability of the roots into deeper, more nutrient rich soils. Before trees can be planted into the field, a hardening period must be applied to all seedlings for at least a three week period. This entails the exposure to more direct sunlight for longer periods as well as a reduction in the water applied weekly. Special attention should be paid to the stresses caused by herbivory, especially that of termites and porcupines. The maintenance of the exclosure is a critical factor contributing to the successful outcomes of this particular restoration project. Problem animals, especially elephants, should be kept out of the exclosure at all costs. The results of this project can be used in this ongoing restoration program, as well as in other related projects in semi-arid, degraded savannah areas over the long-term.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T09:11:59Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activity lines</field><field name="subject">Indigenous trees</field><field name="subject">Morphological monitoring parameters</field><field name="subject">Restoration of riparian areas</field><field name="subject">Exclosures</field><field name="subject">Effect of watering on indigenous trees</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independence and impartiality of arbitrators / by Tania Steenkamp</field><field name="creator">Steenkamp, Tania</field><field name="description">Thesis (LL.M.)--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T09:18:21Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arbiter</field><field name="subject">Arbitration</field><field name="subject">European court of human rights</field><field name="subject">Independence and impartiality</field><field name="subject">International arbitral institutions</field><field name="subject">International commercial arbitration</field><field name="subject">Separation of powers</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">United Kingdom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fingerprinting Pennisetum purpureum Schumach. varieties and cultivars using ALFP analyses / M. Struwig</field><field name="creator">Struwig, Madeleen</field><field name="description">Pennisetum Rich, is one of the most important genera in the family Poaceae because it includes forage and crop species such as Pennisetum purpureum Schumach. and Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. Both P. purpureum and P. glaucum have a number of cultivars and varieties arising due to natural crossing which are very difficult to distinguish morphologically. P. purpureum and P. glaucum also hybridize naturally because they are protogynous and cross pollinated. The resulting hybrids are highly sterile and resemble P. purpureum. Lepidopteran stem borers cause great yield loss in maize produced by resource-poor farmers in Africa and are managed by habitat management or push-pull strategies, in which P. purpureum cultivars and hybrids are used as a trap crop. The aims of this project were to genotype different P. purpureum cultivars and hybrids using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) as well as Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in order to identify cultivars and hybrids and possible misidentifications, assess the congruency of results between AFLPs and RAPDs and to attempt to relate these results to the oviposition preference of Chilo partellus for different P. purpureum cultivars. The individuals to be fingerprinted were collected from several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, a few from the USA and one from China. The AFLP analysis of these individuals were done with primer combinations EcoRI/MseI and Mlul/Msel on polyacrylamide gels and an ABI 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer respectively. The automated sequencer visualized more bands than the polyacrylamide gels. The RAPD technology was not developed any further after 17 primers were tested and no polymorphic bands detected. Overall results indicated that cultivars did not cluster according to geographical origin, and cultivars known by popular names did not always cluster together, indicating diversity within the cultivar or misidentifications. An example of a misidentification is the cultivar Green Gold being no other than cultivar Harare, or cultivar Swaziland 3 being cultivar Sanitas. Proper management by nursery managers cannot be stressed enough, as this will prevent plants getting mixed up, causing confusion. There was no relationship between the relatedness of cultivars and moth oviposition preference. The AFLP technology could be a powerful tool for the DNA fingerprinting and molecular characterization of this grass species, but poor germ plasm management negates its application.</field><field name="date">2009-05-22T09:19:14Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Napier grass</field><field name="subject">Pennisetum species</field><field name="subject">AFLP</field><field name="subject">RAPD</field><field name="subject">Germ plasm management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evaluation of ESL textbooks : a sociolinguistic perspective / Kulukazi Theodorah Soldati-Kahimbaara</field><field name="creator">Soldati-Kahimbaara, Kulukazi Theodorah</field><field name="description">http://www.crimsa.ac.za/WebZ/Authorize:sessionid=0:autho=guest:password=guest1&amp;&amp;context;/AdvancedQuery?&amp;next=crim/crim_abstract.html&amp;bad=error/badsearchframe.html</field><field name="date">2009-05-29T08:04:13Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The teaching of the ESL writing skill in Afrikaans secondary schools : a didactic evaluation / Marinda Terblanche</field><field name="creator">Terblanche, Marinda</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEd)--PU for CHE, 1993.</field><field name="date">2009-05-29T08:04:39Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/1880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mede-afhanklikheid en identiteit : 'n pastorale studie / A.M.

The principal strategy on the government, and for that matter municipalities for poverty alleviation is to promote sustainable development (better quality of life for all) through the process of integrated development planning (IDP). Municipalities are, by virtue of legislation, required by the Government to use Integrated Development Planning as the vehicle to improve and fast-track service delivery and development. One of the main objectives of the IDP is to promote sustainable development. The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the IDP is used to promote sustainable development at Emfuleni Local Municipality (ELM). For the purpose of the study, the hypothesis was formulated that the implementation of IDP as a tool for promoting sustainable development within ELM is significant for improving service delivery and the living standard of local communities. To test the validity or otherwise of the hypothesis use was made of theoretical review of literature in promoting sustainable development at ELM. Further there was an empirical research method of open-ended questionnaires that was used to test attitudes and perceptions of municipal officials, IDP representatives and the community of ELM on the effectiveness of IDP. It was found among others that:The council and management of ELM consider the IDP as effective management tool in promoting sustainable development; ELM has elaborate plans and mechanisms for initiating programmes on the IDP; Public participation in the process needs to be intensified. While the municipality has achieved much success with the use of the IDP, the rural residents of ELM are largely ignorant of the process and its benefits. The study ends with recommendations for improvement of the IDP process.</field><field name="date">2009-09-28T08:59:36Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Policy frame work</field><field name="subject">Promotion</field><field name="subject">Strategic plan</field><field name="subject">Integrated development</field><field name="subject">Implementation</field><field name="subject">Service delivery</field><field name="subject">Environment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2265</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'n Oorsig van weerbare leerders in 'n tegniese ho&#235;rskool / Gerda Klopper</field><field name="creator">Klopper, Gertruida Maria</field><field name="description">This empirical research study focuses on the qualities of resilient adolescents in a technical school. The study indicates why some adolescents in a technical school are resilient, while other adolescents in this technical school are not resilient. Thirty resilient and thirty non-resilient adolescents in a technical school were chosen to participate in the empirical study. The empirical study consisted of quantitative research (a questionaire that was completed by the sixty adolescents), and qualitative research (three chosen resilient adolescents took part in an interview). This study is therefore a mixed methods study. The conclusions of the study were supported by the literature. The qualities of the resilient adolescent in a technical school are similar to the qualities of resilient adolescents in other contexts. Resilient adolescents in this technical school were characterized by protective factors and processes that had their roots in the individual, the community, culture and relationships. This study is an explorative study. More rigorous research is needed before this study's findings can be generalised.</field><field name="date">2009-10-05T13:07:42Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Adolescent</field><field name="subject">Protective factors</field><field name="subject">Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Technical School</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2267</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The neglect of cities in the missionary work of the Reformed Churches in Southern Africa with special reference to churches of Synod Soutpansberg / by Muswubi Takalani Aaron</field><field name="creator">Muswubi, Takalani Aaron</field><field name="description">This research reviewed the neglect of cities in the mission work of the Reformed Churches in Southern Africa with a special reference to churches of Synod Soutpansberg. The biblical passage, Jeremiah 29:1-14 was used, as a representative of other biblical passages, to shed light on the role of cities in mission work of the church while addressing misconceptions and false theology about the cities and the role they played and still play in the mission work of the church. The same biblical message is confirmed by many missiology literature, including, "Cities, Missions' New Frontier" by R.S. Greenway and T.M. Monsma (1989); "City of God - City of Satan" by R.C. Linthicum(1991) and "Discipling the City" by R.S. Greenway (1992). The biblical message and the missiology literature mentioned above were the basis from which the neglect of the role of the cities in the history of the mission work of the Reformed Churches in Southern Africa was studied. From these basis, the causes, implementations and effects of such neglect in the mission work of the Soutpansberg churches was studied in Chapter 3. The empirical research was conducted using the interview questionnaire in Chapter 4. The empirical results and findings, which were presented in this research, can direct churches towards a remedy of the neglect of the cities in their mission work as far as the strategies is concerned. The neglect of the cities in the history of the mission work of the Reformed Churches in Southern Africa was studied with an aim that churches learn from it and hence avoid the past neglect in their present and future mission plans, strategies and programs. In other words, the lesson is important for churches to view the role of the secular cities as important instruments used by God to speed up not only the planting and growing big holy churches from those secular cities outwards, but also the biblical reformation of the rural - orientated theories, strategies and practice!</field><field name="date">2009-10-05T13:10:28Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neglect</field><field name="subject">Cities</field><field name="subject">Mission work</field><field name="subject">Reformed churches</field><field name="subject">Southern Africa</field><field name="subject">Synod Soutpansberg</field><field name="subject">Misconceptions</field><field name="subject">False theology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sensory, lipid and haemostatic profile evaluation of a potential functional food using red palm olein / Susanna Catharina Scholtz</field><field name="creator">Scholtz, Susanna Catharina</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (Nutrition))--Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003.</field><field name="date">2009-10-08T07:17:16Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experiences of widowhood and beliefs about the mourning process of the Batswana people / Mofatiki Eva Manyedi</field><field name="creator">Manyedi, Mofatiki Eva</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.Cur.)--Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001.</field><field name="date">2009-10-08T07:18:10Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The concept 'people's war' in the strategy of the ANC and the PAC : a comparative analysis / Willem Jacobus Booyse</field><field name="creator">Booyse, Willem Jacobus</field><field name="description">Thesis (DPhil)--PU for CHE, 1991.</field><field name="date">2009-10-08T07:19:20Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2271</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the construction of Tswana cultural identity in selected Tswana literary texts / Gabaitsiwe Elizabeth Pilane</field><field name="creator">Pilane, Gabaitsiwe Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (African Languages))--Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003.</field><field name="date">2009-10-12T08:16:59Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dialect-geographical survey of the phonology of the central, eastern and southern dialects of Tswana : a comparative analysis / by Adam Tsele Malepe</field><field name="creator">Malepe, A.

In chapter 2 of the literature study, the researcher focused on aspects that influence discipline at school. In chapter 3, she also looked at education law aspects that have a direct influence on education. Two structured questionnaires were used in the quantitative research. These questionnaires were distributed separately between educators and learners at nine schools of the Free State Department of Education's Fezile Dabi District. From the findings of this study, it is clear that discipline indeed has an enormous influence on teaching at public schools. The Constitution (1996) and Schools Act (84/1996) make the application of effective discipline at schools possible.</field><field name="date">2009-10-27T10:49:15Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Determine</field><field name="subject">Influence</field><field name="subject">Discipline</field><field name="subject">Teaching</field><field name="subject">Public schools</field><field name="subject">Aspects</field><field name="subject">Education law</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of "self" in the context of the family : a pastoral-theological study / O.

The Highveld contains fertile soils, a fine climate, and an abundance of water. The area has always been extensively used for crop and stock farming, but in general, mixed farming was practiced. The farmers depended on the availability of water, therefore their experiences, observations, weather forecasts, and conclusions, developed into a popular folk meteorology. Furthermore, environmental factors such as local topography, micro climate, hydrography, ground fertility, and the appearance of natural vegetation determined whether or not an area was suitable for permanent residence. The farmstead may be divided into three functional zones (the core-, extended-, and outer farmyard) that are joined by a canal network, used for irrigation and drinking water. The farmhouse and buildings, erected a stones throw away from the water source, served as a focal point for the activities of the farmer. The manipulation of the water source by obstruction of streams and the construction of water canals, weirs and water furrows, assisted the farmer in planning his activities and in using the water to his advantage. The settlement and development of the residence on the rural parts of the Highveld may be divided into three distinct phases. Firstly, the temporary trekboer phase, secondly the pioneer phase and thirdly the permanent settlement phase. The permanence of residence had a direct influence in the layout of the house, the method of construction, and the use of the available water supply. At first, the trekkers were content to reside in roof dwellings (their wagons and tents and a grass screen as their kitchen and a hut near a spring). The first houses were hartbieshuise and kapsteilhuise. The more permanent homesteads of the earlier settlers were a simple rectangular structure (pioneer house) with a saddle grass roof. With the introduction of galvanised iron sheeting, the house was expanded and developed into the veranda-, stoeproom- and a flat roofed rectangular house. This development resulted into a typical rural Highveld homestead. After the discovery of gold in the vicinity of the Witwatersrand, the first gold rush took place resulting in the proclamation of Johannesburg in 1886. Prospectors, mostly foreigners, descended upon the Witwatersrand. Housing took on a more planned structure resembling the late Victorian period of housing in England. The water supply and drainage systems were planned and improved, making it possible to provide running water to kitchens and bathrooms. This impacted firstly on the upper riches of society in the cities, later on the lower middle classes and lastly on the rural areas. European technology regarding the supply of hot pipe water and drainage systems changed the layout of the house. The cooking activity moved from outside behind a screen to a seperate room inside the house. Inevitable changes regarding collecting, storage, purpose, saving and drainage of household water took place. Between 1840 and 1910, evolutionary changes took place regarding sanitation, water supply and personal hygiene. Being part of a particular social class made certain facilities available to certain individuals. A rural Highveld dwelling rarely included sanitary facilities, instead dwellers had a more primitive wash basin in each room in which they washed daily. On a Saturday, a weekly bath was taken in a bathtub in the kitchen or bedroom. Trekkers simply relieved themselves outside. A revolution in sanitary habits and facilities became inevitable. The Victorian dwelling on the Highveld was built according to a standard plan, including a flush water system already in place. This was the ultimate manifestation of sophistication and civilization. The aim of this investigation is to identify the similarities and differences between the use of water by the pioneer, the poor people and the wealthy in their rural dwellings. Furthermore, information has been obtained regarding water usage and sanitation in the bathroom and kitchen in the rural dwelling to be useful in the area of historic architecture and the heritage of our water history.</field><field name="date">2009-10-27T10:50:20Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Availability of water</field><field name="subject">Immediate environment</field><field name="subject">Abundance of water</field><field name="subject">Micro climate</field><field name="subject">Canal network</field><field name="subject">Drinking water</field><field name="subject">Drainage systems</field><field name="subject">Highveld homes</field><field name="subject">Rural dwellings</field><field name="subject">Sanitation</field><field name="subject">Water supply</field><field name="subject">Wash basin</field><field name="subject">Bathtub</field><field name="subject">Victorian dwelling</field><field name="subject">Identify</field><field name="subject">Similarities</field><field name="subject">Differences</field><field name="subject">Pioneer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2291</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die pastorale begeleiding van persone wat emosioneel verwond is / Christo Herbst</field><field name="creator">Herbst, Christiaan Frederick</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.A. (Pastoral))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008.</field><field name="date">2009-10-29T06:36:59Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prayer therapy</field><field name="subject">Emotional woundedness</field><field name="subject">Pastoral</field><field name="subject">Forgiveness</field><field name="subject">Therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the formalisation of the informal sector liquor industry / Petrus Johannes Brits</field><field name="creator">Brits, Petrus Johannes</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.B.A.)--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009.</field><field name="date">2009-10-29T06:37:35Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shebeen</field><field name="subject">Legalisation</field><field name="subject">Informal sector</field><field name="subject">Liquor</field><field name="subject">Distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2295</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destination branding : a case study of the Kruger National Park / J.W.

The study explored the role of the educator as manager of change, to what extent EI contributes to workplace success and how change impacts disadvantaged, mixed and ex-Model C schools. The ultimate purpose was to develop a possible framework to assist educators to manage the process of change in an emotionally intelligent way. In developing such a framework, the focus was on the following aspects: To present an overview of the educator as manager of change. To delineate EI as important contributor to workplace success. To explore the change management process in disadvantaged, mixed and ex-Model C secondary schools in the Gauteng Province and the Eastern Cape Province. The literature study revealed that the emotional well-being of the educator and the learner is increasingly recognised as an important predictor of success in school, family and work life. Furthermore, EI is widely accepted as foundational to getting along with others in the workplace, as well as being a primary managerial and leadership competency. EI is also believed by many to be the determinant of who advances most quickly in an organization, and EI skills may be particularly useful when the organization is undergoing change. Emotionally intelligent managers are therefore better able to cope with the inevitability of change within the organization, tolerate uncertainty, build employee commitment, motivate others, communicate effectively, manage conflict, reduce employees' anxiety and thus enhance performance. The empirical study consisted of a structured questionnaire distributed to a sample population of educators and learners in the Gauteng Province and the Eastern Cape Province. It was aimed at gathering information about the process of change in six secondary schools and how educators and learners cope with change. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with members of the School Management Team (SMT) and the School Governing Body (SGB) members at each school. The main findings of the empirical investigation revealed that educators and learners lack the tools to deal with change in school and in their everyday lives effectively. An EI competency framework for change was proposed to assist educators to deal with change in an emotionally intelligent way. The framework was structured to provide Gauteng and Eastern Cape schools with a usable tool for implementing EI so that they may cope effectively with change.</field><field name="date">2009-11-03T10:41:41Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investigate</field><field name="subject">Impact</field><field name="subject">Emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">Educator's role</field><field name="subject">Managers of change</field><field name="subject">Workplace</field><field name="subject">Success</field><field name="subject">Change</field><field name="subject">Mixed schools</field><field name="subject">Framework</field><field name="subject">Process</field><field name="subject">Disadvantaged schools</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical factors for project success in an engineering environment / Francois Vorster</field><field name="creator">Vorster, Francois</field><field name="description">Not every project deserving of success achieves it. Conversely, not every project heading for the scrap heap arrives. The journey to project success is long and hard and does not happen overnight. To understand the journey to project success we need to understand what makes a project successful. A successful project can be classified as a Project of which the costs did not exceed 25% of the agreed capital approved with a less than 25% schedule slip and with all the operational problems being sorted out in less than a year. Project success potential, can be increased by focusing on the critical factors listed in this study, namely: Project Front End Loading (FEL), high calibre project teams, and people skills/soft skills of project management. The success of a project can be increased when the project has high calibre project teams starting the project with very effective Front End Loading (FEL) and keep project team members continuity based on the fact that the project is managed by a project manager understanding people who have the soft skill to lead and influence the project team, rather than managing the team. The research was conducted by means of a literature and empirical study. The literature study documents the critical factors for project success. Knowledge gained from the literature study formed the basis for the empirical study to test critical factors for project success in practice and the recommendations can be read in chapter four.</field><field name="date">2009-11-03T10:43:57Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Journey</field><field name="subject">Project</field><field name="subject">Successful</field><field name="subject">Costs</field><field name="subject">Capital</field><field name="subject">Approved</field><field name="subject">Operational</field><field name="subject">Problems</field><field name="subject">Critical factors</field><field name="subject">Front end loading</field><field name="subject">High calibre project teams</field><field name="subject">People skills</field><field name="subject">Soft skills</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A strategy for the effective management of the implementation of the revised national curriculum statement grades R-9 (schools) in the North-West Province / Tutu Lawrence Faleni</field><field name="creator">Faleli, Tutu Lawrence</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (Education))--North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2006.</field><field name="date">2009-11-09T09:48:48Z</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An alternative to an operational system and data warehouse systems : a conceptual model / Phillip J. v.

As such, the decision to assess the state of the field in Lifetime Value Modelling, and outline challenges unique to choice researchers in customer relationship management (CRM). As the research has argued, there are an excess of issues and analytical challenges that remain unresolved. The researcher hopes that this thesis inspires new answers and new approaches to resolve LTV. The scope of this project covers the building of a LTV model through multiple regression. This thesis is exclusively focused on modelling tenure. In this regard, there are a variety of benchmark statistical techniques arising from survival analysis, which could be applied, to tenure modelling. Tenure prediction will be looked at using survival analysis and compared with "crossbreed" data mining techniques that use multiple regression in concurrence with statistical techniques. It will be demonstrated how data mining tools complement the statistical models, and show that their mutual usage overcomes many of the shortcomings of each singular tool set, resulting in LTV models that are both accurate and comprehensible. Bank XYZ is used as an example and is based on a real scenario of one of the Banks of South Africa.</field><field name="date">2009-11-12T09:23:37Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifetime value</field><field name="subject">Central role</field><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Modelling tenure</field><field name="subject">Data mining tools</field><field name="subject">Statistical techniques</field><field name="subject">Mutual usage</field><field name="subject">Multiple regression</field><field name="subject">Statistical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benchmarking IT service regions / Victoria G.

This study researches and implements best practices that lead to best performance. A customer quality defined standard has to be created by benchmarking the Information Technology Service Regions which may be used to help decision-makers or management make informed decisions about (1) the effectiveness of service systems, (2) managing the performance of Information Technology Service Regions. Waiting lines or queues are an everyday occurrence and may take the form of customers waiting in a restaurant to be serviced or telephone calls waiting to be answered. The model of waiting lines is used to help managers evaluate the effectiveness of service systems. It determines precisely the optimal number of employees that must work at the centralised service desk. A Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is used as a benchmarking tool to locate a frontier which is then used to evaluate the efficiency of each of the organizational units responsible for observed output and input quantities. The inefficient units can learn from the best practice frontier situated along the frontier line.</field><field name="date">2009-11-17T06:21:37Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Research</field><field name="subject">Implement</field><field name="subject">Best practices</field><field name="subject">Study</field><field name="subject">Best performance</field><field name="subject">Benchmarking</field><field name="subject">IT service regions</field><field name="subject">Effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Service systems</field><field name="subject">Managing</field><field name="subject">Data envelopment analysis</field><field name="subject">Methodology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Employees' work outcomes associated with the psychological contract within a service company / by Colette du Plooy</field><field name="creator">Du Plooy, Colette</field><field name="description">During the last decade, dramatic changes have been experienced in workplaces because of technological growth, globalisation, ever increasing competitive markets, changing industrial relation laws and better management skills (Cappelli, 1999). Amidst this change, the biggest issue is for organisations to gain dedication from their employees. Maslach et al (2001) explains that the impact of the changing world of work is perhaps most evident in changes in the psychological contract. Employees are expected to give more in terms of time, effort, skills and flexibility, whereas they receive less in terms of lifetime employment and job security. In security companies, the employer obligations and employee obligations also went through a process of change. Crime has become a very serious concern in South Africa. In Gauteng, crime has increased with 69,2% (SAP Statistics, 2005) from 1994 to 2004. Because of crime, many independent security companies were formed to help prevent crime, working together with the South African Police Force. A lack of research exists regarding employees' work outcomes like job insecurity, organisational commitment and intention to quit associated with the psychological contract within a service company. The objectives of this study are to investigate the relationship between employer obligations, employee obligations, job insecurity, organisational commitment and intention to quit of employees (N=217) in a service (security) company. A cross - sectional design was used. Constructs were measured by means of an employer obligations questionnaire, employee obligations questionnaire, job insecurity questionnaire, organisational commitment questionnaire and intention to quit questionnaire. The research method for each of the two articles consists of a brief literature review and an empirical study. Exploratory factor analysis, as well as Cronbach alpha coefficients are computed to access the reliability and validity of the different measurement instruments. Descriptive statistics are used to analyse data and Pearson product moment correlation coefficients, as well as regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between the constructs employed in this research. Significant differences are found between various biographical groups and the scores of the psychological contract (employer obligations scale and employee obligations scale), the job insecurity scale, the organisational commitment scale and the intention to quit scale. Conclusions are made, limitations of the current research are discussed and recommendations for future research are put forward.</field><field name="date">2009-11-17T06:24:08Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employer obligations</field><field name="subject">Psychological contract</field><field name="subject">Employee obligations</field><field name="subject">Job insecurity</field><field name="subject">Organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">Intention to quit</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of school management teams in human resource management in selected township schools in the Mpumalanga Province / Nhlapo Job Mphikeleli</field><field name="creator">Nhlapo, Job Mphikeleli</field><field name="description">Education in South Africa faces many challenges; among them is the betterment of teaching and learning in order to improve the performance in schools, particularly in township schools where the results of learners are still not up to the required standard. For schools to function effectively, the School Management Teams (Principal, Deputy Principal, HODs), need to understand the importance of the effective management of human resources. The proper and effective management of people cannot be neglected if the schools as organisations want to attain their goals. School Management Teams as managers of schools are accountable for the effective running of the schools and the task of proper management of human resources rest on their shoulders. In this study an investigation into human recource management in selected township schools in the Gert Sibande Region (Mpumalanga Province) was done. Central to the study is the School Management Team's (SMTs) understanding of the concepts management and leadership, human resource management and related aspects. An investigation was also done regarding the knowledge, skills and strategies needed to improve education in township schools. With regard to the proper training of SMTs, various recommendations are made to expose them to more rigorous training, especially in Human Resource Management as this is the cornerstones of effective school management.</field><field name="date">2009-11-17T06:28:12Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investigation</field><field name="subject">Human resource management</field><field name="subject">Township schools</field><field name="subject">Mpumalanga</field><field name="subject">School management teams</field><field name="subject">Concepts</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Leadership</field><field name="subject">Knowledge</field><field name="subject">Skills</field><field name="subject">Strategies</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Recommendations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service delivery and service payment at Emfuleni local municipality / M.

Memorandum is an exceptionally multifaceted text in which various patterns overlap. Any adequate analysis and interpretation of the novel must pay due attention to the comprehensive and variegated processes of meaning generation that are simultaneously active in this very dense text. Given the fact that all themes and motives are kept relevant all the way through, there is a danger that the researcher might get lost and that the argument (s)he produces might become too vague. Therefore this study focuses on only four aspects, which will then also determine the structure of the dissertation: (1) the unusual and complex narrative structure of the text; (2) the wide variety of forms, spheres or dimensions of the representation of spaces; (3) the disseminating intertextual game; and (4) the textual manifestations of liminality, which include liminal persons, situations, processes and the innovative approach and style of the text with regard to the relation between text and paintings. The dissertation attempts to participate in and add to the ongoing conversation between word, image, structure and theory through utilising not only narrative theory and narrative methods (which include the basic theory for studying spaces in literary texts), but also intertextual and liminal theory, in order to add to accepted notions of textual boundaries.</field><field name="date">2009-11-17T09:33:24Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative structure</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Spatial configuration</field><field name="subject">Intertextuality</field><field name="subject">Liminality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The grooming process in child pornography : a social work case study / by Mara Christina Badenhorst</field><field name="creator">Badenhorst, Mara Christina</field><field name="description">This social work research study explore sexual exploitation in the form of child pornography.

Nair</field><field name="creator">Nair, Kishor Krishnan</field><field name="description">Wireless technology has become one of the vital media of communication and Bluetooth is playing a major role in advancing its global spread, connecting electronic devices worldwide without cables. Bluetooth is recognized and globally accepted mainly through Bluetooth enabled mobile phones, which cover almost 60% of the Bluetooth market. However, with other technological innovations, the advancement in Bluetooth enabled mobile phones also caused serious security breaches. Although Bluetooth mobile phones are equipped with built-in security modes and policies, the intruders compromise the mobile phones through existing security vulnerabilities and limitations. Information stored in mobile phones, whether it is personal or corporate, is valuable to mobile phone users. Such information also seeks the attention of intruders. Moreover, an intruder can compromise the mobile phone, and use it as a medium to get into other mobile phones. Mobile phone users are unaware of this current dilemma. Therefore, the need to protect information, as well as mobile phone users to supervise their incoming connections, is very vital. An additional security mechanism was therefore realized, especially at the mobile phone's user level, and which could be useful to the mobile phone users. Bluetooth Logging Agent (BLA) is such a mechanism. It helps in alleviating the current security issues by making the users aware of their incoming Bluetooth connections and giving them an option to either accept or reject these connections. Besides this, the intrusion detection and verification module uses databases and rules to authenticate and verify all connections. The BLA when comparing to the existing security solutions is unique in that; it is equipped with a Bluetooth message logging module. This logging module reduces the security risks by monitoring the Bluetooth communication between the mobile phone and the remote device.</field><field name="date">2009-11-17T10:03:06Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Blood levels of selective antiretroviral drugs over a period of time, in Sprague-Dawley rats / Michael du Plooy</field><field name="creator">Du Plooy, Michael</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.Sc.

The research, more specifically, examines the market awareness of the brand regarding the company versus the product. Monsanto SA, as a company, deals in the market as DEKALB. The study is based on the principles of the Burrows model of corporate identity. A tailor-made questionnaire was used as the measuring instrument. A total of 281 respondents completed the questionnaires. Data analysis was done by means of descriptive statistics and a Varimax rotated factor analysis. The reliability of the data was verified by determining the Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In this investigation, for the brand DEKALB, only one factor contributes to the brand image identified as dynamism. For Monsanto SA, two factors contribute to the organisation image. These factors are identified as dynamism and visual identity. The research concludes that although brand identities are similar to a large extent, the market views Monsanto SA more defined. A second factor is identified in addition to the common factor in both identities. The final and most important conclusion is that dual branding in the marketing strategy influences corporate identity and image, and vice versa. Monsanto SA should, therefore, take care not to confuse the market. Currently, agreement exists between the two identities, but it could easily result in confusion. Marketing strategies of Monsanto SA and DEKALB should purposefully dovetail to ensure that market confusion does not set in.</field><field name="date">2009-11-25T07:00:25Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Dual branding</field><field name="subject">Agricultural sector</field><field name="subject">Market awareness</field><field name="subject">Principles</field><field name="subject">Burrows model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die politieke problematiek en hantering van nie-gevestigde minderhede in Belgi&#235; / M.M. Smit</field><field name="creator">Smit, Maria Magdalena</field><field name="description">Since the end of the Second World War, several phases of migration to West European states have occurred. These migrants consisted of the so called guest workers who were recruited to fill labour shortages, citizens from former colonies who wanted to settle in the colonial empires as well as asylum seekers and refugees. These migrants generally migrated within the network of a certain ethnic group which led to the formation of ethnic groupings in the West European states (so called new ethnic minorities). These ethnic groupings often live segregated from the host population where they experience a lack of cultural, economical and political integration. This lack of integration of the new ethnic minorities often leads to antagonism, lack of understanding, mistrust and sometimes a racist attitude by the host population towards these groups. The development of a collective policy for the management of new ethnic minorities only became priority in the European Union (EU) by the late 1990s. The current policy for the management of new ethnic minorities consists of guidelines and recommendations to member states on the implementation of a own, unique new ethnic minority policy. Although the current Belgian policy for the management of new ethnic minorities adheres to the guidelines and recommendations of the EU, it still has structural problems and gaps. The purpose of this study was foremost to do a descriptive analysis of the protection of established minorities in Belgium. In contrast to and comparison with this, an in depth analysis of the political problem, management and current situation of new ethnic minorities in Belgian was made in order to identify shortcomings in the current policy for the management of new ethnic minorities. This was done through a literature search as well as an empirical study in the form of semi -structured interviews. The general finding was that the Belgian political system makes adequate provision for the protection of established minorities, but not for the protection of new ethnic minorities. In this regard and in conclusion, specific recommendations were made in order to identify and address the current protective measures of new ethnic minorities in Belgium.</field><field name="date">2009-11-25T07:02:11Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Descriptive</field><field name="subject">Analysis</field><field name="subject">Protection</field><field name="subject">Established</field><field name="subject">Minorities</field><field name="subject">Belgium</field><field name="subject">Political problem</field><field name="subject">Management</field><field name="subject">Ethnic</field><field name="subject">Current policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Support needs of primary school educators directly affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic / Monica Nondandiba Ngemntu</field><field name="creator">Ngemntu, Monica Nondandiba</field><field name="description">This study focuses on how the HIV and Aids pandemic affects educators in primary schools and how these educators need to be supported to cope more resiliently with the challenges posed by the HIV/Aids pandemic. This study needed to understand how primary school educators experienced the impact of the HIV/Aids pandemic, both professionally and personally. Educators in general are personally affected by the HIV/Aids pandemic emotionally, physically, spiritually and socially. Affected educators are professionally affected by the HIV/Aids, when they are burdened by a large numbers of orphans in their classes, absenteeism of learners and colleagues, poor performance of both educators and learners, high workload and multiple roles they have to perform. The impacts, both personal and professional, are mostly negative. However, to date no study has focused on the impacts of the pandemic on primary school educators. In this study, a phenomenological design was followed. Interviews were conducted with a carefully recruited sample of participants (i.e. primary school educators affected by the HIV/Aids pandemic either in their families or by having orphans in their classes) in the Vaal Triangle area. The researcher recruited participants by means of snowball sampling. Fifteen affected educators participated in this study. Primary school educators interviewed, noted poor emotional, spiritual, physical and social health. They also reported that they do not cope with their duties as educators effectively. Affected primary school educators are in need of comprehensive support to deal with the HIV/Aids pandemic related stressors from the DoE, SMT's, colleagues and the community at large. Affected educators noted that they need to be supported, by means of team work with colleagues and the community; medical support; amongst others HIV education for learners, educators and parents and practical support and counselling for dealing with difficulties created by the HIV/Aids pandemic.</field><field name="date">2009-11-25T07:50:41Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Affect</field><field name="subject">Educators</field><field name="subject">Primary schools</field><field name="subject">Support</field><field name="subject">Challenges</field><field name="subject">Professionally</field><field name="subject">Personally</field><field name="subject">Vaal Triangle</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complicated grief in the South African context : a therapeutic intervention programme / Cornelia Maria (Nelia) Drenth</field><field name="creator">Drenth, Cornelia Maria</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (Social Work))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009.</field><field name="date">2009-11-26T06:33:45Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complicated grief</field><field name="subject">Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Inventory of traumatic grief</field><field name="subject">Grief assessment guide</field><field name="subject">Complicated grief intervention model</field><field name="subject">Complicated grief intervention programme</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Communication apprehension in Qwaqwa secondary schools / Moshe Moses Malimabe</field><field name="creator">Malimabe, Moshe Moses</field><field name="description">Thesis (MEd (Didactics))--PU for CHE, 1997.</field><field name="date">2009-11-26T06:34:39Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die toerusting van kerklike ampsdraers met betrekking tot krisisberading : 'n verkennende pastorale studie / Gerrit Snyman</field><field name="creator">Snyman, Gerrit</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.A. (Pastoral))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009.</field><field name="date">2009-11-26T06:36:17Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crisis</field><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="subject">Counseling</field><field name="subject">Congregation</field><field name="subject">Equipment</field><field name="subject">Training</field><field name="subject">Pastorate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An African face of Christianity : a theology of five African initiated churches in Botswana / Keikanetswe E.

Of the solid waste that is generated, 50% is recyclable while only 10% is recycled (SOER, 2003: 69). Solid waste recycling is mainly performed through private sector initiatives in the City of Johannesburg. Consequently, there is no proper coordination with government initiatives. In order for South Africa to increase and sustain economic growth that would decrease unemployment, there should be a culture of entrepreneurship (Mass, G &amp; Herrington M, 2006:7). Solid waste buy-back centres assist in addressing the challenges of dealing with the increased generation of solid waste and the scarcity of land for disposal. These centres also reduce the challenges of unemployment through promoting entrepreneurs to operate solid waste recycling businesses. Developed economies have managed to increase the rate of solid waste recycling to 60%. The problems associated with solid waste have been reduced by promoting recycling through a combination of legislation and setting-up of agencies to deal with solid waste recycling. South Africa has legislation and stated programmes to deal with solid waste recycling. Nevertheless, there has been complexity with implementing recycling. This is the result of a lack of           co-ordination between the role-players involved in the value chain of solid waste recycling. In order for the City of Johannesburg to increase the recycling of solid waste from 10% to optimal rates of between 50% and 60%, there should be      co-ordination of programmes amongst all the role players. In addition, there should also be skills provision to existing and potential entrepreneurs operating the solid waste buy-back centres. All spheres of government should promote solid waste recycling business to potential entrepreneurs and the public in order to recycle 40% of the recyclable solid waste that is not being recycled. The establishment of a solid waste buy-back centre in the City of Johannesburg is economically viable with some buy-back centre realising a net-profit of least     R5 000 and some more than R30 000 per month. In order for the solid waste buy-back centre to realise a net-profit of more than R30 000 per month, there must be more than 40 tons of recyclable solid waste received by the buy-back centre per month. This study has indicated that solid waste buy-back centres rely on the economies of scale. This means that the more recyclable solid waste is received and sold by the solid waste buy-back centres, the more profitable it becomes.</field><field name="date">2009-11-27T05:50:49Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solid waste</field><field name="subject">Buy - back centre</field><field name="subject">Recycling</field><field name="subject">City of Johannesburg</field><field name="subject">Viability</field><field name="subject">Establishing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die georganiseerde kultuurlewe van die blanke gemeenskap van Vanderbijlpark in die tydperk 1942-1992 / A.M.M.

Niemann</field><field name="creator">Niemann, Andries Christiaan</field><field name="description">Active magnetic bearings (AMBs) have become a key technology in industrial applications with a continued drive for cost reduction and an increase in reliability. AMBs require position feedback to suspend the rotor. Conventional contactless position sensors are used to measure the rotor's position. The major disadvantages of conventional position sensors are their cost and that the sensors are viewed as a weak point in an AMB system. A self-sensing sensor is a type of sensor which is cost effective, reduces sensor wire-length and increases reliability, thus ideal for the industry. This type of sensor relies on the current and voltage signals of the AMB's to obtain the rotor position. Due to the rapid and advanced development of digital electronics, it has become more powerful and cheaper, thus self-sensing in mass production will be cost effective. Different self-sensing approaches were developed in the past and can be divided into two main categories: state estimation and amplitude modulation approaches. In this research the focus will be on the amplitude modulation approach. Amplitude modulation makes use of two signals, namely the modulation signal and the carrier signal. In a self-sensing AMB system the carrier can be a high frequency component injected into the system or the switching ripple of the switch mode power amplifier can be used. The modulation signal is the change in rotor position which results in changing inductances. The actuator material introduces nonlinear effects on the estimated position. Due to these nonlinear effects, it is rather difficult to obtain the rotor position. The first industrial application of a self-sensing turbomolecular pump system was implemented in 2005 by S2M. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate existing self-sensing schemes, devise improvements and investigate possible new schemes. Four different demodulation methods and two new self-sensing schemes are evaluated. An AMB transient simulation model which includes saturation, hysteresis, eddy currents and cross-coupling is used to evaluate the schemes in simulation. The self-sensing schemes are implemented in hardware and evaluated on a 7 A rms 500 N AMB. A comparative study was done on the different self-sensing schemes. From the comparative study it was determined that the gain- and phase effects have a direct effect on the sensitivity of the system. It was also proved that self-sensing can be implemented on a coupled AMB with a sensitivity of 10.3 dB.</field><field name="date">2009-12-07T06:26:03Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Self-sensing</field><field name="subject">Sensorless sensor</field><field name="subject">Demodulation</field><field name="subject">AMB</field><field name="subject">Inductive sensing</field><field name="subject">Bi-state switched mode power amplifier</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between internal value drivers and shareholder value : JSE listed mining companies investigated / A. Gerber</field><field name="creator">Gerber, Anton</field><field name="description">The primary goal of a publicly traded company is to maximise the wealth of its shareholders. This implies that the management of the firm, as agents of the owners, has to manage the firm in such a manner as to create value from every decision taken. Value-based management (VBM) is a management strategy aimed at achieving shareholder wealth creation and is based on the effective management of a set of internal value drivers to maximise wealth creation. The primary objective of the current study is to investigate the quantification of the relationship between internal value drivers and shareholder wealth creation in the Mining sector of JSE listed companies in South Africa. In order to achieve this, the internal value drivers were identified from literature, the necessary financial data was collected and the value drivers as well as actual shareholder wealth were quantified. Revenue growth, operating profitability, capital requirements and weighted average cost of capital (WACC) were identified as the value drivers while total shareholder return (TSR) was identified as the actual shareholder wealth creator. For the purpose of the current study, WACC was excluded from the analysis. By application of linear regression, it was found that revenue growth and operating profitability have a positive, statistically significant effect of TSR. After analysing the effect size, it is however concluded that the effect is not practically significant. These findings concur with similar research in the field of VBM.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15T05:42:54Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Relationship</field><field name="subject">Internal value drivers</field><field name="subject">Shareholder value</field><field name="subject">JSE listed</field><field name="subject">Mining companies</field><field name="subject">Investigate</field><field name="subject">Quantification</field><field name="subject">Wealth creation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementing productivity gainsharing to influence the performance of value drivers employed by EVA / Jakobus Eduard Wessels Fivaz</field><field name="creator">Fivaz, Jakobus Eduard Wessels</field><field name="description">The creation of shareholder wealth has become the key of corporate success. A setback in achieving this is a lack of commitment and participation in productivity initiatives at shop floor level in South Africa and companies are faced with competitive challenges of promoting innovativeness relating to productivity improvement amongst employees. It has increasingly been recognized that by introducing a carefully crafted incentive scheme, it may be possible to induce workers to work both harder and smarter and use existing technologies in new and better ways that enhance their productivity. The purpose of the study is to evaluate to what extend gainsharing can be a solution to the predicament. The empirical data used during the study was based on questionnaires that were administered amongst managers of Eskort Ltd. The research established that gainsharing would induce employees to effectively participate in problem solving or productivity improvement initiatives in the company. The majority of participants feel that gainsharing will benefit the company to deliver on client requirements; help enhance teamwork; create a feeling of ownership; share a portion of saved-cost for productivity improvement purposes; stimulate organization learning; improve communication between management and employees; stimulate employees to make suggestions on ways to improve productivity; and increase profit and reduce costs. The study clearly illustrates that money can be the primary drive for motivation to certain employees within the company. Further more based on the results of the empirical study the researcher came to the conclusion that motivated employees will be more productive and as a result have a positive influence on the value drivers employed by the EVA methodology. EVA is a value based performance measure, an investment decision tool and also a performance measure indicating the absolute amount of shareholder value created.</field><field name="date">2009-12-15T05:43:19Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gainsharing</field><field name="subject">Economic value added</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die impak van 'n wildernisekspedisie op persoonlike en groepseffektiwiteit tydens 'n spanbouprogram / Gustav Greffrath</field><field name="creator">Greffrath, Gustav Carl</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.A. (Recreation Science))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006.</field><field name="date">2008-08-25T22:05:47Z</field><field name="language">Afrikaans</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Outdoor management development</field><field name="subject">Outdoor experiential education</field><field name="subject">Wilderness - Expedition</field><field name="subject">Personal effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Group effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Team building</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/27</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Kierkegaardian-existentialist critique of pragmatic communication on HIV/AIDS, with respect to selected Ikageng residents / C.T.

The literature review revealed that the local churches as they exist today are in disrepute. Together with other societal institutions, they are suspect, distrusted and no longer accepted at face value. Moreover, different societies or associations of Christians are found claiming to themselves and denying to others, the character and privilege of a Christian church; and opinions widely differing from each other are held as to the meaning of the word Church. In our time the word church has assumed various contemporary uses: the place of worship, a particular denomination, an area or nation, the universal body of believers, a local group of believers. Recourse to Scriptures must be sought for ecclesiastical formulations. The contextual study has revealed that the Vaal Triangle is characterised by differences in ethnic origin, language, and religion. Another feature about the Vaal Triangle is that some families are religiously bi-cultural i.e., members of the same family unit belong to different religious persuasions. In other instances the members of the same family unit belong to different denominations. This difference in church affiliation is as a result of various (and often confusing) church practices in the area. Moreover, there are a number of groups in existence in the Vaal Triangle called 'the Church' but certainly are not what the Lord said he would build, nor do they measure up to what the New Testament means when it speaks of the Church. This study endeavours to think afresh biblically and theologically, about the nature, structure and dynamics of the Local Church in the Vaal Triangle. The model proposed in this study namely, the Pastoral Family Model (PFM) seeks to integrate the whole life and witness of the Local Church in a balanced and co-ordinated way. This model uses all members of the household of God who can contribute to the growth of the Local Church by penetrating the community in other ways.</field><field name="date">2010-03-04T10:40:01Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Appropriate model</field><field name="subject">Local church</field><field name="subject">Vaal Triangle</field><field name="subject">Bible</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Quantitative</field><field name="subject">Church-growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model to improve the implementation of portfolio assessment / Matsiliso Mary Tlokotsi</field><field name="creator">Tlokotsi, Matsiliso Mary</field><field name="description">In South African classrooms a strong emphasis is placed on assessing learners by means of portfolios. Through the utilisation of portfolios it is envisaged that learner growth and development should be enhanced in order for learners to become expert learners who are strategic, self-regulated and self-reflecting. This study aimed to determine how effective the implementation of portfolio assessment presently is, and if necessary, to develop a model that could improve the implementation of portfolio assessment in the Senior Phase, Grade 9 in particular. By means of explanatory mixed method research through the completion of questionnaires by 369 learners and 88 educators, and focus group interviews conducted with 36 of the 88 educators from the Sedibeng West District, disconcerting results were revealed. It appeared that educators are not equipped with adequate knowledge and skills to implement portfolio assessment in order to enhance learner growth and development. Based on the disturbing findings, a model was designed to highlight the processes and components involved in the successful implementation of portfolio assessment. As no evidence of any other model to improve the implementation of portfolio assessment at school level could be located, the contribution of this study lies in the development of a tool that could be utilized by the Department of Education to train educators to become effective implementers of portfolio assessment.</field><field name="date">2010-03-04T10:41:24Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Model</field><field name="subject">Improve</field><field name="subject">Implementation</field><field name="subject">Portfolio</field><field name="subject">Assessment</field><field name="subject">Determine</field><field name="subject">Effective</field><field name="subject">Senior phase</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Support needs of high school educators directly affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic / L.I.E. Serero</field><field name="creator">Serero, Lebogang Ivy Esther</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the impact of HIV/Aids on secondary school educators who are affected by the HIV/Aids pandemic. The study seeks to understand how the pandemic has impacted on educators and identify support needs of educators affected by HIV/Aids. Many educators are negatively affected by HIV/Aids due to the fact that their family members, loved ones, friends, learners and colleagues may be ill, dying or affected by HIV and Aids. Educators are personally and professionally affected by HIV/Aids. Personally many educators are emotionally, socially, spiritually and physically affected. Professionally many are negatively impacted as educator absenteeism rises, morale is lowered and professional roles become more complex. There are very few avenues of support for educators who are affected by the HIV pandemic. To determine how high school educators are affected and what their subsequent support needs are, this study followed a phenomenological design. Fourteen high school educators were interviewed. All participants taught at township schools in the Free State and were affected by the HIV pandemic. The data were coded with regard to how these educators were affected by the pandemic and what support they wished for. According to this study's findings, educators in township secondary schools in the Free State are personally and professionally affected. Their experiences are mostly negative. They wish for support from the Department of Education, school management, their colleagues and the community. Examples of requested support include training and counselling programmes, supportive attitudes and additional educators so that they might be assisted to cope with the HIV/Aids pandemic challenges.</field><field name="date">2010-03-04T10:45:39Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Impact</field><field name="subject">HIV/Aids</field><field name="subject">Secondary school</field><field name="subject">Educators</field><field name="subject">Affected</field><field name="subject">Support needs</field><field name="subject">Personally</field><field name="subject">Professionally</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medium of instruction as determinant of student throughput at the Vaal University of Technology / Magdalena Rynette Erasmus</field><field name="creator">Erasmus, Magdalena Rynette</field><field name="description">This research study deals mainly with the influence of the medium of instruction on throughput at the Vaal University of Technology. The underlying hypothesis driving this research, is that learners at the Vaal University of Technology will tend to underachieve during their period of study, largely because the medium of instruction and assessment is not their first language, but a second or even a third language. The assertion is that learners on tertiary level can only perform academically well if they have gained a certain level of competency in their mother tongue, to ease the difficult process of acquiring the second language English, which is the main medium of instruction at the VUT. For most human beings language is the medium through which knowledge is transferred or negotiated. The success of this interaction is determined by the effectiveness of communication. Thus it would be fair to say, that if the means of communication is inappropriate, there will be little or no language transfer. Further, it seems logical that before any other considerations are made with regard to teaching and learning, the instrument which enables this interaction should first be in place. The research aims are: to determine the influence of a second language as medium of instruction on academic performance, to establish the nature of the support system which might facilitate the advancement of learners not prepared for the academic demands of university, to determine what can be done to address the problem and provide possible recommendations for improved academic performance. In order to attain the abovementioned research aims, a literature review and an empirical investigation were undertaken. The literature study discussed the role which the medium of instruction has played in the history of South African Education. The South African Language Policy, before and after 1994, was then reviewed. Parent and learner choice in respect of the choice of medium of instruction was then considered. The findings of the empirical study have shown that the medium of instruction has a remarkable influence on learners' proficiency and eventual performance in their content subjects. The empirical research was conducted by using a questionnaire in order to obtain data on relevant variables as indicated by the literature study, as well as identify barriers perceived by students that hamper their academic progress. Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, were used to summarize the data. Marks from the compulsory language test at the institution were also taken into account in order to establish learners' English language proficiency. This data, together with students' marks, were interpreted in the empirical analysis. The target population for this study consisted of L1 and L2 students who registered in 2004 and will have completed their studies in 2006, as well as students having completed in 2007. The population consisted of both female and male students from the Faculty of Visual Arts and Design. In the last chapter, Chapter 6, conclusions from the literature review and empirical investigation were drawn. Recommendations for further research were provided which stressed the need for developing an appropriate training course for L2MI (Second Language Medium of Instruction) content subject teachers. Effective training in L2MI is one of the most important factors in improving the level of academic literacy in South African learners.</field><field name="date">2010-03-04T10:50:25Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic performance</field><field name="subject">Mother tongue learner</field><field name="subject">Mother tongue speaker</field><field name="subject">First language speaker</field><field name="subject">English second language</field><field name="subject">Pass rate</field><field name="subject">Results</field><field name="subject">Influence</field><field name="subject">Effect</field><field name="subject">Medium of instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single mothers empowerment through small business development projects in Gweru, Zimbabwe : the case of the GWAPA Poverty Alleviation Programme / Maxwell Constantine Chando Musingafi</field><field name="creator">Musingafi, Maxwell</field><field name="description">This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the GWAPA Single Mothers Poverty alleviation Programme. The study hypothesized that women in Gweru are among the most vulnerable to poverty and disease and GWAPA project may be an effective source to their poverty alleviation. Main objectives of the study were to explain selected development concepts, to explore the relationship between gender and poverty, to investigate the effectiveness of the GWAPA Programme, to outline the challenges faced by GWAPA, and to offer recommendations based on research findings to help improve the effectiveness of the programme. Both theoretical study and empirical research methods were used to ensure a balanced evaluation of the problem. The theoretical study established that the target population for poverty alleviation and development programmes must be fully involved for development to replace poverty. On average women were found to be poorer than men and hence the need for projects that focus on poverty alleviation among women. In the empirical study 375 of the 1756 GWAPA single women members were used as questionnaire respondents, and 3 management employees were sampled for the interviews. Descriptive survey and qualitative participatory approaches were used as the main research methodologies. This hybrid approach was intended to improve the validity and reliability of the outcome of the study by mitigating weaknesses of different individual approaches. This approach would ensure maximum utilization and involvement of subjects and available resources. Questionnaires, interviews and documentary evidence augmented by the researcher's experience with the NGDO were used as research instruments. Of the 375 Questionnaires distributed, 357 (95%) were collected. Various statistical measures were used to summarize and interpret the data, particularly tables, graphs and charts, actual frequencies and percentage rates. Narrative descriptions were also used to explain given scenarios and relationships. The study established that poverty and development are multidimensional concepts, families headed by women are on average poorer than those headed by men, respondents' lives have changed for the better, GWAPA single mothers have work overload especially considering that as women they shoulder the biggest chunk of the family responsibilities, and most of the GWAPA projects which started well were now suffocating under the current economic hardships.. Main challenges faced by GWAPA include the current political and economic environment, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the limited educational levels among its members, members' limited access to resources, community cultural biases and negative attitudes towards single mothers and commercial sex workers, government regulation on financial transactions and the amount of cash one should hold outside the banking system, and work overload among members. The study recommends involvement of GWAPA members' opposite sex partners as affiliates, intensive public campaigns, lobbying and advocacy to remove the stigma and negative attitudes towards single mothers and commercial sex workers, improving infrastructure and the GWAPA Farm operations, engaging long term facilitators, certification after attending training programmes, excelling awards, present manuals in mother languages, and alternative fundraising strategies. The government and municipalities are encouraged to invest more in the small enterprise sector as it has proven to have the capability to create employment and develop communities by mobilizing the grassroots. The study also recommends a more detailed and deeper participatory study, related comparative studies that show differences and similarities between related projects in different areas in Zimbabwe, and similar studies on DNGOs that work with both sexes in different areas in Zimbabwe.</field><field name="date">2010-03-04T10:51:04Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Capacity building</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Empowerment</field><field name="subject">Poverty alleviation</field><field name="subject">AIDS/HIV</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Single mothers</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Small business management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medicine usage patterns in a district hospital : a therapeutic budget model approach / Margaritha Johanna Eksteen.

The primary objective was the identification of the dominant and secondary filamentous organisms. Other important criteria included were the floe character, diversity, filament index (Fl) and identification of the protozoan and metazoan communities. The operational data determined from routine analyses of the sludge, influent and effluent were used to assess the relationship of the filamentous population to wastewater characteristics and to compare this with previous findings. Fl values of &gt;3 and dissolved sludge volume indices (DSVI's) of &gt;150 were chosen as representing the possibility of bulking conditions being present. The five most prevalent dominant filaments were Type 0092, Type 1851, actinomycetes, Microthrix parvicella and Type 021N, being present in 74%, 31%, 22%, 17% and 14% of samples respectively. Type 0092 did not appear to be associated with bulking in any of the WWTP's, although it was often incidentally present as a co-dominant species when bulking conditions existed. All three WWTP's with the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration harboured Type 1851 as the major dominant species, irrespective of whether the plants treated domestic or industrial effluent. Conditions suggestive of bulking were present in two of these WWTP's. Contrary to expectations, Type 1851 was often found as a dominant species where domestic waste was the primary influent. Type 021N and actinomycetes were strongly implicated when bulking occurred. The overgrowth of these filaments appeared to be related to factors such as nutrient deficiency (Type 021N) or the presence of large amounts of low molecular weight substances in the influent. Microthrix parvicella did not cause major bulking problems. There was a strong association between low levels of nitrates/nitrites in the clarifier supernatant and good phosphorous removal, irrespective of the configuration of the WWTP. The converse was also true.</field><field name="date">2010-05-11T10:07:45Z</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microscopic analysis</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Filamentous organisms</field><field name="subject">Operational data</field><field name="subject">Bulking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/2982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pastoraat aan die Afrika-mens / Johan Bosman</field><field name="creator">Bosman, Johan</field><field name="description">Thesis (Th.M.

There are many risks that occur when adolescents are faced with divorce. Of late research has suggested that parental divorce is an increasingly common phenomenon in black families, but there is no literature which focuses on what contributes to black adolescents coping resiliently with their parents' divorce. The purpose of this study was to provide answers, by means of a literature review and empirical research, to what the antecedents of resilience are among black adolescents coping resiliently with their parents divorce. This was achieved by using a qualitative phenomenological design: ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with resilient black adolescents coping well with their parents' divorce. This study makes a contribution to theory because it suggests a new resilience -promoting resource for black youth from divorced homes, namely dedicated support from friends and teachers (support that is 'always' available), not noted in previous resilience studies. This study also contributed to theory by confirming that resilience promoting processes such as community-facilitated spaces (hostel residence), extra-curricular activities at school and cultural rites encourage resilience among youth whose parents are divorced. This has not been noted in previous literature studies. The findings of this study were used to draft recommendations for Life Orientation teachers on how to encourage resilience among black South African adolescents coping with the adversities of their parents' divorce. In so doing my study made a potential contribution to practice.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:26:07Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Black adolescent</field><field name="subject">Divorce</field><field name="subject">Risk</field><field name="subject">Protective</field><field name="subject">Factors</field><field name="subject">Processes</field><field name="subject">Cultural rites</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community participation in waste minimization : the case of Emfuleni Local Municipality / Nompazamo Alma Ludidi</field><field name="creator">Ludidi, Nompazamo Alma</field><field name="description">The purpose of this research is to understand factors contributing to successes and challenges in community participation especially in waste minimization initiatives; in order to inform policies and contribute to improve the design of the initiative. The objectives of the research are: firstly, to understand the current state of public participation in waste minimization at Emfuleni Local Municipality. Secondly, it is to determine the extent of willingness of the community to participate in waste minimization initiatives. Thirdly, to determine strategies on how to promote public participation in waste minimization. Fourthly, to identify constraints and challenges of public participation in waste minimization and what kind of support is required for the community to participate in waste minimization initiatives at Emfuleni Local Municipality. Respondents were drawn from fifty households within the community of Bophelong Extension 13, Emfuleni Recycling groups, Waste Management officials, Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment stake holder participation unit and Waste Buyers in Vanderbijlpark. The researcher employed mainly a qualitative research design and data was collected through questionnaires and interviews. Quantitative study was done on officials and responses were ranked according to the importance of the factors influencing community participation. The findings of this research indicate that the community is willing to participate in waste minimization initiatives. 42% of respondents are currently NOT participating in waste minimization initiatives. It was noted that all community respondents promised and are willing to participate in waste minimization strategies. The research further indicates that there is a considerable number of constraints and challenges prohibiting successful community participation in waste minimization. The constraints include lack of knowledge especially regarding composting initiatives to minimize organic waste and the separation of waste, lack of infrastructure to exchange waste for cash, lack of time, lack of transport, lack of political support, lack of starter packs to initiate own waste minimization plant and lack of financial support to ensure that waste minimization initiatives create opportunities for job creation. This study recommends, amongst others, that the community requires support to participate meaningfully in waste minimization initiatives in the form of: awareness and education, infrastructure for reclaimed waste, waste recycling bins, project funding, community involvement and support from the Emfuleni Local Municipality and the private sector.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:27:25Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Participation</field><field name="subject">Waste minimization</field><field name="subject">Emfuleni Local Municipality</field><field name="subject">Initiatives</field><field name="subject">Factors</field><field name="subject">Contributing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3091</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public sector procurement as strategic tool for black economic empowerment at Sedibeng District Municipality / Paulos Moeketsi Motsiri</field><field name="creator">Motsiri, Paulos Moeketsi</field><field name="description">The central objective of this study was to establish the extent to which public procurement, as applied at Sedibeng District Municipality, contributes to the development of designated suppliers. Previously, procurement was considered just another function of government responsible for purchasing and receiving goods. Currently, procurement is considered a strategic function that can be utilized by government to achieve certain policy objectives, such as Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and Local Economic Development (LED).If implemented properly, without favoritism, nepotism and corruption, public sector procurement will promote the empowerment of designated groups. In this way, it will address   socio-economic imbalances of the past. The study's hypothesis implied that Sedibeng District Municipality has laudable objectives to promote black economic empowerment through procurement. However, the implementation procedures and processes showed considerable constraints. Academic literature and government procurement documents were reviewed; and interviews were conducted at Sedibeng municipal area. The literature study was based on best procurement practices both in government and private sector. Empirical research was conducted on Sedibeng District Municipality's procurement unit practices, Small, Medium and Micro Enterprise development and the benefits of procurement to designated suppliers. The purpose was to determine the role that procurement policies play in promoting black economic empowerment. Eventually, a number of models and systems were recommended to improve procurement policies and procedures at Sedibeng District Municipality. These methods include: Management Assessment System; Realistic Objectives System; Departmental Evaluation Plan; Contract Progress Report Form; and Checklists. In the view of the researcher, a combination of these methods can assist to improve procurement policies and procedures.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:27:55Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public sector</field><field name="subject">Procurement</field><field name="subject">Strategic tool</field><field name="subject">Black economic empowerment</field><field name="subject">Sedibeng District Municipality</field><field name="subject">Designated suppliers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A workplace skills plan for enhanced service delivery at Nigel Local Municipality / Easter Ballies</field><field name="creator">Ballies, Easter</field><field name="description">The importance of human resource development as a means of ensuring that the organisation and institution maintain their competitiveness cannot be over-emphasised. Training and development of employees are critical to organisations, because it ensures the acquisition of required skills, which is paramount for the provision of effective service delivery, in particular local sphere of government. The Workplace Skills training that refers to the strategic human resource training and development, aims at developing the workforce, labour skills capacity, thereby achieving the institutional goals, policies and objectives of the institution. The Workplace Skills Plan is the key strategic planning document relating to workplace training, career pathing and employment equity for the Municipality. It details the training planned by a municipality in a given financial year as legislated by the Local Government Sector Education Training Authority (LGSETA). Workplace Skills Plan, through LGSETA, the Skills Development Legislative framework and the Employment Equity Act, makes provision, ensuring that employees in the public service should enhance their skills in order to deliver effective services to its customers, the public. For quality and effective service delivery at the Nigel Local Municipality to take place, the implementation of the Workplace Skills training is imperative for the enhancement of a skill workforce that will be able to ensure that the customer is satisfied with the product and service rendered by the employees.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:29:00Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workplace Skills Plan</field><field name="subject">Enhanced</field><field name="subject">Service</field><field name="subject">Delivery</field><field name="subject">Nigel Local Municipality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors which contribute to resilience amongst poor, second-language learners / M.F. Cronje</field><field name="creator">Cronje, Magdalena Francina</field><field name="description">The focus of this empirical study was on the antecedents of resilience among poor, English second-language (ESL) adolescent learners. The reasons why some adolescents in this situation are resilient and others are not, are indicated in this study. Adolescents qualify as being resilient if they are exposed to significant threat to their development, indicating high risk to the individual, and their adaptation to the threat is successful, due to support, resources or intervention. Thirty three resilient and 32 non -resilient poor, ESL adolescent learners were selected to participate in the empirical study. My study was a mixed method study because I made use of quantitative research (a survey questionnaire completed by the 65 selected learners), and qualitative research    (semi-structured interviews with two identified resilient learners and a group interview with elders who are knowledgeable about young people in this community). The conclusions of my study emphasise that dynamic interactions between individual attributes, familial support, community resources, and cultural ties empower some adolescents to overcome hardships and be resilient. My findings are supported by literature. My findings cannot be generalised, as the adolescents in my study were all black, South African youth from an impoverished community in the Vaal Triangle. This is an explorative study, and themes that were identified as contributing to resilience in my study, need to be explored in future studies.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:29:51Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">Second-language learning</field><field name="subject">Adolescent</field><field name="subject">Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Protective factors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing entrepreneurial and marketing development skills for small tourism enterprises in the Vaal Triangle region / Natasha de Klerk</field><field name="creator">De Klerk, Natasha</field><field name="description">Increasing unemployment and low economic growth are of growing concern in the world economy and a recognised intervention to combat these challenges is entrepreneurship. Tourism has been acknowledged as an underexploited sector with considerable potential for addressing these challenges. In order to advance entrepreneurial activity, it is essential for students to possess the necessary entrepreneurial skills. However, the absence of consensus on the content of training courses and curricula is currently a concern in the field of entrepreneurship. South African higher education institutions need to redefine their roles and academics should take heed, and ensure that the curricula that they provide correspond with the requirements of practitioners. Through analysing the development skills of successful entrepreneurs, the focus of training courses and curricula can be established. This study constitutes exploratory research into an important issue facing many higher education institutions today and is supported by a detailed literature review and an empirical study. Higher education institutions have to remain competitive due to the turbulent and changeable environment within which they operate. The literature review, in accordance with the scope and limitations of the study, concentrated on the principles of tourism management, together with the entrepreneurial and marketing development skills essential to tourism entrepreneurs. For the empirical part of the study, a self-administered questionnaire was sent to a sample of tourism enterprise owners, tourism management academics and tourism management students. The objective was to develop a set of guidelines for the content of the entrepreneurship and marketing subjects for tourism management students. The research findings provide a balanced view in that they incorporate the perceptions of tourism enterprise owners, tourism management academics and tourism management students. The skills analysed within this study, together with the suggested implementation method, can be used to guide the structured integration of the development of these skills into tourism management programmes. The intention of the study was to cover a wide range of entrepreneurial and marketing development skills essential for the tourism entrepreneur, so that a clear set of skills could be formulated for the recommended inclusion into the content of tourism entrepreneurship and marketing curricula.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:31:16Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entrepreneurial development skills</field><field name="subject">Marketing development skills</field><field name="subject">Tourism management</field><field name="subject">Services marketing</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The phenomenon of resilience among adolescents with learning difficulties in the Vaal Triangle area / by J.M. Palmer</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jolene Maeve</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to document, by means of a literature review and empirical research, the phenomenon of resilience among adolescents with learning difficulties (LD). My study was motivated by a gap in current literature. Although there are some South African studies that explore the personal antecedents of resilience in youth with LD, there were almost no studies explaining what interpersonal antecedents might contribute to resilience. The aim of the empirical study was to investigate the phenomenon of resilience among adolescent learners coping with LD. This was done by conducting phenomenological research with ten learners who have LD and attend a school for learners with special learning needs. The findings of the study are in accordance with previous studies that suggest that resilience is encouraged by dynamic processes that are both interpersonal and intrapersonal. This study makes a contribution to theory in that it suggests that resilience among adolescent learners with LD is also encouraged by their home environment and the positive relationship with siblings that might be brought on by parents treating all their children impartially. This has not been noted in previous studies. This study also raises questions about whether inclusion of all learners in mainstream schools are beneficial to learners with LD. Because my study identified interpersonal processes (unconditional acceptance, safe spaces, championship and pedagogical expertise) that promoted resilience among those participants who took part in my study, my study contributes to what was understood about the process of resilience in learners with LD and in so doing contributes to practice in that guidelines could be drafted for Life Orientation teachers based on the findings of this study. These guidelines can enable dedicated teachers to adapt their classroom environment so that a learner with LD can benefit.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:31:53Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Learning difficulties</field><field name="subject">Protective and risk processes</field><field name="subject">Impact</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of primary school language teachers' teaching methods to enhance critical thinking skills of ESL learners / Chrizelle Wright</field><field name="creator">Wright, Chrizelle</field><field name="description">This study was undertaken in the Johannesburg South district (D11). Primary school language teachers in this district (D11) were invited to participate in this study by means of a questionnaire. This study investigated which kind of teaching methods teachers are currently using to develop and enhance critical thinking skills of ESL learners in language classrooms. Teachers' knowledge of Blooms' Taxonomy of cognitive objectives and how to use this taxonomy to develop ESL learners' critical thinking skills were also scrutinized. Since many ESL learners' language proficiency in English is also limited the responses of the teachers indicated that this could have a negative influence on their critical thinking development. This study accentuates the need for the use of a variety of teaching methods to enhance ESL learners' critical thinking skills in language in the Johannesburg South District (D11).</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:32:58Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Primary school</field><field name="subject">Language teachers</field><field name="subject">Teaching methods</field><field name="subject">Enhance</field><field name="subject">Critical thinking skills</field><field name="subject">ESL learners</field><field name="subject">Johannesburg South District</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empowerment approach to parental involvement in the primary school / Tshabalala Maramane Monica</field><field name="creator">Tshabalala, Maramane Monica</field><field name="description">Parental involvement in education is accepted as an important aspect of learner academic achievement. In fact, there is research evidence that associates high learner achievement with high rates of parental involvement. However, judging by the poor levels of achievement attained by learners in, for instance, areas like reading, writing and numeracy in primary school grades, the question rises as to whether parental involvement is consciously promoted in primary schools. This empirical research intended to investigate how parental involvement is currently promoted in primary schools. The literature review revealed the basic obligations of schools and parents as expressed in Epstein's six typologies of parental involvement, which form the basis of all endeavours towards enhancing parental involvement. Consequently, it is concluded that strategies or programmes aimed at promoting parental involvement, must embody parenting, communication, volunteering, learning at home, participation in decision-making and collaboration with the community. In this regard, the child's environment should be regarded as an ecology consisting of the school, home and community. The main empirical research finding indicates generally, that the meaning attached to parental involvement falls short of its essence, and focuses on response activities from both school staff and parents. The main recommendation, therefore, is advocacy that begins with empowering all stakeholders with regard to the essence of parental involvement. In this regard, the Empowerment Approach to Parental Involvement (EAPI) recommended in this research, proposes a model that empowers individual schools and the community, through a school-based and cluster-based focus. The EAPI model presents a series of actions leading to a modus operandi that recognises the power of zenzele (do it yourself) for schools and parents, and masakhane (doing it for ourselves together) for school clusters and the community. Both concepts utilise principles based on ubuntu and express the adage: "it takes a village to raise a child."</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:34:45Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Empowerment</field><field name="subject">Approach</field><field name="subject">Parental</field><field name="subject">Involvement</field><field name="subject">Primary</field><field name="subject">School</field><field name="subject">Promoted</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exchange rate risks in trade and investment between South Africa and the developed countries / by Cui Zhang</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Cui</field><field name="description">The current international monetary system is very different from that of a few decades ago. Many of the old restrictions that had been placed on currency and capital movements between countries have fallen away in favour of a much more liberal international payment and investment system. The global financial arena is now characterized by greater currency instability, volatility and heightened financial risks. Exchange Rate risk is one of the complex topics in the economic world. Since there are so many factors in the financial market that influence a country's currency value, it becomes very risky for importers, exporters and portfolio investors to be involved in the international trade and financial markets. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding on how the major economic indicators have an impact on the decision-making of the importers, the exporters and investors, to further influence the volatility of the Rand; and to provide various hedging and arbitraging strategies to reduce foreign exchange rate risks. The layout of the study is based on six chapters. Chapter 1 focuses on the background and scope of the study, mainly explaining the reasons, objectives and methodology of this study. An historical overview takes place in chapter 2, where a number of different exchange rate systems will be discussed. Chapter 3 reviews different exchange rate theories in order to support the empirical study in the next chapter. Chapter 4 focuses on an investigation and comparative study on how foreign investments and trade with developed countries have an impact on currency values and visa-versa. A number of management strategies for reducing exchange rate risks are introduced in chapter 5. Chapter 6 is the summary and conclusion of the research.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:35:06Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exchange rate</field><field name="subject">Risks</field><field name="subject">Trade</field><field name="subject">Investment</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Developed countries</field><field name="subject">Economic</field><field name="subject">Indicators</field><field name="subject">Impact</field><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Importers</field><field name="subject">Exporters</field><field name="subject">Investors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ecosystemic approach to supporting learners orphaned by HIV/AIDS / Ntombizodwa Nxusa</field><field name="creator">Nxusa, Ntombizodwa</field><field name="description">The aims of this research about learners affected or orphaned by HIV/AIDS was to determine, by means of a case study, the psychological well-being of learners affected or orphaned by HIV/AIDS; the general performance of these learners at school; the nature and extent of social support they get from their schools, family, community and society; and the physical well-being of these learners; as well as to make suggestions for an ecosystemic psycho-social support of these learners in order to enhance and strengthen their psycho-social well-being. The literature review highlighted that, as a result of HIV/AIDS, new family forms are emerging, such as "skipgeneration" families, where the parent generation has succumbed to HIV/AIDS and HIV/AIDS-related illnesses and the families are made up of grandparents and orphaned grandchildren, and child-headed families, where grandparents are not available to care for orphaned grandchildren. The case study of this research revealed that parental illness and the death of parents of adolescents affected and orphaned by HIV/AIDS are causes of these adolescents' emotional trauma and grief, stress, scholastic problems, stigmatization and discrimination, missing out on educational opportunities and experiencing poverty. The empirical research also revealed that these children and adolescents do not get the necessary familial support from their relatives, especially immediately after the death of their parents. On the basis of both the literature review and the empirical research findings, the researcher made suggestions for an ecosystemic psycho-social support of learners affected by the HIV/AIDS pandemic in order to enhance and strengthen their psycho-social well-being.</field><field name="date">2010-05-27T10:37:07Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecosystemic</field><field name="subject">Approach</field><field name="subject">Support</field><field name="subject">Orphaned</field><field name="subject">Learners</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Psychological</field><field name="subject">Well-being</field><field name="subject">Performance</field><field name="subject">Social</field><field name="subject">Physical</field><field name="subject">Psycho-social</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restraint of trade covenants in the context of the freedom to trade / Johanna Antoinette Esterhuizen</field><field name="creator">Esterhuizen, Johanna Antoinette</field><field name="description">Thesis (LLM)--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010.</field><field name="date">2010-06-01T09:19:19Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flourishing in a group of South African adolescents / I. van Schalkwyk.</field><field name="creator">Van Schalkwyk, Izanette</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (Psychology))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010.</field><field name="date">2010-06-11T10:28:41Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychosocial well-being</field><field name="subject">Flourishing</field><field name="subject">Languishing</field><field name="subject">Adolescents</field><field name="subject">Resilience</field><field name="subject">Mixed-method</field><field name="subject">South Africa</field><field name="subject">Psychological strengths</field><field name="subject">Positive psychology</field><field name="subject">Programme evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The chemical reactor for the decomposition of sulphuric acid for the hybrid sulphur process / by M.D. Coetzee</field><field name="creator">Coetzee, Martin-David</field><field name="description">The utilisation of alternate sources of energy has reached critical levels due to the constantly growing demand for energy and the diminishing of fossil fuels.

The two-step thermochemical cycle for decomposing water into hydrogen and oxygen offers the potential to obtain acceptable thermal efficiencies, while still using common and inexpensive chemicals. The process mainly makes use of two unit process operations: an electrolyser and a chemical decomposition reactor. This research project focuses on the concept design of the decomposition reactor operated adiabatically as a multi-stage reactor system with inter-stage heating, in order to simplify the reactor design.

A study of relevant literature has shown that the metaphor "God the Father" is seldom incorporated in pastoral counselling. This study explores the possibility of successfully incorporating the concept "Fatherhood of God" in the counselling of the adoptee. In order to do so, the perspectives of the basis theory and metatheory have been investigated. The basis theory has been developed through an exegetical study of Old Testament verses that speak explicitly of the Fatherhood of God, as well as the three Abba-texts of the New Testament. This indicates that the covenant is closely related to the Fatherhood of God. The metatheory has been developed after studying literature regarding adoption from the perspective of other disciplines. The matters identity, rejection and loss have been shown as significant issues in the life of the adoptee. An empirical study has been done in addition to the basis- and metatheory. This investigation has brought to light that the adoptee does in general sense not connect the concept "Fatherhood of God" to his adoption. In order to develop an own model, different existing models have been investigated. Thus it was decided to use the model of Eyrich and Hines as guideline. A model has been developed and proposed that successfully incorporates the research findings of this study. It seems that the concept "Fatherhood" of God can be successfully utilised in the pastoral counselling of the adoptee, especially regarding the issues of identity, rejection and loss.</field><field name="date">2010-08-19T08:24:54Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adoptee</field><field name="subject">Adoptive parents</field><field name="subject">Adoption</field><field name="subject">Biological parents</field><field name="subject">Covenant</field><field name="subject">Fatherhood of God</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Loss</field><field name="subject">Pastoral counselling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discussion of a unique collaboration model between schools / Werner de Klerk</field><field name="creator">De Klerk, Werner</field><field name="description">The schools located in many township and rural areas of South Africa struggle to provide a high standard of education because many of the inhabitants of these areas are very poor and there is thus a lack of the funding required for the necessary educational equipment.

Learners with adequate emotional intelligence will demonstrate effective functioning in many areas of life. The aim of this investigation was to determine what emotional intelligence is and how it relates to wellbeing in the early development of adolescents, the state of a certain Grade 7-learner group's emotional intelligence and the relation in terms of race and gender. In the study, 50 learners from the Grade 7-classes of four schools were selected randomly based on availability. The schools involved were Swartruggens Combined School, Swartruggens Primary, Koster Combined School and Koster Primary. The BarOn EQ-i:YV was conducted on the learners. The quantitative data was processed by the Northwest University's Statistical Consultation Services. Results indicate that, amongst other things, the girls in the study posses more adequate emotional intelligence and skills than the boys in the study. Black boys show the least adequate emotional intelligence and skills. Thus, race and gender play an important role in the development of emotional intelligence of the group of learners.</field><field name="date">2010-08-19T08:31:42Z</field><field name="language">Afrikaans</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotional intelligence</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal skills</field><field name="subject">Adolescence</field><field name="subject">Wellness</field><field name="subject">Grade 7 Learners</field><field name="subject">Race differences</field><field name="subject">Gender differences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'n Histories-kritiese studie van spraakonderrig aan Transvaalse skole, 1838-1951 / deur T.

This is accomplished through identifying the underlying expectations and obligations that govern this relationship. The identified expectations and obligations are categorised into themes according to similarity, and motivated through literature on psychological contract theory and other relevant theories.  This article proposes and tests a psychological contract measure specifically designed for the member-union exchange relationship. The study expands on previous research, and motivates the findings of this article through relevant literature. A high level of validity and reliability is maintained throughout the article by complying with the criteria set out by Freese and Schalk (2008) for the effective measurement of the psychological contract. The article concludes that the questionnaire compiled for this study, is in fact an accurate, reliable and valid instrument for the measurement of the Member-Union Psychological Contract, and also indicates the current emotional state of the member-union relationship in the education sector in South Africa.</field><field name="date">2010-08-30T07:32:44Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of platinum mine tailings storage facilities : an ecotoxicological perspective / Mandy T. Jubileus</field><field name="creator">Jubileus, Mandy Theresa</field><field name="description">South Africa is one of the most important mining countries in the world, hosting the world's largest reserves of platinum group metals (PGMs). Even though mining is clearly an important activity in South Africa, contributing approximately US$ 7.4 billion annually to the countries' gross domestic product (GDP), the costs to the environment are not insignificant. One of the most severe environmental aspects associated with mining is the storage of mineral waste on tailings storage facilities due to their impacts on air quality, ground water quality, aesthetics and land use. It is also unknown whether the environmental effects of tailings storage facilities increase or decrease over time. The aim of this study was to determine the ecotoxicity of platinum tailings storage facilities of different ages by means of soil physical and chemical analysis, earthworm ecotoxicological studies, dehydrogenase activity and soil mesofauna studies. Samples were obtained from three platinum tailings storage facilities of different ages of which two were already rehabilitated while the third was still operational at the time this study was performed. The latter was used as a negative control for the purpose of the study. Soil samples were physically and chemically analysed. Earthworm ecotoxicological studies were conducted to determine changes in biomass, reproduction, mortality, neutral red retention times and tissue metal concentrations. Dehydrogenase activity was determined before the introduction of earthworms and manure, after introductions of manure and after introductions of earthworms and manure. Soil mesofauna were extracted and identified in order to determine species richness, diversity, abundance and functional grouping. Soil chemical analysis indicated that concentrations of certain heavy metals, especially chrome (Cr), present in platinum tailings materials could have a potential effect on microorganisms, microbial processes and earthworms. Earthworm ecotoxicological results indicated that earthworms that bioaccumulated higher levels of heavy metals showed poor hatchability of cocoons. Dehydrogenase activity indicated that earthworms play a significant role in increasing the number and biomass of soil microbes because significant increases in dehydrogenase activity were noticed after the addition of earthworms to platinum tailings materials. Results from the earthworm ecotoxicological studies, dehydrogenase activity, and soil mesofauna composition indicated that environmental impacts of tailings storage facilities did not increase with age, but is more likely to be an indication of the rehabilitation measures administered to the different tailings storage facilities.</field><field name="date">2010-08-30T07:46:12Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earthworms</field><field name="subject">Bioassays</field><field name="subject">Dehydrogenase activity</field><field name="subject">Soil mesofauna</field><field name="subject">Metals</field><field name="subject">Biomarkers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Die aard en omvang van die "alle risiko"-polis in die seeversekeringsreg / deur D.J.

Kunene</field><field name="creator">Kunene, Nisile</field><field name="description">The African Clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) is most likely the most studied amphibian to date. This animal is widely used as a laboratory screening model for the testing of various chemicals. In recent years, there has been considerable controversy over the possible effects of the widely-used herbicide atrazine on amphibians. There were claims that this broadleaf herbicide causes gonadal abnormalities in amphibians, including feminisation and the promotion of a form of abnormality in the testes characterised by the presence of ovarian follicles (oocytes). Clawed frogs are native to Africa and were used in this study to test the reproductive success and development of F2 offspring after the F1 parent animals were exposed to known atrazine concentrations from 96 hrs to 24 month-old mature frogs. Animals were exposed to four nominal concentrations of atrazine (0, 1, 10, 25 ug/&#163;). Male and female frogs were paired off according to the atrazine concentration in which they were reared and spawning was induced. Clutch size and survival of offspring were used to evaluate developmental success. Gonads of metamorphs as well as breeding F1 frogs were examined for gross anomalies. Testes were serially sectioned and screened for anomalies at the microscopic level. We were unable to find any concentration response to hatching success, time to metamorphosis or sex ratios. No indication of a transgenerational effect of atrazine on spawning success or reproductive development of X. laevis was observed. Adult X. laevis collected along a north-south transect from the south-west Western Cape region to the north-east were analysed and screened for gonadal anomalies. We found that, irrespective of exposure to atrazine, male X. laevis from north-east sites contained testicular ovarian follicles whereas none of the animals from the Western Cape sites had any. Differences between these populations of X. laevis have been reported and it cannot be excluded that they belong to separate species, in which case the phenomenon of testicular ovarian follicles could be associated with the northern form and with no relevance to atrazine usage. Atrazine has been widely used in South Africa for more than 40 years, and still robust populations ofX laevis with balanced sex ratios occur throughout its distribution range -which include the major maize production area in South Africa. Our data does not support the hypothesis that atrazine impacts negatively on amphibians in natural situations and at environmentally relevant concentrations.</field><field name="date">2010-08-30T07:58:43Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/3740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The status of music education in the selected high schools in Lusaka Province, Zambia / Aloysio K.

Breedt</field><field name="creator">Breedt, Tielman Francois</field><field name="description">The paper reports on a Consumer Service Index (CSI) model that was developed for the accommodation industry in South Africa to assist the disabled and elderly traveller when using accommodation facilities in South Africa. The CSI model was adapted from current models used to form the Disability Index (Dl) by using the results obtained through a structured questionnaire sent to hotels in South Africa. The Dl forms part of the marketing tools of hotels in South Africa for improved communication and information to physical disabled and elderly travellers when selecting accommodation. Qualitative research was done in this research study and focused on key areas within the hotels that provide problems to disabled and elderly travellers. Key areas in the hotel with problems were the reception, bathroom, bar area and swimming pool. The problems with the areas were identified using the Dl and recommendations were made to improve the accessibility to these areas for travellers. The response of the questionnaire was sufficient to develop the Dl and to make recommendations for change to the guidelines used by the Tourism Grading Council to establish the disabled friendly status. While the statistics for disabled travellers are not clear in South Africa and most of Africa, the US and EU tourism authority claimed that the disabled traveller market is an untapped market for all countries. First world countries (USA and EU) have introduced regulations and laws to improve the accessibility to tourism sites and transportation for disabled and elderly travellers. This regulations and laws form part of the first step to obtaining this untapped tourism market of disabled and elderly travellers for every country in the tourism service and product industry. The introduction of the Dl into the evaluation of hotels would support the regulations and laws of accessibility.</field><field name="date">2009-02-17T12:42:46Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a framework to assist with risk mitigation in a procurement environment / Yvette Brits</field><field name="creator">Brits, Yvette</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.B.A.)--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008.</field><field name="date">2009-02-17T12:45:15Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arbeidsverhoudinge in die verpraktisering van beroepsveiligheid / deur Lerine Joubert</field><field name="creator">Joubert, Lerine</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.Com.

Dickson</field><field name="creator">Dickson, Mark Lloyd</field><field name="description">The claim that a principle known as Irreducible Complexity (IC) is empirically discoverable is investigated successively from the perspective of engineering, then molecular biology and finally theology, with the aim of evaluating the utility of IC for an interdisciplinary dialogue between all three. In the process, IC is subjected to the principle objections presented against it in the literature, leading to the conclusion that IC is sufficiently resistant to scientific criticism to be accepted as a true property of certain living systems. The ubiquity of machine descriptors in the professional literature of molecular biology is scrutinised in the context of the role of metaphor in science, as well as in the context of entailment models. A Biblical Theological approach to the Bible is harnessed to establish a framework for estimating the extent to which the story of Christ warrants expectation of first order design formalisms in nature, and whether that story within itself provides any homomorphic exemplification of IC. Additionally, key theological criticisms of IC are evaluated as well as criticisms of the Neo Darwinian revisioning of the Biblical account. The overall conclusion is that a true interdisciplinary dialogue where IC is the nexus holds theoretical as well as experimental promise.</field><field name="date">2009-02-17T12:56:56Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irreducible complexity</field><field name="subject">Neo Darwinism</field><field name="subject">Biblical theology</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Evolution</field><field name="subject">Molecular biology</field><field name="subject">Engineering</field><field name="subject">Interdisciplinary dialogue</field><field name="subject">Mechanism</field><field name="subject">Machine</field><field name="subject">Metaphor</field><field name="subject">Naturalism</field><field name="subject">Narrative</field><field name="subject">Entailment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artikel 7(3) van die Wet op Egskeiding 70 van 1979 en die verdeling van trustbates / deur C.N.

Mulaudzi</field><field name="creator">Mulaudzi, Mmboniseni Phanuel</field><field name="description">The main categories of assets held by banks are risky assets (loans and intangible assets), Treasuries (bonds issued by the national Treasury) and reserves. Our contribution models how decisions about the allocation of available funds to the former two types are dependent on perceptions about risk and regret. Our discussion is based on utility theory where a regret attribute is considered alongside a risk component as an integral part of the objective function. Preferences among risky assets and Treasuries are described by the maximization of the expected value of a utility function that depends on the funds available to the bank. Moreover, we conjecture that anticipated disutility from regret can dramatically impact the choices of assets types that risk-and regret-averse banks decide to hold. Here we conclude that, compared with the risk-averse case, the bank who takes regret into account will be exposed to higher credit and market risk when the difference between the expected return on risky assets and the Treasuries rate is small but lower risk exposure when this difference is high. We also assess how regret can influence a bank's view of rate of return loan guarantees, as measured by its willingness-to-incur-costs (WTIC) that are related to the screening and monitoring of debtor and guarantor status. We find that regret increases the regret-averse bank's WTIC for a guarantee when the asset portfolio is relatively risky, but decreases when the portfolio is considered to be safe. A feature of our contribution is that the main issues are briefly analysed and, where possible, the outcomes are represented graphically. In this regard, we comment on the claim that an investment away from risky assets towards Treasuries is responsible for credit crunches in the banking industry.</field><field name="date">2009-02-17T13:45:32Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated framework to improve the entrepreneurial climate in the South African mining industry / by Jacobus Hendrik Oosthuizen</field><field name="creator">Oosthuizen, Jacobus Hendrik</field><field name="description">Thesis (Ph.D. (Entrepreneurship))--North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007.</field><field name="date">2009-02-17T13:45:49Z</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10394/774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and quantification of Fusarium verticillioides in South African maize and its effect on grain quality and toxicity / Belinda Janse van Rensburg</field><field name="creator">Van Rensburg, Belinda Janse</field><field name="description">Thesis (M.
