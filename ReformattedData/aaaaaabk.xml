This study documents infective episodes at two resource disparate NICUs; the Grantley Stable Neonatal Unit (GSNU), Royal Brisbane and Women&#8217;s Hospital (RBWH), Australia 1997-2006 and Danang NICU, Vietnam. The specific aims are: 1. To compare the incidence of neonatal septicaemia at RBWH and Danang NICU. 2. To compare of the epidemiological characteristics of nosocomial infections in the two NICUs. 3. To study risk factors associated with nosocomial infection in the two NICUs (including staff numbers, infant numbers and nursing workload). 4. To review published guidelines on healthcare physical environments and staffing levels and to survey the GSNU &amp; Danang NICU in relation to these. 5. To develop a prospective surveillance system to monitor infection episodes in Danang NICU 6. To recommend strategies for the control of neonatal sepsis in Danang NICU. The GSNU at the RBWH, Australia is a 71 bed neonatal care facility with an established infection surveillance system in a well resource environment. Danang NICU, Vietnam provides care to a high risk neonatal population with no established infection surveillance system in a developing country with more limited resources. This study found the GSNU had a low rate of neonatal septicaemia, during the ten year period from 1997 to 2006 with 253 babies (2.1%) diagnosed with septicaemia. In Danang NICU, in the year 2007 alone, there were 52 cases (2.9%) of septicaemia documented but the incidence of neonatal infection is likely to have underestimated due to (i) the failure to collect blood culture before commencing antibiotic treatment. (ii) Difficulties associated with data retrieval from maternal and neonatal records and (iii) lack of a systematic surveillance system with prospectively collected data. The organisms causing early onset and late onset septicaemia were substantially different in the two NICUs. Group B streptococcus (GBS) and Escherichia coli were the major organisms causing early onset sepsis (EOS) at the GSNU, accounting for 37.8% and 29.7% respectively, whilst coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CONS) was the commonest organism (25.7%) for late onset sepsis (LOS). In Danang NICU, Klebsiella spp was the major pathogen and was responsible for 75% of neonatal septicaemia in both early and late onset sepsis. The isolation of Klebsiella spp in a high proportion of infants at less than 48 hours may suggest nosocomial or maternal route of acquisition. The rate of GBS infections in Danang Hospital, Vietnam, is hard to estimate and interpret due to limited microbiologic data. The anti-serum used to classify the Streptococcal types is not readily available in Danang Hospital. In some cases, organisms that are isolated are suspected to be GBS however, this is not confirmed microbiologically. The study identifies a high prevalence of neonatal septicaemia in Danang NICU. It identifies a close relationship between rates of infection and poor nursing care practices and limited resources. The standard care system used at the GSNU as well as the international literature was studied in relation to infection control practices. This was then used to develop the following recommendations that specifically target a reduction in infection rates in Danang NICU: 1. Implement an infection surveillance system 2. Report regularly from the database and embed discussion of the data into unit management policy 3. Revise neonatal and pathology practice in relation to blood cultures 4. Use shorter duration of antibiotics course based on culture results 5. Modify care practices that expose infants to cross infection 6. Identify specific staff with particular responsibilities in maintenance of standards</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatal septicaemia, surveillance system, infection control practices, Klebsiella infection in NICU, nosocomial infection</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determinants of Schistosoma japonicum and soil-transmitted helminth infections, and associated morbidity in Hunan province, China: an epidemiological assessment</field><field name="creator">Julie Balen</field><field name="description">Introduction Schistosomiasis is one of the most important and widespread diseases of rural poverty. Worldwide, approximately 779 million people are at risk of infection, with 207 million already infected. Infections with Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworms and Trichuris trichiura, collectively known as the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), are also highly endemic throughout the tropics, particularly in resource-poor settings. An estimated 1 billion people worldwide are estimated to be infected with STHs. Schistosomes and STHs often co-exist in the same epidemiological settings and, given the high prevalence of concurrent multiple species infections (multiparasitism), a combined approach to prevention and control could lead to significant improvements, including reducing costs associated with single-species control programmes. In China, rigorous national schistosomiasis control efforts over the past 60 years have decreased the prevalence by over 90%; however, since 2000 the number of infected individuals has been rising, possibly indicative of a re-emergence. Fishermen, migrant communities and poor households in rural areas may be most at risk of single and multiple-species parasitic infections and the associated morbidity. Objectives This Ph.D. thesis is structured according to four main goals and a number of specific objectives: Firstly, to update estimates of S. japonicum prevalence, intensity and associated morbidity levels in Hunan province, China, according to the third national PES carried out in 2004; Secondly, to investigate existing barriers in access to preventive, diagnostic and treatment services for advanced schistosomiasis; Thirdly, to compare and evaluate direct and proxy methods of measuring household socio-economic position, according to data on income, savings and asset-based estimations of wealth; and Finally, to explore and identify behavioural, demographic, economic, environmental and social risk factors associated with the distribution of S. japonicum, STHs and multiple species infections, in two villages of the Dongting Lake region, Hunan province, China. Methods Firstly, we used data from the third national schistosomiasis periodic epidemiological survey (PES) of 2004. In Hunan province, the PES was carried out in 47 villages of the endemic Dongting lake area. A total of 47144 human serological, 7205 stool, and 3893 clinical examinations were performed. For the reservoir hosts, stools from 874 buffaloes and other domestic animals were examined for schistosomiasis by the miracidial hatching test. Secondly, we conducted an in-depth study involving interviews with 66 schistosomiasis control staff and 79 advanced schistosomiasis patient, and six focus group discussions (FGDs), in the Dongting lake region, between August 2002 and February 2003. Using the Health-Access Livelihood framework we examined availability, accessibility, affordability, adequacy and acceptability of schistosomiasis control in the Dongting lake area. Lastly, we carried out two village-wide parasitological, clinical and questionnaire-based investigations between October and December 2006. Parasitological examinations for the prevalence of S. japonicum and the STHs were performed by the Kato-Katz thick smear method, with repeated sampling of each individual. We took fingerprick blood samples to assess haemoglobin levels, using a B-haemoglobin HemoCue photometer. The household-based questionnaire focused on direct and proxy measurements of household wealth, while the individual-based questionnaire focused on demographic and behavioural factors, treatment history and self-perceived symptoms. Results Human sero-prevalence was 11.9% (range: 1.3-34.9% at village level), and the rate of egg-positive stools was 1.9% (0-10.9%) for the same population. The prevalence of infection among buffaloes was 9.5% (0-66.7%). Extrapolating to the entire population of the Dongting Lake region, an estimated 73225 people and 13973 buffaloes were infected. Most frequently reported symptoms were abdominal pain (6.2%) and bloody stools (2.7%). Accessibility and affordability were major barriers in access to schistosomiasis control. Many of staff interviewed indicated that a majority of patients who develop advanced schistosomiasis resided in mildly-endemic or non-endemic settings. None of the patients interviewed had any form of health insurance, and most of their health expenses were out-of-pocket payments. Exploratory factor analysis generated internally robust proxy wealth indices, however these were not complementary to direct measures of household wealth, as indicated by low correlation co-efficients. We found wide disparities in household ownership of durable assets, utility and sanitation, within both settings. Pooled data from the rural and peri-urban settings highlighted structural differences in socioeconomic position (SEP), more likely a result of localised urbanization and modernization. We found higher infection prevalences in rural settings, than in peri-urban settings, for schistosomiasis (6.3% and 6.7% respectively), ascariasis (8.3% and 2.2%, respectively) and trichuriasis (5.1% and 0.5%, respectively), but lower for hookworms (0.1% and 1.5% respectively). Multiple species infections (2.6% and 0.2%, respectively) were less prevalent than single species infections (14.5% and 10.4%). There were significant disparities in the prevalence of parasitic infections between poorest and least poor quintiles of the cohort population. Anaemia and other symptoms, especially headache, stomach ache and swollen stomach, were common in both rural and peri-urban village settings. Conclusion The studies conducted within the framework of this Ph.D. thesis document the current situation pertaining to schistosomiasis and the STHs in Hunan province, China. Our findings highlight the need for increased surveillance, monitoring and health education, with relation to schistosomiasis and STHs, in non-endemic or post-transmission control settings. Based upon these results, we call for improved diagnostic tools, particularly in the case of low intensity infections and for hookworm, and propose an extension of the use of available infrastructure, human resources, knowledge and technology by integrating prevention and control of schistosomiasis with that of other intestinal helminths, particularly STHs. In the future, our studies may form a base from which to further examine local needs and priorities for parasitic disease control in the area.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">access</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">control programmes</field><field name="subject">Dongting Lake Region</field><field name="subject">equity</field><field name="subject">Hunan Province</field><field name="subject">multi-parasitism</field><field name="subject">Schistosoma japonicum</field><field name="subject">schistosomiasis</field><field name="subject">social determinants</field><field name="subject">soil-transmitted helminthiasis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time Use and Depressive Symptoms in Adolescence</field><field name="creator">Laura Desha</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT When depressive illness has its onset during adolescence it can exert a profound negative influence upon the individual and their daily functioning. Early identification of young people at risk of, or already experiencing, depressive symptoms is critical to enabling targeted intervention from clinicians, including occupational therapists. Early identification, however, is hampered by an incomplete understanding of how the disorder manifests in the daily lives of adolescents. The mental health determinants and sequelae of engagement in everyday activities represent core concerns of occupational therapists. As part of therapy with adolescents in Child and Youth Mental Health Services (CYMHS), occupational therapists endeavour to improve health by assessing time use, and engaging in interventions which explicitly target involvement in daily activity. Notwithstanding current practice, evidence for a link between actual time use and depressive symptom severity is scant. Background and Research Aims In this thesis the time use of adolescents is explored and related to depressive symptom severity in a series of three cross sectional studies. In keeping with ecologically- and occupation-focussed theoretical models of health and adolescent development (Bronfenbrenner &amp; Morris, 2006; Poulsen &amp; Ziviani, 2004; World Health Organization, 2002), a novel approach to the study of time use has been taken. The studies quantify the amount of time that adolescents are exposed to the various conditions inherent in activities and their ecological settings. In conceptualising time use as &#8216;exposure&#8217;, attention is drawn specifically to common affordances of activities. In this thesis these are described as &#8216;underlying dimensions&#8217; of time use. Key underlying dimensions of interest include (a) &#8216;physical exertion&#8217; in daily time use, (b) time spent with different social partners, and (c) time engaged in structured activities. The studies make use of cumulative estimates of time use by summing each episode of exposure to the underlying dimensions of time use, across the out-of-school hours. This research was conducted with the aims of (a) aiding early identification of adolescents who are vulnerable to depressive illness, (b) examining the evidence for the assessment of time use in CYMHS, (c) identifying aspects of adolescent time use which are appropriate targets for occupational therapists&#8217; intervention, and (d) directing future research into the effectiveness of time use-focussed interventions offered by occupational therapists to adolescents who are vulnerable to depressive illness. Methodology and Study Findings All the studies involve secondary analysis of interview and time diary data collected from a nationally representative sample of approximately 730 adolescents (13-18 years) participating in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement II. Data were gathered in 2002/2003 by the Institute of Social Research at the University of Michigan in America. Studies 1 and 2 employ ordinal logistic regression analyses to separately explore two of the underlying dimensions of time use, namely the physical exertion in daily activity, and the time spent engaged in activity alone or with key social partners (including parents, siblings and friends). These studies indicate that time devoted to physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity does not predict depressive symptom severity, breadth of participation in sporting extracurricular activity may be protective against depressive illness for males. For both genders, factors related to the positive or negative aspects of social relationships (such as adolescents&#8217; ratings of how close they felt to parents, and the extent of risky behaviour among friends) appear to be stronger predictors of depressive symptomatology than the actual amount of time engaged in activity with others. Study 3 is informed conceptually and methodologically by the findings of Studies 1 and 2, and uses structural equation modeling, to examine a complex multivariate model of time use and depressive symptoms. This model incorporates a large range of factors which are theorized to influence the qualitative experience of spending time in a given context (e.g., adolescents&#8217; perceptions of friend acceptance, which may influence the psychological impact of a prolonged encounter with friends). Study 3 reveals that the quantity of time over the course of a weekday or weekend day that adolescents are exposed to different types of activity (e.g., structured extracurricular activity, shared activity with parents) has no direct association with depressive symptom severity. However, an indirect path is identified, whereby the amount of time devoted to joint activity with parents is linked with depressive symptom severity via adolescent perceptions of parent acceptance. Conclusions and Recommendations The studies of this thesis have shown that the conceptualisation and quantification of time use as cumulative exposure to some specific underlying dimensions of engagement, are of little direct assistance in identifying young people who are vulnerable to depressive illness, however, this information may inform a range of clinical practices for occupational therapists working in CYMHS. Information on time use is therefore worth gathering in such services, particularly when it provides insights into social contact. It has been clearly and consistently identified that time use and its links with depression cannot be fully appreciated without considering the nature of adolescents&#8217; relationships with their social partners in time use. Findings indicate that when time spent engaged in joint activity with parents is scant, or when poor relationships with parents are reported, adolescents at risk of depression are likely to benefit from therapy which is directed towards enhancing the quantity and quality of parent-adolescent interactions. The significance of this research lies in the generation of evidence to support further research into time use and its implications for mental health. Greater support for the specialist role of occupational therapists in addressing time use concerns will be gained through future studies which explore the immediate affective experience of spending time in activity, the personal and environmental contextual factors which mediate these experiences, and the implications of such experiences for mental health. Further to the insights gained regarding time use and depressive illness, the thesis presents an approach to research (i.e., a secondary analysis) and research methodologies which may be used by occupational therapists to answer complex questions regarding occupational engagement across the lifespan.

The crime was the rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. The Taint looks at the time leading up to his conviction for rape, including the years he spent in Westbrook Boys&#8217; Reformatory and Boggo Road Gaol as a minor, and then his sentence served in NSW gaols with such inmates as Stephen Bradley, the man who kidnapped and murdered Graham Thorne, and the bizarre but rather likeable Dave Scanlan, known for his exploits as &#8220;the Kingsgrove Slasher&#8221;. In prison, Scanlan encouraged him to become an elite sportsman and released, Poss was recruited by Canterbury Eels football team; but just on the point of making a name for himself in Sydney, someone discovered that he had been gaoled for rape, and humiliated, he left the team. He moved back home to Queensland via Grafton, NSW (where he met and later married the Jacaranda Queen) and continued his sporting career, but never again in the Big League. He became the Manager of the Waterside Workers&#8217; Club and helped prevent a turf war between the Wharfies and members of the Painters and Dockers. Poss is now working with lawyer Robert Bax to have his case re-opened. He believes his story to be a cautionary tale for young men. It is a chronicle of social change, including the sexual revolution of the sixties, the confrontations with &#8220;the demons&#8221; in the streets of Brisbane during the Joh era of Bible-bashing fundamentalism and police corruption. It&#8217;s a story about what really went on behind closed doors in institutions where vulnerable children were preyed upon, in gaols where men were expected to become beasts. It is a story of how the taint of a terrible crime affected a man&#8217;s whole life. &#8220;QUESTIONS OF OWNERSHIP&#8221; Writing someone else&#8217;s story can be an ethical minefield&#9472;especially regarding questions of ownership. Who owns the story, the subject or the author? The easy answer to this is the subject owns the story and the author the text, but on closer examination this may not necessarily be so. Then there are those other stakeholders who claim ownership of story: people who embrace a narrative because of its similarity to their own lives. Published stories about institutional abuse have resonated for adults who as children were placed into the care of churches or the state. Another kind of ownership is claimed by readers who accept a version of a story and dismiss any counter-story as being invalid. What I call the &#8220;Plath Phenomenon&#8221; is an example of this. I will examine these kinds of ownership of story with particular reference to the work of Janet Malcolm on biography and then will look at gaps and silences in &#8220;official&#8221; stories, those created in police stations and courtrooms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">police corruption, injustice, Bjelke-Petersen, unions, verballing, court transcripts, sportsmanship, prison life, Westbrook, tainted evidence.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"IT'S A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN JUST ABOUT MY PAIN": Understanding and Responding to the Social Dimension of Living with Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Amanda Nielsen</field><field name="description">Chronic pain has been identified as a major and underestimated health care problem, with extensive individual, social and economic ramifications. It has been estimated that the annual economic cost of chronic pain in Australia exceeds AU$34 billion. The available epidemiological evidence suggests chronic pain is a relatively common health problem in Australia which is a significant public health issue. Chronic pain is a complex phenomenon which is not easily defined. However, it is important to consider the ways in which chronic pain is conceptualised, as this can have significant implications for the individual in terms of how they think about their pain, and the way they are treated within the health care system and the broader society. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, pain was predominantly considered a symptom of a biological problem in the body. Absence of physical disease was thought to indicate pain was the result of aberrant psychological processes. However, chronic pain proved resistant to this &#8216;mind-body&#8217; approach, and the lack of efficacy of many biomedical interventions, combined with an apparently increasing prevalence of chronic pain, pointed to the inadequacy of purely biomedical approaches to pain treatment. The latter part of the twentieth century saw the recognition of pain as a multidimensional experience influenced by the interaction of numerous biological, psychological and social factors. Consequently, the biopsychosocial model of health, which emphasised such a &#8216;holistic&#8217; perspective, gained substantial recognition in the pain management domain, and was endorsed as the preferred model of pain management. This has contributed to the development of new approaches to chronic pain treatment, particularly in the area of cognitive behavioural therapy and the establishment of multidisciplinary pain centres. There is evidence, however, that the &#8216;promise&#8217; of the multidimensional conceptualisation and treatment of chronic pain has not been realised in the daily lives of people with chronic pain. Review of the literature indicates a tendency for research and practice to focus on the biological and psychological aspects of chronic pain, while minimising social environmental factors, such as the health care system and cultural belief systems regarding pain, which may also be significant. This thesis proposes that in order to more comprehensively respond to the complex phenomenon of chronic pain, it is necessary to further develop the social domain of the biopsychosocial model. A study was conducted to explore and describe individual experiences of living with chronic pain, as a basis for improving knowledge about the influence of the social environment on the individual. The thesis focuses not only on the individual descriptions of living with chronic pain, but also on the inter-relatedness between the individual and their social environment. Further, this thesis uses a process of critical interpretive analysis to identify aspects of the social environment which can exert a constraining or enabling effect on the individual with chronic pain. The thesis draws on critical realism theory, particularly the morphogenetic approach developed by Archer (1995), to guide the analysis process and to develop potential strategies for addressing identified social disadvantages. The integration of the individual stories of living with chronic pain with an interpretive analysis process, and the underlabouring philosophical perspective of critical realism, provided the framework to investigate the influence of the social environment on individual experience of living with chronic pain. In this thesis, a journey metaphor is used as an overarching framework to tie together the three principal themes identified through the analysis of the interview transcripts. The themes focused on the biomedical, psychological and cultural paths that participants followed in search of understanding and cure for their pain; the social suffering they experienced through lack of understanding and legitimation of their condition; and the identification and development of strategies for living with chronic pain. The thesis highlights the critical importance of focusing not only on the individual with chronic pain but also on the social environment within which the individual lives, and the ways in which these domains intersect and influence each other. The social environment was found to condition the individual and others in society, including health care practitioners, in relation to how they think and behave regarding pain, which in turn can have enabling or constraining consequences for the individual with pain. In particular, cultural beliefs about &#8216;normal&#8217; pain, and the material structures of the health care system and employment and work places, were found to have a potentially negative impact on the individual with pain. It is concluded that these aspects of society will continue to exert constraining influences on people&#8217;s lives until the focus of policy and practice is expanded to include not just the individual with pain, but also the social environment in which they live. To address this, a number of policy and practice improvements are suggested.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biopsychosocial</field><field name="subject">critical realism</field><field name="subject">chronic pain</field><field name="subject">qualitative</field><field name="subject">social suffering</field><field name="subject">stigma</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and Function of Binuclear Metallohydrolases: Enterobacter aerogenes glycerophosphodiesterase and related enzymes</field><field name="creator">Kieran Hadler</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on structural and functional studies of a novel glycerophosphodiesterase (GpdQ) from Enterobacter aerogenes. GpdQ is highly promiscuous and is the first known phosphatase which is capable of degrading all three classes of phosphate esters (mono-, di- and triesters). Remarkably, GpdQ is also able to hydrolyse stable aliphatic phosphate esters and has been shown to degrade the hydrolysis product of the nerve agent VX. For these reasons, GpdQ has been realised to have potential as a powerful bioremediator for the removal of organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. GpdQ is a binuclear metallohydrolase in which one of the metal ions is very weakly bound. Chapter 1 introduces the catalytic mechanisms of binuclear metallohydrolases by examining two related phosphate ester-degrading enzymes. Since one of the main features of catalysis addressed in this thesis are the differential metal binding affinities of GpdQ, Chapter 1 also canvasses a range of other binuclear metallohydrolases with similar behaviour. Chapter 2 examines the structural and evolutionary relationship between GpdQ and a number of other related enzymes. Using genome database searches, the two most closely related enzymes are identified. In performing these searches, a novel, putative binuclear metallohydrolase from Homo sapiens is also discovered. This enzyme, Hsa_aTRACP, is most closely related to PAPs, however construction of a homology model indicates that the active site tyrosine residue of PAP is replaced by histidine. In this respect, it may represent an evolutionary link to Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and GpdQ. The biology and chemistry of this putative enzyme is discussed. PAPs are the only binuclear enzymes with an established heterovalent active site of the type Fe(III)-M(II) (where M=Fe, Zn or Mn) whereas the majority of enzymes in this family have homovalent metal centres, including GpdQ and Ser/Thr protein. This is brought about due to the nature of the coordination sphere imposed by the enzyme. The activity of GpdQ can be reconstituted in the presence of Co(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Cd(II). Chapter 3 examines the kinetic properties of a binuclear homovalent system by studying the kinetic properties of Cd(II)-substituted GpdQ and a corresponding model complex. This comparative study leads to the identification of a terminal hydroxide molecule as the likely reaction-initiating nucleophile in Cd(II)-GpdQ with a pKa of 9.4. In Chapter 4, a detailed study of the structural, kinetic and spectroscopic behaviour of Co(II)-substituted GpdQ is presented. This chapter specifically probes the formation of the binuclear active site, the role of the metal ions in catalysis, the identity of the nucleophile and the potential role of any first or second coordination sphere residues in the regulation of enzyme activity, proton donation and metal ion coordination. Based on these findings, a detailed reaction mechanism is proposed in which the substrate itself promotes the formation of the catalytically competent binuclear centre and phosphorolysis occurs following nucleophilic attack by a terminal hydroxide molecule. A potential role of Asn80 (a ligand of one of the metal ions) in regulating both substrate and metal binding, and the role of the bridging hydroxide molecule in the activation of the terminal nucleophile is proposed. Chapter 5 employs a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic techniques to probe the proposed catalytic mechanism of GpdQ in depth. The formation of the catalytically competent binuclear centre is observed in pre-steady state studies, an integral first step in the catalytic mechanism. The dissociation and rate constants associated with formation of the binuclear centre are quantified. The rate of substrate turnover in GpdQ is relatively modest but is enhanced by a structural rearrangement involving the flexible Asn80 ligand. This structural change fine-tunes the reaction mechanism, leading to optimal reactivity. The steady-state kinetic properties of a series of metal ion derivatives (Co(II), Cd(II) and Mn(II)) of GpdQ and their reactivity towards a number of substrates are also compared. These findings lead to the conclusion that the reaction mechanism of GpdQ is modulated by both substrate and metal ion. In this respect, GpdQ is adaptive to the environmental conditions to which it is exposed by employing a flexible mechanistic strategy to achieve catalysis. Chapter 6 correlates the electronic and geometric structure of the binuclear centre in GpdQ as a means to probe specific aspects of the mechanism. This study uses the wild type enzyme and a site-directed mutant (Asn80Asp) to examine the structure of the metal ions at two stages of catalysis. The role of the bridging hydroxide molecule in nucleophilic activation is specifically addressed by monitoring changes in the electronic exchange interaction and other structural parameters as a result of phosphate binding. Also, the coordination environment of the metal ions in both the free enzyme and the phosphate-bound enzyme of wild type and Asn80Asp GpdQ were assessed against the currently proposed structures. The findings in this chapter corroborate the proposed catalytic mechanism of GpdQ. In summary, this project led to a detailed understanding of the mechanism of GpdQ, and provided insight into how both the metal ion composition and the identity of the substrate may modulate this mechanism. The knowledge gained may lead to the design of catalytically more efficient derivatives (mutants) of GpdQ for application in bioremediation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycerophosphodiesterase</field><field name="subject">phosphoesterase</field><field name="subject">binuclear metallohydrolase</field><field name="subject">magnetic circular dichroism</field><field name="subject">stopped-flow fluorescence</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">electron paramagnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opposition to C. Julius Caesar: Motives, Methods, Successes and the Question of Tyranny.</field><field name="creator">Mark Avery</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the motives, methods and successes of opposition to C. Julius Caesar in the period 60-50 leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49. An attempt has been made to distinguish between traditional and innovative methods of opposition. An evaluation of creativity levels and the social acceptability of actions has been conducted in an effort to understand adherence to moral standards in the pre-war period. In Chapter 2, opposition to Caesar in 60 and 59 is examined and found to be fierce, persistent and, despite Caesar ultimately achieving his aims, successful in a limited way. Chapter 3 examines the circumstances of 58-57. Caesar&#8217;s position was more firmly secured through the agency of Clodius&#8217; tribunate, during which Cicero was exiled and Cato was removed from the political scene for both political and personal reasons. Examination of opposition to Caesar in Chapter 4 focuses on the period 56-54. It is demonstrated that prior to the conferences of Luca and Ravenna, opposition to Caesar was broadly undertaken by groups or individuals who fomented dissent between Crassus and Pompey in order to undermine the triumvirate as a whole. In 55 opposition to Caesar was nullified by a renewal of the triumvirate. In 54 opposition was resurgent and dominated the courts with limited success. In Chapter 5, opposition to Caesar in the period 53-50 is examined and is shown to be marked by anarchy, attempted reforms and the disintegration of the triumviral alliance. Given widespread impressions of pressure, corruption, violence and breakdown, especially in modern accounts of the period, it is suprising to discover that tactics used by Caesar&#8217;s opponents were traditional and socially acceptable for the most part, despite vehement political and personal disagreement. The will of the people was still respected by Caesar&#8217;s opponents; popular opinion in 59 was in fact the cause of opposition failure. While the Republic had suffered civil war in the opening decades of the first century BC, the state had resumed constitutional operation prior to 60. Traditional moral values and methods of gaining rank and prestige were still important and continued to be adhered to after 60. Methods of influence and social communication remained largely unchanged in the 50s, and ensured the continuity of political exchange without substantial innovation. From 56 to 54 opposition methods were opportunistic, a result of the renewal of the triumvirate. Caesar&#8217;s opponents continued to adhere to traditional political practice, despite dominance of the political machinary by the triumvirate. In 54 Caesar&#8217;s opponents gained control of the law courts, which resulted in numerous trials but no break with traditional or socially acceptable behaviour. Opposition between 53 and 50 remained traditional in most cases within an environment marked by anarchy and political stalemate, fueled by the intransigence of Caesar and Pompey who refused to recognise each others&#8217; dignitas. The Civil War, then, was not caused by an extended period of constitutional instability. The Civil War was the result of political deadlock at the end of the 50s, motivated by the social and political inflexibility of a small group of Senators.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">caesar, roman republic, politics, roman law, voting assemblies, roman senate, pompey, cicero, cato minor</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETIC ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT TRAITS FOR CONFECTIONERY SUNFLOWER IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Yue Sun</field><field name="description">Sunflower is grown worldwide for oil production. In Australia, sunflower is under intense competition from canola as an oil crop. Confectionery sunflower aimed for the overseas snack food market is a potential opportunity for Australian farmers due to its ability to provide off-season supply to the major market located mainly in the northern hemisphere. To serve this aim, new confectionery sunflower hybrids adapted to Australian production system with drought tolerance, large achenes, high self-fertility and rust resistance are of paramount importance. The objectives of this project were to understand the genetic inheritance and genetic linkage relationships of the above traits and also to identify linked DNA markers with the potential for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The inheritance of achene-length was studied in a 12 x 12 diallel and a 14 x 12 North Carolina design II (NC II) mating design. Achene-length was evaluated under three environments for each mating design. Genetic correlation among all five achene-size related traits (achene-length, -width, - thickness and also kernel-length and -width) and 100-achene weight were moderate to high. Narrow-and broad-sense heritability for achene-length was moderate to high and similar for each design. The general combining ability (GCA) and maternal effects were found to be the main genetic factors controlling achene-length and each accounted for around 45% of the total genotypic variance. The inheritance of self-fertility (SF) was assessed with the same 12 x 12 diallel mating design evaluated in two environments. The 12 parents also displayed various levels of SF in addition to a wide range of achene-length. Negative genetic correlations between SF and all five achene-size related traits and 100-achene weight were observed. Modelling achene-length as a covariate revealed that certain pre-pollination floret characteristics represented by achene-length at maturity strongly affects SF in sunflower. When the effect of achene-length was removed statistically as a covariate, the specific combining ability (SCA) effect increased dramatically and became the major factor (other than pre-pollination floret characteristics) for SF determination and accounted for 65% of the total variance. Long achene genotypes tended to have low SF and a positive SCA effect was observed more frequently in F1 hybrids that involved small achene lines. The broad sense heritability was moderate (0.663 &#177; 0.017), while the estimate of narrow-sense heritability was nearly zero. A segregating F6:7 recombinant inbred line population with 239 progeny was developed from a cross between HaR4, a low delta (&#916;), high transpiration efficiency (TE), sunflower line with rust resistance but relatively low SF, and SA52 with all the characteristics in the opposite direction. The population was evaluated in two environments for three TE-related traits including &#916;, specific leaf weight (SLW) and chlorophyll content (CC) and four agronomic traits i.e. days to flowering (DTF), plant height (PlantH), SF and rust resistance (RustR). A linkage map 1074.6 cM in length with 138 SSR and 37 ISSR markers consisting of 19 linkage groups was constructed. Spatially adjusted BLUPs were used in QTL analysis for individual and combined environments. Altogether, 10 QTL were identified for &#916;, SLW and CC at individual environments, and 7 were detected by a combined analysis. Sixteen QTL were identified for 4 agronomic traits and 14 of them were confirmed by a combined analysis. Significant linkage among all three TE related traits was discovered on linkage group 4 (LG4), where alleles from one parent had the same direction of influence on TE which suggested either coupling phase linkage or pleiotropy. QTL for SF and RustR were closely linked on LG13. An F2 population with 502 progeny developed from a cross between Jumbo, a large achene confectionery sunflower line, and RIL25, an oilseed small achene line, was evaluated for five achene-size related traits in a single field trial. Using a subset of 178 progeny a framework genetic linkage map, 899.7 cM in length, containing 128 SSR markers and 23 ISSR markers was constructed with 18 linkage groups. Based on the results of a simulated QTL analysis, a modified selective genotyping strategy was employed for QTL analysis with 178 F2 individuals (128 randomly selected, 25 shortest achene F2&#8217;s and 25 longest achene F2&#8217;s). Altogether 18 achene-size related QTL with small effects were identified. Achene-size related genes characteristically expressed additive gene action although several alleles were partially recessive towards the large achene parent. The 18 identified achene-size related QTL were validated in the same diallel mating experiment mentioned above. Significant marker-trait associations were detected for 15 QTL. In addition to 12 significant alleles detected from the F2 population, 12 additional alleles associated with achene-size traits were revealed after the analysis with the diallel. These markers are ready to be used in MAS for confectionery sunflower breeding. Great steps have been made in obtaining essential knowledge of inheritance and linkage of target traits for breeding confectionery sunflower adapted to Australian production environments. The identified markers can be used in MAS and further enhance the breeding process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confectionery sunflower</field><field name="subject">quantitative trait loci</field><field name="subject">combining ability</field><field name="subject">carbon isotope discrimination</field><field name="subject">specific leaf weight</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll content</field><field name="subject">achene size</field><field name="subject">kernel size</field><field name="subject">self-fertility</field><field name="subject">rust resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SELECTION FOR HEAT TOLERANCE IN JAPANESE QUAIL (Coturnix coturnix japonica)</field><field name="creator">Abdullaziz Al-abdullatif</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This study reports on the results of a selection experiment using Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) with the aim of assessing the impact of a number of selection regimes on tolerance to heat stress as measured by growth rate. Four lines were selected for six generations for increased weight gain from 14-28 days of age under either high (W, 32&#186;C) or normal (C, 25&#186;C) temperature conditions on either a high (H, 250 g/kg) or low (L, 150 g/kg) protein diet. Both diets contained 13.0 MJ ME/kg. The four selected lines were thus designated WH, CH, WL and CL. Fortnightly hatches were produced each generation from matings between 12 males and 36 females per line, with the parents of the next generation selected from approximately 100 birds per sex per line. A randomly selected control line (line C) of similar size was also maintained and reared in all cages with the selected line birds. Each generation, a third hatch of birds was reared and approximately 20 birds per line per environment were placed in single-bird cages to measure correlated responses in weight gain and feed efficiency in all four temperature/ dietary protein environments. In addition, correlated responses were measured in body composition and an assessment of the relative responses of the lines to early post-hatch epigenetic heat conditioning and to dietary addition of betaine (an osmolyte) were undertaken. The final study involved measurement of correlated response in the lines in the components of reproductive performance. On the high protein diet, response in growth rate relative to the control line in all selected lines was positive under both temperature environments, and by generations 5 and 6 growth rate was higher in the WH than in the CH line birds in both temperature environments. As weight gain was the selection criterion, these results suggest that selection for increased growth rate under high temperature conditions may not only be beneficial for progeny reared under high temperature conditions, but might also be at least as effective as selection under normal temperatures for progeny reared under normal temperature conditions. Whilst there was no equivalent advantage in feed efficiency in the WH line birds in either temperature environment, and the results arise from a comparison between un-replicated lines, they certainly indicate that such a selection approach is unlikely to have deleterious consequences. There was no benefit in either growth rate or feed efficiency under either temperature environments achieved through selection of birds on a low protein diet, irrespective of the selection temperature conditions. This indicates that irrespective of environmental temperature either during selection or subsequently, any possible advantage obtained through a reduction in the protein breakdown rate conferred through selection on a diet limiting in protein is outweighed by other factors contributing to a lower heritability and poorer response in these lines. In contrast to the WH line, the CH line birds in the normal temperature conditions were significantly (P&lt;0.01) leaner under high than normal temperature conditions, although these differences were not reflected in differences in feed efficiency. On the low protein diet, females were considerably fatter than males and the CL line birds had a considerably higher proportion of body fat than either their WL or C line counterparts. Responses in body composition emphasise the inadvisability of selecting birds for growth rate under protein deficient diets, particularly if they are expected to perform under high temperature conditions on either high or low protein diets. In a study of the effect of early post-hatch epigenetic heat conditioning on subsequent performance in the single-bird cages, half of the chicks from each line were exposed at 2 days of age to 38OC for 24 hours. The results of the study showed that there was a positive effect of heat conditioning, as measured by subsequent growth rate, in birds selected for increased growth rate under normal temperatures. However, selection for increased heat tolerance appeared to render the birds refractory to the beneficial effects of epigenetic conditioning. This suggests that the physiological pathways exploited by epigenetic heat conditioning are also utilised in selection for heat tolerance. Inclusion of betaine in the diet at 0.5 g/kg had a beneficial effect upon growth performance from 14-28 days of age in birds kept under high temperature conditions, but the degree of the effect was influenced by other factors possibly associated with the nutrient (and particularly the amino acid) composition of the diet. There was a lack of consistency in the relative responses of the lines to betaine supplementation indicating that it is unlikely that osmoprotection contributes in any meaningful way to heat tolerance expressed by the lines selected under high temperature conditions. A study of reproductive performance of the birds at generation six lent support to previous published findings showing deleterious effects upon the components of reproductive performance from selection for increased growth rate. There were, however, significant differences between the selection lines which suggested beneficial outcomes from selection for growth rate under moderately high temperature conditions, particularly in breeders housed under these same conditions. Relative to selection under normal temperatures, these benefits included: early onset of lay, increased egg production, increased egg weight and improved fertility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat tolerance, selection, Japanese quail</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Babylon Gets Rude: The Representation of Racial Violence in Black British Writing.</field><field name="creator">David Singh</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the representation of racial violence in black British literature. Long part of the black British experience, from racial murder to premeditated campaigns of harassment targeting individuals and families, and to police brutality, racial violence has curiously attracted next to no critical attention. This is particularly true of fictive representations, where black writers have sought to capture and convey the embodiment of racism and particularly the nature of what bell hooks has described as &#8220;white terror&#8221;. This thesis argues that this lacuna is a consequence of the concern to establish admixture, as expressed by terms such as hybridity, syncretism, and creolisation, as the central point of reference in discussions about black British identities. Triumphal accounts of British multiculturalism have followed the success of this paradigm, although some seek to partially solemnise the celebrations with merely passing references to the victims of real life racial murders. Abstract notions of &#8220;becoming&#8221; deflect attention from uninterrupted processes of forcible essentialisation from without, where the &#8220;other&#8221; serves as handmaiden to the formation of white subjectivities. This is the case with violent racism, where subjective violence, or physical violence, operates in tandem with symbolic violence, or racialised stereotypes, to essentialise the &#8220;victim&#8221;. In so doing the perpetrator rapidly arrives at a form of white racialised subjectivity which however must be continually refreshed through further symbolic or physical violence. As Pnina Werbner has argued, these experiences have ontological significance for the victim also and the communities for which the victim was taken be a representative. However this significance has been largely ignored, or at least bracketed, in accounts bent on celebrating &#8220;new ethnicities&#8221; and postcolonial London, an emerging disciplinary field which, in John McLeod&#8217;s words, examines the ways that the capital&#8217;s &#8220;transcultural facticity has made possible new communities and forms of culture&#8221; and which have the added effect of disrupting the &#8220;pastoral articulation of English national culture&#8221;. This thesis seeks to qualify the revelry that animates these accounts by foregrounding literary representations of racial violence and harassment. Each representation, drawn by writers who have been heralded as multiculturalism&#8217;s new baristas, serves as a reminder that multiculturalism is not without fierce contestation and that black lives, if not marked by violence, are still very much at risk of being targeted in this way. The novels examined include: Diran Adebayo&#8217;s Some Kind of Black; David Dabydeen&#8217;s The Intended; Hanif Kureishi&#8217;s The Black Album ; Caryl Phillips&#8217;s A Distant Shore ; and Courttia Newland&#8217;s The Scholar. Writing myself into the thesis as a socially situated reader, each novel will be examined with a concern to highlight the representation of racial violence; the spatial significance of representations; responses to racial victimisation; and the &#8220;whiteness&#8221; at work in racist violence. Using interdisciplinary resources the thesis will attempt to build a theory of white subjectivity and racial violence and throughout there will be an overarching concern to determine whether these works articulate an anti-racist position and, if so, what this may be taken to say about black tenure in multicultural Britain.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">britain, identity, literature, multiculturalism, racism, violence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Approaches to the Development of Koala Sperm Cryopreservation Techniques</field><field name="creator">Yeng Zee</field><field name="description">The primary objective of the studies described in this thesis was to improve the cryopreservation success of koala spermatozoa for the purpose of establishing a genome resource bank for this species. A defining feature of the studies in this thesis was the implementation of an organelle-specific approach to better understand the causes of koala sperm cryo-injury. The functional attributes of spermatozoa, such as mitochondrial function, plasma membrane fluidity, membrane lipid asymmetry and DNA integrity were assessed as an indication of cryo-injury. Sperm mitochondrial function and plasma membrane integrity were examined by cryomicroscopy using the fluorescent probes JC-1 and propidium iodide (PI) respectively in a dual staining technique. Cooling and re-warming koala spermatozoa were more detrimental to mitochondrial function than to plasma membrane integrity. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was suppressed by freezing and thawing treatments; after thawing, MMP declined significantly during rewarming (from 5&#186;C to 35&#186;C). The distribution of GM1 ganglioside was examined using fluorescent-labelled cholera toxin B. No significant redistribution of GM1 was observed after chilling or cryotreatment. The externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) was examined using fluorescent-labelled annexin V. There was no significant increase in translocation of PS after chilling or cryopreservation. These observations imply that cryotreatment had little effect on plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Koala spermatozoa were incubated in a range of anisotonic media to investigate whether nuclear swelling was caused by osmotic flux during the cryopreservation process. Although the most hypotonic solution tested (64 mOsm/kg) induced the highest incidence of nuclear relaxation (mean &#177; SEM; 12 &#177; 3%), this was not as severe as that previously documented following cryopreservation. Chromatin relaxation is a phenomenon observed in koala spermatozoa, where the sperm nucleus expands due to the result of structural changes in the natural conformation of the sperm DNA/protamine complex. DNA fragmentation was not a primary cause of cryopreservation-induced sperm chromatin relaxation, although in situ nick translation of putative DNA breaks indicated that these increased as the sperm head became progressively more relaxed. Using a Sperm Chromatin Dispersion test (SCDt) specifically developed and validated for koala spermatozoa, a continuum of nuclear morphotypes was observed, ranging from no apparent DNA fragmentation to spermatozoa with highly dispersed and degraded chromatin. A double comet assay was also developed to investigate DNA fragmentation in the koala spermatozoa. Conducted under neutral followed by alkaline conditions, this assay was able to differentiate between single- (SSB) and double-stranded (DSB) DNA damage in an effort to refine the interpretation of DNA damage in mature koala spermatozoa; the majority of the koala spermatozoa had nuclei with DNA abasic-like residues. The ubiquity of these residues suggested that constitutive alkali-labile sites are part of the structural configuration of the koala sperm nucleus. Spermatozoa with &#8220;true&#8221; DNA fragmentation exhibited a continuum of comet morphologies, ranging from a more severe form of alkaline-susceptible DNA, to nuclei that exhibited both SSB and DSB. Swelling of koala sperm chromatin following cryopreservation has largely been attributed to the absence of inter-molecular disulphide cross-linkages in the marsupial sperm nucleus. Fish spermatozoa also lack disulphide bonds within their chromatin, but nevertheless, have been successfully cryopreserved. To examine the hypothesis that the cryoprotectants used for fish sperm cryopreservation will confer a similar degree of protection on koala spermatozoa, various concentrations of five cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and dimethylacetamide) were evaluated. Each treatment was compared against an established koala sperm cryopreservation protocol that uses 14% glycerol. Dimethylacetamide at a concentration of 12.5% (v/v) was found to be comparable to glycerol in the successful cryopreservation of koala spermatozoa although high inter-male variability was observed. However, when the new protocol was subsequently validated for a larger population of captive koalas (n = 22), glycerol emerged the better cryoprotectant with respect to all sperm viability parameters assessed except for that of the incidence of chromatin relaxation, which was not affected by the cryoprotectant. Significant difference was also observed in the post-thaw survival of spermatozoa from different animals, which was independent of pre-freeze semen quality. Based on post-thaw semen viability parameters, the koalas could be divided into two distinct groups, where one group had significantly higher sperm viability compared to the other group, regardless of cryoprotectant used. Positive correlation between motility and MMP was observed before and after cryopreservation. However, cryopreservation significantly reduced the dependency between these variables (P &lt; 0.001), suggesting that cryopreservation reduced the dependency between mitochondrial function and motility.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marsupial, spermatozoa, cryopreservation, mitochondrial function, cryodamage, DNA fragmentation, chromatin relaxation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Social Networks in High Performance Football Coaching</field><field name="creator">Joseph Occhino</field><field name="description">Abstract Increasing global interest in coaching science research has resulted in a greater recognition of the complexities and dynamics existing in the coaching process (Cushion, Armour, &amp; Jones, 2003). Associated with the dynamic and complex nature of the coaching process are the many social relationships that operate within this process. A high performance coach&#8217;s network is often associated with athletes, officials, support staff and administrators. In essence, coaches form dynamic social networks (DSN; (Mallett, Rossi, &amp; Tinning, 2007) that are paramount to developing their coaching practice, and therefore their coaching knowledge. The aim of this project was to understand how high performance football coaches (HPFC) learn. The research questions were as follows: &#8226; What are the major sources of information for HPFC? &#8226; What sources of information are most valuable to the HPFC? &#8226; What role does the interaction with other coaches&#8217; play in developing knowledge? In order to better understand the nature of coach interactions in developing knowledge it is useful to consider the notions of communities of practice (CoP) (Wenger, 1998), networks of practice (NoP) (Nichani &amp; Hung, 2002), informal knowledge networks (IKN) (Allee, 2000) and dynamic social networks (DSN) (Mallett, et al., 2007). This qualitative research was conducted with six high performance football coaches (HPFC) in Australia using semi-structured interviews. Each interview was transcribed and analysed into meaning units through the process of triangular consensus. The coaches in this sample did not display a fully functioning CoP, IKN, or NoP. The HPFCs failed to display the critical element of a joint enterprise. Mutual engagement was partially reported between coaches of the same team but was not reported between opposition coaches. The coaches reported the final element of a shared repertoire. Nichani &amp; Hung&#8217;s (2002) notion of a NoP and Allee&#8217;s (2000) research on IKN were considered as possible social networks to describe the coaching context. These coaches did not develop relationships that could be characterised as a NoP. The data suggests that the development of knowledge through face-to-face interactions with other people was valued over use of Internet exchanges and chat rooms. There was evidence to suggest the formation of a coaches&#8217; IKN, however it is proposed that this was not the major source for these coaches in developing knowledge. Most importantly it was found that HPFC in the Australian context are engaged in a DSN. It was reported by the coaches in this study that their interactions are dynamic, in that they change throughout their careers to the extent that their people of influence can be numerous; this is due to two key findings. The nature of the work of HPFC is highly contested and thus the information and knowledge is sacred. This is a barrier for information and knowledge transfer and can inhibit learning. In addition finding a person of influence is a lengthy process as it can take years to build mutual trust and respect. By understanding how coaches learn their craft through their interactions with others, coach development could potentially assist coaches through the learning process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coaching knowledge, communities of practice, knowledge networks, football coaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Foot Orthoses in Anterior Knee Pain</field><field name="creator">Natalie Collins</field><field name="description">Anterior knee pain (AKP) is a common, chronic lower limb musculoskeletal overuse condition that represents substantial morbidity to those affected, and has a significant impact on the health care industry. Health practitioners frequently prescribe foot orthoses in the management of AKP as an alternative or adjunct to multimodal physiotherapy. The primary aim of this thesis was to investigate the clinical efficacy of foot orthoses in AKP, utilising high-quality research methodologies. The two systematic reviews conducted have identified a significant gap in the literature regarding evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) for foot orthoses in AKP and other lower limb overuse conditions. While the best evidence for AKP management was for multimodal physiotherapy, there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of foot orthoses in the treatment of lower limb overuse conditions, including AKP. Meta-analysis provided evidence to support the use of foot orthoses in the prevention of the first incidence of lower limb overuse conditions. An interesting finding was evidence from pooled and individual study data of no difference between custom and prefabricated foot orthoses in both treatment and prevention of lower limb overuse conditions, inferring that either type of orthosis may be utilised. Both systematic reviews highlighted substantial methodological flaws of the included studies, and recommended that future studies include larger participant numbers, longer participant follow-up, more consistent use of reliable and valid outcome measures and reporting of outcome data, and utilisation of the CONSORT guidelines in the design and reporting of RCTs. A 12-month prospective RCT investigated the short- and long-term clinical efficacy of prefabricated foot orthoses in the treatment of 179 participants with AKP. Foot orthoses were more effective than flat shoe inserts in the short term, implying that their contoured form has some therapeutic effect. Foot orthoses were not significantly different to multimodal physiotherapy over 12 months, nor was there any benefit in adding foot orthoses to physiotherapy. Considering that all groups experienced clinically meaningful long-term improvements in pain and function, clinicians may prescribe foot orthoses for AKP to hasten recovery. Findings of post-hoc analyses to develop a clinical prediction rule indicate that those of older age and shorter height, who have a lower severity of AKP and a more mobile midfoot, are more than twice as likely to experience a successful outcome with foot orthoses. As a secondary aim, this thesis has provided a more comprehensive profile of AKP as a condition. Baseline data from the RCT participants confirms previous reports of higher rates of AKP in females, and a tendency towards bilaterality and chronicity. This AKP sample did not differ from asymptomatic individuals in terms of body mass index, physical activity level, general and mental health, and foot posture, although they tended to have a more mobile foot under load. These characteristics tend to be homogenous across a number of published RCTs, indicating that the findings of the RCT described above are likely to be generalisable to the broader population with AKP. An additional finding in this group was that those with AKP of long duration, higher pain levels, lower functional levels, and an overall lower score on a specific measure of AKP have a poorer prognosis over 12 months, irrespective of their age, gender or morphometry. These findings suggest that, in order to improve prognosis and the chance of a successful outcome, the primary goals of intervention should be to reduce the severity and duration of AKP, through the use of early intervention with foot orthoses, multimodal physiotherapy, or a combination of the two.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anterior knee pain</field><field name="subject">Patellofemoral pain syndrome</field><field name="subject">Foot orthoses</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Randomised clinical trial</field><field name="subject">Systematic review</field><field name="subject">Clinical prediction rule</field><field name="subject">Evidence-based practice</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What motivates the motivators? The development of the Coach Motivation Questionnaire (CMQ)</field><field name="creator">Kristy Mclean</field><field name="description">Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT; Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985), the motivation of sports coaches and the development of the Coach Motivation Questionnaire (CMQ) are the subject of this thesis. Motivation contributes to the way in which people think, feel, and act, and is therefore a central issue in the study of psychology (Ryan &amp; Deci, 2000b). The motivational sequence (Vallerand, 1997) suggests that coaches&#8217; motivations influence their behaviours, which subsequently have an effect on their athletes&#8217; perceptions of the motivational climate. In the sport domain, the coach-athlete relationship is one of the most important influences on athletes&#8217; motivation and subsequent performance (Mageau &amp; Vallerand, 2003). Nevertheless, while there is much research concentrating on the impact of coaching behaviours on athletes&#8217; perceptions and performance, little thought seems to have been given to the coaches&#8217; needs themselves (Mageau &amp; Vallerand, 2003). Following previous work with athletes (e.g., Frederick-Recascino &amp; Schuster-Smith, 2003), the motives and motivational styles of coaches should be related to how they behave within the coaching environment (Frederick &amp; Morrison, 1999). In other words, why coaches coach should influence how coaches coach. The present investigation was conducted to further research and understanding of coach motivation. In the pursuit of this aim, the following three studies were conducted. In Study 1, the motivation of Australian coaches was examined, with a view to informing the development of a valid measurement tool. Employing a qualitative methodology, 13 coaches from different sports and levels of competition participated in semi-structured interviews. Inductive content analysis of the interview transcripts yielded four key dimensions: (a) connection with sport, (b) coach and athlete development, (c) external influences, and (d) internal motives. Overall, SDT appeared to be a useful lens for understanding the data and the existence of multiple forms of motivation were discussed. Study 2 involved the development and pilot testing of a pool of potential items for the CMQ. These items reflected each of the six forms of motivation as conceptualised in SDT, and were designed to be broad and applicable to a wide range of coaches and coaching scenarios. Coaches (N = 86) completed the extended version of the CMQ online, and were requested to respond to two open-ended questions designed to gauge the face validity and general clarity of the questionnaire content. Results suggested that motivation factors were internally consistent, however empirical and qualitative feedback suggested the adaptation of one item for conceptual clarity and the removal of a second item resulting in the CMQ-41. The psychometric properties of the CMQ were examined in Study 3. Coaches (N = 556) completed an online questionnaire package that included the CMQ and measures of psychological needs, goal orientation, and well-being. Examination using CFA produced a 22-item measure with good model fit. Further evaluation produced preliminary evidence for the scale&#8217;s validity and reliability. The implications of these results for researchers and practitioners are discussed. Directions for research concerning coach motivation, SDT, and the coach-athlete performance relationship are also highlighted.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coaching</field><field name="subject">Self-determination theory</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Scale development</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Mauritian Creole Noun Phrase: Its Form and Function</field><field name="creator">Diana Guillemin</field><field name="description">Early in the genesis of Mauritian Creole (MC), the quantificational determiners of its lexifier language, French, incorporated into a large number of the nouns that they combined with, resulting in the occurrence of bare nouns in argument positions, yielding (in)definite, singular, plural and generic interpretations. These early changes were accompanied by the loss all inflectional morphology, as well as the loss of the French copula, and that of the Case assigning prepositions &#224; ('of') and de ('of') which are used in partitive and genitive constructions respectively. I argue that these changes triggered a parametric shift in noun denotation, from predicative in French to argumental in MC, and account for the fact that MC has a very different determiner system from its lexifier. My analysis is motivated by both Longobardi's (1994) claim that only DPs can be arguments, NPs cannot, and Chierchia's (1998b) seemingly incompatible claim that N can be an argument when it is Kind denoting. I provide detailed account of the emergence of the new MC determiners, from their first attestations in the early 18th century, to the end of the 19th century, when the determiner system settles into a form that is still used today. Following an analysis of the modern MC determiner system, I propose that MC nouns are lexically stored as argumental, Kind denoting terms, which share some of the distributional properties of English bare plurals, such as their ability to occur in argument positions without a determiner. The new quantificational determiners are analyzed as 'type shifting operators' that shift Kinds and predicate nominals into argumental noun phrases. The singular indefinite article enn and the plural marker bann assign existential quantification over instances of Kind denoting count nouns, and the null definite determiner is an operator that quantifies over the totality of a set. The differential behaviour of MC count vs. mass nouns is accounted for in terms of the Number argument which must be realized for common count nouns. Some seemingly 'bare' nouns comprise a phonologically null definite determiner equivalent to French le/la and English the. Subject-object asymmetry of count nouns in MC provides evidence for the occurrence of this null element which requires licensing in certain syntactic environments. The Specificity marker la, which serves to mark anaphoric definiteness, is shown to be a 'last resort' means of licensing the null definite determiner. My syntactic analysis is within Chomsky's (1995b) Minimalist framework and a Formal Semantics (Partee 1986), both of which stipulate legitimate operator variable constructions. The loss of the French quantificational determiners, and that of the copula meant that early MC lacked overt sources of quantification at both the nominal and clausal levels. In my analysis of the emerging MC determiner system, I look at the new sources of quantification that arise in order to establish the referential properties of nouns, and I show how these various strategies are linked to the means by which the semantic features of Definiteness, Deixis, Number and Specificity are expressed, and also the means by which the syntactic function of predication is realized.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">200406 Language in Time and Space (incl.

Carbonaceous materials (CM) have been isolated from three rock packages of mid to early Archaean age from the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. This CM has been subjected to a multidisciplinary approach utilising a variety of analytical and observational techniques, in an attempt to establish the occurrence, associations, mineral affinities, historical environments of growth, and the metamorphic/thermal history experienced by what may be some of the earliest, relatively pristine record of 3500 million year old life on this planet. CM isolated from drillcore obtained from the first of these localities, the 3.24 Ga Sulphur Springs volcanic hosted massive sulphide (VHMS) deposit, occurs as isotopically light (&#948;13C values of &#8722;34.0 &#8240; to &#8722;26.8 &#948;13C) finely striated, lenticular to banded material emplaced parallel to original sedimentary bedding planes within the fine-grained silicified epiclastic hanging wall sediments. Petrological and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations have revealed well-preserved bundles of filamentous and tubular structured microbial remains closely resembling both modern-day and more ancient microbial forms documented from sea floor hydrothermal environments. Total organic carbon (TOC) has a range of &lt;1.0 to 2.3 %, while the thermal maturity (%Ro) of the filamentous bundles points to maximum temperatures since deposition of around 90&#8211;100 &#176;C, a factor that has enabled the preservation of their morphology. These results are suggestive of a well-developed Archaean sediment-hosted microbial community, situated within a basinal environment associated with an active centre of seafloor hydrothermal activity. The majority of the CM isolated from drillcore samples of the second locality, the 3.46 Ga Salgash Subgroup, a lower member of the Apex Basalt, also appears as in situ, bedding parallel bands intercalated with foliated altered argillaceous sandstone beds. TOC of the samples ranges from 1.25 to 11.48 %, while carbon content varies from 2.05 to 32.17 %. &#948;13C results are relatively heavy, varying from -30.4 to -22.5 &#8240;. Thermal maturity indicators of 10-13 %Ro suggest the CM having been subjected to temperatures greater than normally obtained from processes associated with burial. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results showed this CM in a highly ordered graphitic state. Optically, the graphite lacks the typical pronounced anisotropy characterising graphites in metamorphic terranes. Graphitisation therefore, is likely the result of rapid heating at very high temperature. HRTEM of this material revealed an extremely high level of molecular ordering contemporaneous with the presence of the C60 fullerene molecules within carbon nanotubes. These forms are a key to the distinction between biologically and abiotically synthesized CM, both by their small size and their resistance to thermal degradation. The occurrence of these carbon forms in terrestrial deposits is rare, and usually associated with wildfires, lighting strike or meteoritic impact. In the case of the Salgash CM, the formation of these molecules and the isotropic graphitised state of the CM is interpreted as a result of emplacement under pressure of very high temperature (komatiitic/ peridotite) lavas. The thermal overprint of the CM by such a high temperature process resulted in the volatilisation of the organic material, destruction of any primary biological morphology and the subsequent reorganisation of the residual CM, resulting in increased molecular ordering. In the third part of the study, CM isolated from drillcore samples of the ca. 3.5 Ga Dresser Formation bedded black chert-barite units, occurs in both dispersed and layered forms, interlayered with fine-grained silica. The intimate association of the CM and silica strongly resembles silicified microbial colonies from active hydrothermal systems, which have been previously proposed as analogues of Archaean hydrothermal sites. Isotopically light &#948;13C values from -38.2 to -32.1 &#8240;, and the association of C, H, and N, are highly indicative of a biological origin for the material. Palaeotemperatures calculated from &#948;18O isotope analysis of quartz chips indicate a depositional temperature for the hydrothermal veins ranging from ~120 &#176;C to ~200 &#176;C. 207Pb-206Pb isotope analyses conducted on pyrites extracted from the interbedded barite units reveal a dual MORB and Erosion mix source for the Pb, which gives an average 207Pb/206Pb age of 3531&#177;42 Ma for the deposit. Ro measurements reveal four distinct CM populations, defined as ACM, A1CM, BCM, and CCM, which represent temperatures ranging from 170 &#176;C to potentially &gt;400 &#176;C. TEM and HRTEM observations of the lower temperature CM population show morphological entities strongly suggestive of microbial remains, including possible cell wall remnants. Higher Ro rank CM commonly fills or coats mineral grains and lacks distinguishable structures, which is consistent with an increased thermal degradation /hydrothermal overprint. The geological setting and mineralogy of the Dresser Formation endorse its formational history as a silica-barite dominated seafloor hydrothermal deposit, most likely analogous to modern &#8220;white smokers&#8221;. The occurrence of the predominant CM (type ACM) in more or less continuous bands and laminae within the sedimentary rocks suggest an in situ, syndepositional source for the majority of this material, whereas the dispersed nature of type BCM particles indicates a recycled nature. The occurrence of type CCM within fluid inclusions gives an insight into the primary morphology of the non-degraded original microbial cells that may have existed at that time. These observations, combined with the carbon isotopic heterogeneity and fractionations are suggestive of chemosynthetic microbes occupying a seafloor hydrothermal system where rapid silicification at relatively low temperature preserved the CM. Finally, in an effort to further understand the CM structures observed in the rocks of the Dresser Formation in the context of present day microbial colonies in similar environments, a comparative morphological study was conducted using a potential modern analogue derived from an active seafloor hydrothermal environment. Such methodology utilises the standard classification used in biological species identification, which is initially based on visual identification of specific features, whether by the naked eye, light microscopy or electron microscopy. The extant hyperthermophilic microbe Methanocaldococcus jannaschii was cultured under conditions similar to the Archaean seafloor, simulating an increased thermal maturity by artificially induced autoclaving at 100 &#176;C (1 atm) and 132 &#176;C (2 atm). A striking resemblance to the early Archaean forms observed in the Dresser CM was evident in both wall structure and thermal degradation mode of the cultured microbe. Cell disintegration of the cultures occurred at 100 &#176;C marking the limits of life, whereas complete disintegration, deformation and shrinkage of the cells occurred at 132 &#176;C. These comparative observations present as a feasible way of understanding the structural features in CM identified in Archaean sedimentary packages.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">04 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Archaean</field><field name="subject">Pilbara craton,</field><field name="subject">carbonaceous matter</field><field name="subject">carbon isotopes</field><field name="subject">early life</field><field name="subject">Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Filling the Eighteenth-Century Void for Violists: A Study of Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Viola&#8221; Concerto, K. 622.</field><field name="creator">Frank Fodor</field><field name="description">Until such players as Lionel Tertis improved the status of their instrument in the twentieth century, violists have had to rely to a considerable extent on arrangements to help redress the void which exists in viola literature (when compared with the extensive repertory of many other instruments), a gap that is particularly apparent in the eighteenth century. One such example is the arrangement of Mozart&#8217;s Clarinet Concerto, K. 622 for solo viola. During the twentieth century, a small number of arrangements were made of this composition for viola; however, among the most interesting is an anonymous arrangement made only eleven years after the composer&#8217;s death, in 1802, by the German publishing firm Johann Anton Andr&#233;. This paper identifies the extant sources for the original clarinet version of the work, followed by an examination of the 1802 Andr&#233; arrangement. A comparison of the latter with an arrangement for viola by Lionel Tertis dating from the 1940s will also be made, with each version discussed in light of the culture, techniques and performance practices of its period, alongside a consideration of the overall feasibility of this work for the viola.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mozart</field><field name="subject">viola</field><field name="subject">clarinet</field><field name="subject">concerto</field><field name="subject">K622</field><field name="subject">arrangement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Evaluation and Carer Burden Assessment of a Self-Administered Home Parenteral Therapy Program</field><field name="creator">Gail Neilson</field><field name="description">Statement of Problem In the past few years, there has been increased interest in the intravenous administration of antibiotics in the home. The catalyst for this interest has been the need to contain costs and decrease surgical waiting lists in hospitals. However, the scientific evidence for cost containment for home parenteral programs is scant, conflicting and confusing. This study is the first to undertake an economic model based on a cost-benefit framework encompassing both direct and the often-ignored indirect costs. It also examines patient self-administered home parenteral antibiotic therapy (HPAT) within an economic, clinical and humanistic outcomes (ECHO) structure as a source of model inputs. The modelling approach overcomes the analytical and statistical difficulties associated with these early discharge programs due to the small and diverse nature of the populations. Methods and Procedures This study uses data from the Alternate Site Infusion Service (ASIS) at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Australia to populate some fields in the economic model. This service is based on the patient self-administration model and provides early hospital discharge to medically stable patients who require medium to long-term intravenous antibiotics for the treatment of infectious disease. The economic model is described as a probabilistic, second-order, Monte Carlo simulation based on cost-benefit design and constructed from realistic incremental differences in costs and benefits. The multi-dimensional probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to account for uncertainty present in some of the model inputs. Risk analysis software known as &#8220;@Risk&#8221; Version 4.5.5 Professional is used to construct the simulation model. The cost and benefit framework, and ultimately inputs, are constructed from primary data emanating from the databases of the ASIS unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane for the period 2001 to 2002, secondary data based on literature reviews, and expert opinion. Societal perspective is chosen to encompass areas such as loss or gain of productivity and carer burden. Clinical outcome is investigated by examining the ASIS database regarding the treatment outcome of HPAT patients. The incidence and mortality rates of nosocomial intravascular bacteraemia (NIB) for hospital and HPAT patients are based on the literature review and included as inputs in the model. Carer burden is determined by the identified carers of ASIS patients with the completion of the mailed Caregiving Distress Scale (CDS) and the Impact of Caring Scale (ICS) instruments. A labour questionnaire was designed to collect data on paid employment, students returning to education and individuals returning to normal daily activities (including forgone leisure activities). The Australian Bureau of Statistics&#8217; (ABS) Australian Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) and the ABS gender-specific average weekly wages for nine major work groups are used to estimate productivity of patients and their carers. The value of a hospital bed day was modelled to estimate the value of hospitalisation at the end of a hospital length of stay to avoid using an average bed day cost. The change in the utilisation of nursing, medical and pharmacy human resources due to HPAT is also modelled to avoid using average estimates. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the value of a hospital bed day to measure the impact on the net benefit. Results The @Risk economic model was undertaken with 10,000 iterations to capture the variability of the net benefit. The value of a hospital bed day appears to have the greatest impact on the net benefit of ASIS with the probability of NIB and incidence of death from NIB in hospital also contributing. The correlation of CDS and the ICS demonstrates a linear relationship, and a total of 93% of carers indicate that they would repeat their participation as a carer. However, most relationships between variables are not statistically significant, or clinically unimportant. Carer burden is suggested to be low in home parenteral antibiotic patients despite the ASIS unit adopting the patient self-administered form of service delivery. However, the number of patients identifying a carer is low and, therefore, there is difficulty in the collection of a suitable sized data set. HPAT failed in 10% of home patients and was fairly comparable with other studies based on the patient self-administered model of service delivery. A total of 58% of HPAT patients (total patients = 123 and 3,939 bed days) returned to work or normal activities with an estimated productivity gain of $190,045 for the economic model of 3,964 bed days. Lost productivity for carers emanating from the survey research was estimated to be $118,121 for the economic model of 3,964 bed days. A mean cost difference of $19,584 between the hospital and home NIB, based on literature probability rates, was estimated indicating a benefit to the HPAT with regard to NIB. Overall, the @Risk model for the ASIS patients representing 3,964 bed days calculated a mean net benefit of $2,450,163 for the HPAT program. A 50% reduction in a hospital bed day value to $253 still resulted in a mean net benefit of $1,447,273 &#8211; and a zero net benefit resulted when the value of a hospital bed day reached $112. This suggests that the HPAT program, based on a patient self-administered model of service delivery, represents a viable option for healthcare delivery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Economic, modelling, simulation, cost benefit, home parenteral therapy, carer burden</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cochlear Implant Outcomes in Adults with Prelingual Hearing Impairment</field><field name="creator">Andrea Caposecco</field><field name="description">Speech perception outcomes for people with a prelingual hearing loss, implanted with a cochlear implant in adolescence or adulthood, are characterized by a large degree of variability. Research findings indicate that some recipients do very well and gain significant open set speech perception skills, whilst a large percentage show little or no change in open set speech results, post implant. In studies to-date, mean speech perception scores were typically substantially poorer than those recorded for implant recipients with a postlingual hearing loss. Despite this, the majority of recipients with a prelingual hearing loss implanted with a cochlear implant in adolescence or adulthood reported satisfaction with their implant and used it regularly. Although there have been a number of studies in the area, none has taken a holistic approach and investigated both objective and subjective outcomes for a large group of participants. In addition, no study has employed a multiple regression analysis to investigate which characteristics were associated with speech perception outcomes in people with a prelingual hearing loss implanted with a cochlear implant in adolescence or adulthood. The objectives of the study were to examine speech perception and other outcomes in people with a bilateral prelingual or perilingual hearing loss, implanted with a cochlear implant as an adolescent or adult, and to investigate prognostic factors associated with positive outcomes. The design consisted of a retrospective review of both speech perception outcomes and other outcomes for 38 recipients, diagnosed with a bilateral hearing loss before age 3, and implanted with a cochlear implant at 14 years or older. There were 24 females and 14 males and the average age at initial stimulation was 33 years. All participants were implanted with a Nucleus device at a private audiology clinic (Attune). Four questionnaires were completed by approximately half of the participants &#8211; Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI); International Outcome Inventory (IOI-CI); Study Questionnaire; and the Hearing Abilities and Quality of Life Scale. The Study Questionnaire was developed specifically for this project and investigated satisfaction, benefit and advantages/disadvantages of the implant. The Hearing Abilities and Quality of Life Scale was developed by Attune and was completed by recipients pre and post implant. It evaluated the ability to understand conversation in different situations, environmental awareness, safety concerns, involvement in social activities and impact of the hearing loss on relationships. Approximately one third of participants scored between 30 and 90% on the CID/ CUNY test administered via CD post implant and approximately one fifth scored over 90%. The mean score on the CID/CUNY test administered via CD was 8% pre implant and 48% post implant. Over 80% of recipients used their device more than 8 hours a day and all recipients reported being satisfied with it. Three factors accounted for 65% of the variance on the open set sentence test score, post implant. These were stable versus progressive loss, mode of communication in childhood and time without a hearing aid on the implant ear. For the purposes of this research, a &#8216;stable&#8217; loss was defined as a bilateral severe to profound hearing loss at diagnosis and a &#8216;progressive&#8217; loss was one that deteriorated to this degree at some point after diagnosis. The findings from this study reveal that a cochlear implant is a viable option for adults and adolescents with a prelingual hearing loss. The majority of participants gained benefit from the device and were satisfied with it. In addition, a substantial number gained good open set speech perception ability, post implant. Consistent with previous studies, there was large intersubject variability in speech scores. The recipients who had a progressive loss, used oral communication in childhood and wore a hearing aid on the implant ear up to the time of surgery were more likely to obtain better speech perception outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">outcomes</field><field name="subject">cochlear implant</field><field name="subject">adult</field><field name="subject">prelingual hearing impairment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Light attenuation, phytoplankton and epiphyte diversity as a function of water quality in post flood and recolonising seagrass habitats in Hervey Bay, Queensland.</field><field name="creator">Deborah Milham Scott</field><field name="description">The quest to discover simple, sensitive and global bioindicators of nutrient enrichment and ecological health continues. The present study is the first to address this quest in Hervey Bay by investigating links between key physico-chemical water quality parameters and two diatom forms. Free floating in the water column as phytoplankton, and attached to seagrass leaves and artificial substrates as microalgal epiphytes, diatoms are assessed for their abundance and diversity along an environmental gradient. Relationships between Secchi depth (Zsd), light attenuation coefficient (Kz) and minimum seagrass compensation depth (Zc) are established for the recovery, growth and survival of aquatic plants following disturbance, with equations derived specifically for this region to allow conversions from Zsd to Kz. These relationships allow predictions to be made and provide a management tool to meet water quality targets and combat elevated nutrient and sediment loads that result from anthropogenic activity and affect all marine life, from microalgae to marine mammals. Environmental links, identified as drivers of change to biodiversity, focus research effort and provide predictive management tools. Consequently, catchment and coastal activities such as dredging, construction and canal development, with the potential to increase nutrient and sediment loads, can be managed and scheduled at times least likely to adversely impact near shore ecosystems and therefore improve the balance between growth and sustainability. Seasonal and zone differences were significant for many of the water quality parameters monitored in Hervey Bay during 1994. Water clarity measures consistently showed significant differences between near and offshore zones (Secchi depth; P&lt;0.01, turbidity; P&lt;0.05 and TSS; P&lt;0.01) as well as oxygen (P&lt;0.01), soluble reactive phosphate (SRP, P&lt;0.05), oxides of nitrogen (NOx, P&lt;0.01), chlorophyll a (Chl a, P&lt;0.01) and pH (P&lt;0.01). Some default trigger values for water quality targets listed by ANZECC/ARMCANZ (2000) for concentrations of key indicators, a threshold for risk of adverse biological effects, were exceeded in dry and flood periods during the 1993 to 1995 survey. The community structure of phytoplankton and seagrass epiphytes were examined by monitoring changes to and 35 seagrass epiphyte species coincident with changes in some key water quality parameters along a water quality gradient. Chl a, Secchi depth (Zsd), soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) and pH were found to be the best subset of water quality parameters to maximise the rank correlation with phytoplankton communities whereas NOx and temperature maximised the rank correlation with the Halophila ovalis seagrass epiphyte communities. These parameters statistically link key water quality parameters to changes in phytoplankton and seagrass epiphyte density and assemblage structure and are supported as significant drivers of change in biodiversity research. Evidence for nitrogen limitation was found in the post flood surveys for phytoplankton and the growth and assemblage structure for seagrass systems and their epiphytes. Seasonal and zone differences in phytoplankton assemblage structure were most apparent with some site influence detected. Cylindrotheca closterium dominated the phytoplankton assemblage structure at the near shore zone while Thalassionema nitzschioides and Chaetoceros sp. differentiated the river from the Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) creek site. Rhizolsolenia and Guinardia sp. were found in significantly higher concentrations at offshore sites (P &lt; 0.01) and Thalassionema nitzschioides (P &lt; 0.01), Thalassiosira sp. (P &lt; 0.01) and Pseudonitzschia sp. (P &lt; 0.05) were found in significantly higher abundance in the near shore zone A Trichodesmium bloom was examined and post flood changes to the phytoplankton assemblage structure associated with increased nutrient loads, reduced water clarity (Secchi depth, TSS and turbidity) and changes to pH and salinity were assessed. The results of analyses of variance provided support to multivariate statistical analyses to identify phytoplankton as a useful and sensitive bioindicator of environmental change. Post flood phytoplankton cell density increased and species diversity rose from 10 to 38 species at the Mary River mouth however, the changes to cell density and assemblage structure were not reflected in Chl a concentrations. The Mary River mouth experienced growth of mainly small phytoplankton species (&lt; 20 &#181;m) while Pulgul Creek, a source of WWTP effluent, experienced a disproportional increase in the larger phytoplankton species (&gt;20&#181;m). The increase in phytoplankton cell density at offshore sites occurred for both large and small species. Phytoplankton species dominance changed at each site during the postflood period. C. closterium remained the dominant species but increased from 34 to 648 cells/mL at Pulgul Creek however, C. similis, the second most dominant species was replaced by Pseudonitszchia sp., whose cell density rose from 2.0 to 320 cells/mL. A recent study also found that Cylindrotheca closterium, Skeletonema costatum, and Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana had strong positive relationships with coastal nutrients and suggested these species be used as potential reliable indicators of eutrophication (Toming and Jaanus, 2007). Some Pseudonitszchia sp. and dinoflagellate species have previously been noted as toxic and Chaetoceros sp. are associated with gill damage and fish kills. Rhizosolenia sp. and the Guinardia species G. flaccida and G. striatula, were indicators for the offshore relatively pristine sites, which may conversely, determine these species as indicators of environmental health in this waterway. Specificity of epiphyte attachment to particular seagrass species were detected and microalgal epiphyte assemblages on Halophila ovalis were identified as useful bioindicators of environmental gradients as this seagrass species is located at intertidal, shallow and deep water sites for a substantial part of the year. H. ovalis also recorded the highest average annual epiphyte loads (3873 &#177; 1882 cells/mm2) with the diatoms Diatoma vulgare and Cocconeis scutellum representing 19.6% and 17.2% of the total epiphyte cover. Highest cell density was recorded in autumn, followed by summer and winter: spring recorded the lowest epiphyte cover. Micro-algal epiphyte load was assessed as dry weight (g/m2), Chl a (&#181;g/L) and cell density (cells/mm2) on artificial seagrass deployed along a water quality gradient. Equations were derived to describe percentage light transmission as a function of each measure of epiphyte load which allows transformation of data from one unit of expression to another and hence, allow comparison of past, current and future studies. Water column light attenuation was evaluated along a water quality gradient and linked to Secchi depths (Zsd) to derive equations that describe this relationship where for Hervey Bay, when Zsd &lt; 4.26m, Kz = -1.2 ln Zsd + 1.74 and when Zsd &#8805; 4.26m, Kz=1.37/Zsd. Species succession, diversity and seagrass growth were monitored for the first time during a recovery phase and limits for the seagrass compensation depth (Zc), were established on a seasonal basis for five seagrass species at four locations within intertidal, shallow and deep water zones in Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Straits. Conceptual models for each site were constructed to describe habitat characteristics and include nutrient concentrations for SRP, NOx and ammonia (NH4+), Chl a, phytoplankton density, epiphyte density and light requirements measured as light attenuation, total suspended sediment, turbidity and Secchi depth at each location. The study provides a descriptive model for light attenuation and establishes (1) an annual and seasonal baseline water quality data set that characterises the waterways of Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Straits (2) identification of phytoplankton species in Hervey Bay and their response to post flood changes in water quality (3) phytoplankton density and diversity along an environmental gradient with links established to Chl a, Secchi depth, SRP and pH (4) seagrass epiphyte assemblage structure along an environmental gradient with links established to NOx and temperature (5) conversion factors for epiphyte load expressed as dry weight, Chl a and cell density (6) functions to convert Secchi depth to light attenuation coeffiecients (Kz) (7) seagrass species succession at intertidal, shallow and deep water sites during a recovery growth phase in Hervey Bay (8) seagrass compensation depths (Zc) for five seagrass species at four locations and (9) habitat characterisation for seagrass recovery in Hervey Bay. Identification catalogues for phytoplankton and seagrass epiphytes were prepared with light and electron micrographs to assist future identification studies of diatoms in this region and for other similar biogeographical areas. The management of water quality to reach specific targets requires the capacity to predict seagrass compensation depth (Zc) as a function of water quality. Seasonal and annual light attenuation measurements are derived as a function of water quality at intertidal, shallow and deep water habitats during the colonisation of Zostera Capricornii, Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, Halophila spinulosa and Halophila decipiens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Light attenuation, nutrient limitation, eutrophication, water quality, phytoplankton, seagrass epiphytes, diatoms, colonisation, bioindicators, seagrass compensation depth.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the Kondinin Group phenomenon: research into a successful self-help farmer organisation</field><field name="creator">Mark Casey</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This thesis studies the background of the largest single farmer organisation in Australia and its role in influencing practice change. The study seeks to address a number of questions starting with: how did a small Western Australian farmer group reach national prominence over a relatively short period and become a major influence on agriculture in Australia? This research uses quantitative and qualitative methods and is informed by a constructionist philosophy. The research process involved five phases. Phase one consisted of examining the possibilities of the research and its value. It also addressed the research problem and questions. Phase two involved a survey of Kondinin Group members and negotiating with the Kondinin Group for access to its database. The survey was faxed to 1501 members in the northern region of Australia and the data from 272 responses was entered and reported. From this, the researcher could validate that the study had merit and the Kondinin Group was making a substantial difference to its members. Phase three revolved around a literature review to see what information was available on the Kondinin Group and other farm organisations. The study also examined how the group related to management and organizational theory, social trends and the body of work on extension and farmer capacity building. Phase four sought to further examine the organisation through interviews with key informants including people from the Kondinin Group and other farm organisations. Phase five of the research involved bringing information and data together to more comprehensively address the research questions and draw conclusions from the study.

It is clear that Moyse&#8217;s own experience in opera orchestras and exposure to opera repertoire and singers influenced his teaching style and publications. In addition to De la sonorit&#233;, he published two volumes of opera arias transcribed for the flute (in 1962 and 1973) which suggest that bel canto, the opera and the flute were all related in his mind. Indeed, it is possible to significantly enhance our understanding of De la sonorit&#233; if it is viewed from the perspective of its vocal influences. Historical references advocate the use of the voice as a model for expression because it is the vehicle through which emotions are expressed. As a result Moyse extolled this &#8220;natural way&#8221; in his teachings. Exploring bel canto establishes similarities to flute playing both aesthetically and technically. The exercises contained in De la sonorit&#233; enable the player to work towards producing a homogeneous and focused sound with ease through the entire register of the instrument at any dynamic level. Alongside a discussion of the five sections that make up De la sonorit&#233; (&#8220;Timbre and Homogeneity of Tone in the Three Registers,&#8221; &#8220;Suppleness in the Low Register,&#8221; &#8220;Attack and Slurring of Notes,&#8221; &#8220;Fullness of Tone&#8221; and &#8220;The Management of Tone in Interpretation&#8221;) the present study includes a practical performance-based perspective with commentary on Moyse&#8217;s approach from three leading flute players and pedagogues currently working in Australia: James Kortum, Lecturer in Flute at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music; Alan Hardy, Lecturer in Flute at The University of Melbourne; and Prudence Davis, Principal Flute with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Marcel Moyse, French Flute School, Opera, Bel Canto, Flute methods</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Pluralistic Analysis of Housing Renovation Choices in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Ti Ching Peng</field><field name="description">Housing renovation is a major activity for many consumers in Australia, and its growing popularity in recent years has been reflected not only by it share in GDP but also by publicity it receives via home exhibitions and numerous TV renovation shows. Despite this, and despite similar experiences in other countries, research on how decisions in this sector are made is still quite sparse, a major restraint being the limitation of secondary data. This thesis attempts to improve knowledge in this area while at the same time exploring the feasibility and benefits of doing applied economic research in a pluralistic manner. From the perspective of mainstream economics, individuals&#8217; decision-making in the context of renovation can be modelled in terms of utility/profit maximization subject to a budget constraint. The literature that has attempted to follow this research strategy is reviewed in Chapter 2, as is research undertaken in sociology that has been partly informed by behavioural economics. The economic literature fails to recognize the possible importance of social influence and psychological factors in this context. This could be unfortunate, as these factors, which are seen as important in some other economic paradigms, may explain how some renovators get derailed from rational decision-making. The methodology of pluralism offers a way to bridge between these divergent arguments by keeping mainstream insights in mind whilst at the same time adopting an &#8216;open-minded&#8217; rather than &#8216;autistic&#8217; attitudes towards different paradigms and embracing &#8216;realistic&#8217; aspects (e.g. limits to individuals&#8217; rational behaviours) rather than assuming them away. Chapter 3 examines the case for pluralism and shows that although debate in economics is often couched in terms of a battle between fundamentally opposed &#8216;mainstream&#8217; and &#8216;heterodox&#8217; views, a deeper analysis of sub-paradigms reveals a complex web of partially overlapping core ideas. Once this richer view of schools of thought in economics is recognized, orthodox economics and heterodox economics are not necessarily incompatible but rather seem potentially complementary. Despite renovation being a popular topic in Australia, relevant micro-data regarding individuals&#8217; choices and their social and psychological attitudes towards renovation are in short supply. Therefore, unlike most previous renovation studies using published secondary data, this study involved the collection of primary data by a survey mailed to a sample of Brisbane residents in late 2006 and early 2007. Chapter 4 explains this choice of method, which provided data on respondents&#8217; decision-making regarding renovation, their demographics, and social and psychological factors. This data set was used to analyse the following four topics: individuals&#8217; decision to renovate or not (Chapter 5); renovators&#8217; choice between using their own labour (DIY) or outsourcing the work (Chapter 6); psychographic segments of &#8216;non-renovators&#8217;, &#8216;DIY-renovators&#8217; and &#8216;Hire-renovators&#8217; (renovators who outsource the work) (Chapter 7); and factors shaping renovators&#8217; tendencies to engage in overcapitalization and cost escalation in their renovation projects (Chapter 8). The pluralistic philosophy is applied in an addition way to analyse these issues, since the study used a variety of statistical techniques. The empirical results reveal that this dual form of pluralism&#8212;involving theoretical inputs from a variety of paradigms (including both &#8216;old&#8217; and &#8216;new&#8217; behavioural economics, socio-economics and others) and a variety of analytical techniques (cluster analysis, logistic regression and others)&#8212;does indeed widen our understanding of this topic. Generally speaking, the empirical finding stresses the importance of psychological factors in the context of individuals&#8217; decision-making on renovation. In analysing individuals&#8217; decisions to renovate or not, it is shown that, besides conventional factors (such as age of respondents), the psychological factor &#8216;perceived self-performance in renovation&#8217; is crucial: individuals are more likely to embrace renovation if they perceive highly their ability to handle the renovation process. In exploring renovators&#8217; decisions to engage in do-it-yourself (DIY) or hire others to do the work in their latest renovation projects, besides factors such as the scope of the project and renovators&#8217; capabilities, the psychological factor &#8216;trust in contractors&#8217; plays an important role: renovators are more likely to choose to use their own labour if they are uncertain about contractors&#8217; reliability while those who outsource renovation works are in general more trusting than those who engage in DIY. The exploratory psychographic analysis of heterogeneous groups within each of the three groups (non-renovators, DIY-renovators and Hire-renovators) indicates the necessity of recognizing the heterogeneity the population when designing policies to improve the efficiency of the renovation market. In the investigation of renovators&#8217; mistakes that lead to overcapitalization and cost escalation, psychological factors did not show their expected strong influences on either of these phenomena. However, it was found that the factors related to the project itself, especially the scope of the project (approximated by &#8216;time spent on preparation&#8217;) and the age of house, influence renovators&#8217; overcapitalized spending and the extent of their cost escalation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Renovation</field><field name="subject">Decision-makings</field><field name="subject">Pluralism</field><field name="subject">Behavioural economics</field><field name="subject">Economic psychology</field><field name="subject">Do-it-yourself</field><field name="subject">Overcapitalization</field><field name="subject">Cost escalation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A FEMINIST ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING SOCIAL STRUCTURES ON THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND PRACTICES OF WOMEN LIVING IN IRELAND AND IRISH FEMALE EMIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Bridget Broadbent</field><field name="description">Abstract The present study analyses the role of women in the Roman Catholic Church and the main question addressed is: &#8220;How do women construct and maintain an adult Catholic identity in the light of social, political, economic and religious changes?&#8221; In order to answer this question I began with grounded theory which enabled me to locate my research in the everyday lives of the study participants. In the course of the research I made a methodological shift to an institutional ethnographic approach in order to better understand the women&#8217;s lives as Catholics. One of the major tenets of an institutional ethnographic approach is that in modern bureaucratic organisations the authority and instructions of institutions and organisations are carried via the texts they produce. These texts can be written texts or they can be videos, film, etc. Because they carry the authority of the institution or organisation texts have the power to shape people&#8217;s lives and co-ordinate their everyday activities with multiple others, without, however, wholly determining them. In common with other major organisations the Roman Catholic Church is a large, worldwide organisation which relies on the texts it produces to carry its instructions and authority into the homes, churches and personal lives of its members. The greatest production of written texts by the Catholic Church in the modern era took place at the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). While many feminist scholars have dismissed the Council proceedings as saying very little about women in particular, I argue that the Councillors&#8217; writings in several major texts have strongly and specifically impacted the lives of contemporary Catholic women. Consequently, while all the texts produced by the bishops at the council can be considered of interest to practising Catholics generally, in this study I have chosen to focus on texts that related to issues that have proved to be of particular interest to the participants of this research study: the role of the laity in the church, Mariology and marriage. In order to carry out the research involved in this study I interviewed thirty women in Australia and thirty women in Ireland between the ages of 55 and 19 years of age. The Australian women immigrated to Australia during the years 1970 and 1997. All of the participants had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church as babies and they all underwent a similar socialisation process growing up in Ireland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Australian, Catholic, Irish, identity, power, Vatican II, ruling relations, laity, Marianism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187061</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the anti-carcinogenic potential of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a nuclear factor kappa B inhibitor, on renal cell carcinoma</field><field name="creator">Christudas Morais</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the most common type of kidney cancer, is a highly metastatic disease. Late stage metastatic RCC is essentially incurable and lethal. The average survival of patients, following metastatic RCC, is about 4 months and only 10% of patients survive for one year. None of the currently available chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal or biological therapies have a significant impact on the progression of the disease. Novel chemotherapeutics are urgently required for the treatment of this deadly disease. The mechanisms that pose the greatest challenges to chemotherapeutics are resistance of tumour cells to apoptosis, tumour angiogenesis and multi-drug resistance. Resistance to apoptosis may be mediated by the up-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, especially Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and/or by the down- regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, particularly Bax. Angiogenesis is pivotal for tumour growth and metastasis. Of all identified pro-angiogenic molecules, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is considered to be a key molecule. Drug resistance is thought to be mediated by the up-regulation of multi-drug resistance molecules such as MDR-1 and MRP-1. Up-regulation of Bcl-2 also confers drug resistance to cancer cells. The main hypothesis of this thesis was that treatment targets of metastatic RCCs are likely to multifactorial and that inhibition of molecules that regulate the processes of apoptosis, angiogenesis and multidrug resistance are likely to be better targets than those that regulate only one of these processes. In this regard, the transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) meets the criterion, regulating the apoptotic, angiogenic and multi-drug resistance pathways of cancer cells. Its inhibition appeared to be an attractive strategy for the treatment of metastatic RCC. Many studies have demonstrated an association between the over-expression NF-kB and RCC. Thus, the major aim of this thesis was to explore the anti-cancer effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a potent NF-kB inhibitor on human metastatic RCC cell lines. The thesis is divided into seven Chapters. In Chapter 1, the literature on RCC, NF-&#61547;B and the role of NF-kB in RCC development and progression are reviewed. The rationale for the inhibition of NF-kB as a potential anti-RCC strategy using PDTC is established. During the course of this research, the use of PDTC as an anti-cancer agent has risen to prominence. Chapter 2 describes the materials and methods used in the project. In Chapter 3, the expression of NF-kB in human kidney and the RCC cell lines, ACHN and SN12K1, was established. The proof of hypothesis that NF-kB inhibition using PDTC is an effective anti-cancer strategy was demonstrated. PDTC was selectively toxic to the RCC cell lines, but not to normal human kidney cells. PDTC induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of the RCC cells. PDTC also inhibited NF-kB, its upstream regulatory molecules such as the inhibitory protein family of the IkBs, and the kinase IKK complex. PDTC also inhibited anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but not pro-apoptotic Bax. Chapter 4 demonstrated the in vitro and ex vivo anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic effects of PDTC. Protein microarrays for angiogenic factors produced controversial results. PDTC inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF) produced in endothelial cells. VEGF had neutral effect on angiogenesis under the experimental conditions used. In the RCC cell lines, several pro-angiogenic molecules were modulated. Interestingly, the pro-angiogenic molecule interleukin (IL)-8 was up-regulated in both RCC cell lines. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was decreased in ACHN cells, but increased in SN12K1 cells. The implications of these controversial findings are discussed. Chapter 5 demonstrated the ability of PDTC to overcome drug resistance in a synergism with cisplatin. Individual non-toxic concentrations of PDTC and cisplatin, when combined, induced significant toxicity of RCC cell lines. The synergistic effect was not mediated by the inhibition of NF-kB, but rather through the inhibition of transcriptional activation of NF-kB. Bcl-2 rather than MDR-1 or the regulatory protein MRP-1 may be important in overcoming drug resistance in RCC. Chapter 6 showed the anti-cancer effect of PDTC in an animal model of RCC. PDTC significantly decreased the growth of RCC implanted in the kidney of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. PDTC inhibited NF-kB and was not toxic to normal cells. The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bax were contradictory to the in vitro findings and a theory about the spread of RCC based on these findings is discussed. In Chapter 7, the findings are summarised. A case for PDTC as a potential therapeutic agent for RCC is established. Under the experimental conditions used, PDTC was demonstrated to be an effective anti-RCC agent by targeting the three most important characteristics of RCC that pose the greatest challenges to chemotherapeutics: resistance of tumour cells to apoptosis, tumour angiogenesis and multi-drug resistance. PDTC was selectively toxic to RCC, but not to normal renal cells. Thus PDTC appears to be a promising anti-cancer agent. This is supported by the current increase in interest, and in the number of publications, on the use of PDTC in several cancers. Some future directions are also discussed in this Chapter. These include, but are not limited to, an investigation of what is protecting normal cells from the toxicity of PDTC, the creation of an Australian database on RCC, and the characterisation of RCC based on NF-kB expression.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">drug resistance</field><field name="subject">Nuclear Factor-kappa B</field><field name="subject">Metastasis</field><field name="subject">Renal Cell Carcinoma</field><field name="subject">Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate</field><field name="subject">Proliferation</field><field name="subject">Scid Mice</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Life Cycle Assessment of Wastewater Treatment Systems</field><field name="creator">Jeffrey Foley</field><field name="description">Over recent decades, environmental regulations on wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) have trended towards increasingly stringent nutrient removal requirements for the protection of local waterways. However, such regulations ignore the other environmental impacts that might accompany the apparent improvements to the WWTP. This PhD thesis used Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify these environmental trade-offs, and so better inform policy makers on the wider benefits and burdens associated with wastewater treatment. A particular focus was also given to the generation of methane and nitrous oxide in wastewater systems, since the quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from WWTPs is presently a substantial area of uncertainty. Rapid changes to the GHG regulatory landscape mean that this level of uncertainty, now represents an unacceptable business risk for many water utilities. Specifically, there were three research objectives of this thesis: Research Objective No.1 &#8211; Environmental optimisation of wastewater treatment systems &#8211; For typical receiving environments, the optimum wastewater treatment system configuration is not necessarily at the limit of best practice for nutrient removal. The LCA approach to this research objective was divided into two stages. In stage I, a comprehensive desk-top life cycle inventory of ten different wastewater treatment scenarios was completed. The scenarios covered six process configurations and treatment standards ranging from raw sewage to advanced nutrient removal. It was shown that physical infrastructure, chemical usage and operational energy all increased with the level of nutrient removal. These trends represented a trade-off of negative environmental impacts against improved local receiving water quality. In stage II of the LCA, a quantitative life cycle impact assessment of the ten scenarios, referenced against Australian normalisation data, was completed. From a normalised perspective against Australian society, the contribution of WWTPs to headline issues such as global warming and energy consumption was found to be very small. The more prominent environmental impact categories were eutrophication due to nutrient discharge and toxicity issues, due to heavy metals in biosolids. There existed a broader environmental trade-off for nutrient removal, that could only be justified by society and regulators implicitly placing higher value on local water quality, than on other global environmental pressures. In light of this quantitative LCA, regulatory agencies should consider the broader environmental consequences of their policies such as the Queensland Water Quality Guidelines. It is suggested that the scope of WWTP licensing considerations should be widened from a singular focus on water quality objectives, to a more comprehensive LCA-based approach. Research Objective No. 2 &#8211; Quantification of nitrous oxide emissions from biological nutrient removal (BNR) wastewater treatment plants &#8211; Current GHG assessment methods for wastewater treatment plants are grossly inaccurate because of significant unaccounted N2O emissions. The research for objectives two and three was funded by the Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA), which is the peak body of the Australian urban water industry. Thus, whilst the earlier LCA results suggested that GHG emissions from WWTPs were insignificant from a national perspective, the industry is actually very engaged on this issue from an environmental responsibility and business risk perspective. This PhD study adopted a rigorous mass balance approach to determine N2O-N generation at seven full-scale WWTPs. The results varied considerably in the range 0.006 &#8211; 0.253 kgN2O-N generated per kgNdenitrified (average: 0.035 +/- 0.027). These results were generally larger than the current default value assumed in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Technical Guidelines (i.e. 0.01 kg N2O-N.kgN-1denitrified). High N2O-N generation was shown to correspond with elevated bulk NO2--N concentrations in the bioreactor. The results also suggested that WWTPs designed for low effluent TN have lower and less variable N2O generation than plants that only achieve partial denitrification. Research Objective No.3 &#8211; Quantification of methane emissions from low-strength wastewater collection systems &#8211; Current default GHG assessment methods for sewerage systems are grossly inaccurate because of significant unaccounted CH4 emissions from rising mains. Presently, international GHG guidelines state that &#8220;wastewater in closed underground sewers is not believed to be a significant source of methane&#8221; (IPCC, 2006). However, the results of this PhD research demonstrated that methane generation in rising main sewers is substantial. It was shown that dissolved methane concentrations were dependent upon pipeline geometry and sewage residence time. Consequently, it was possible to develop a simple, yet robust, theoretical model that predicted methane generation from these two independent parameters. This model provides a practical means for water authorities globally to make an estimate of the currently unaccounted methane emissions from pressurised sewerage systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Life Cycle Assessment.</field><field name="subject">Normalisation</field><field name="subject">wastewater</field><field name="subject">Biological Nutrient Removal</field><field name="subject">Anaerobic</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse Gas</field><field name="subject">Methane</field><field name="subject">Nitrous Oxide</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Field River as a refuge for small vertebrates in the Simpson Desert</field><field name="creator">Carissa Free</field><field name="description">More than two-thirds of Australia is classified as arid or semi arid and receives less than 500 mm of rain annually. Throughout these arid areas, rivers and drainage lines (which often have their catchments in higher rainfall areas) act as arteries for vast amounts of water to flow into these dry landscapes. Many inland rivers, including the Paroo, Bulloo and Cooper Creeks, have highly variable flow rates and can go many years with very little or no flow. As a result of the hydrology of these areas, they contain different soil characteristics and vegetation communities from the surrounding arid landscapes. For example, soil nutrients are thought to be higher along drainage lines and on floodplains due to sediment deposition and decomposition of organic material. Also, vegetation in these areas needs to not only survive drought conditions (as a plant or propogule), but also periodic inundation and flood events. These characteristics are thought to make these areas more productive than the surrounding arid lanscapes and are thought to be important habitats for flora and fauna. There has been much debate over the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrate species. Several studies internationally in mesic areas have suggested that riparian corridors contain higher levels of biodiversity than the surrounding habitats, although this pattern is not replicated in all areas or for all taxonomic groups. Many of these studies suggest that the difference in biodiversity between riparian areas and adjacent habitats should be greater in xeric areas where the habitat differences between these areas are greatest. Other studies have suggested that diversity is not necessarily greater but riparian areas are important habitats for different species and may act as a refuge for some species. In Australia, very few studies have been conducted on the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrates in arid areas, despite these habitats being under threat from grazing, flow alteration and flow diversion. In this study I examined the role of the Field River in the Simpson Desert as a potential refuge for vertebrate species and compared diversity and population dynamics of vertebrates at dune and riverine sites. Specifically this study aimed to: 1) determine if species richness of vertebrates along the Field River was greater in riverine ecosystems than the surrounding dune habitats; 2) quantify how the riverine habitats differed in terms of floristics, vegetation complexity, soils and water availability from the surrounding landscapes; 3) determine the dynamics of terrestrial vertebrate populations along the Field River; and 4) determine if the abundance, diversity and demographics of small vertebrate populations along the Field River was different from populations in the sand dune fields on a broader landscape scale. These questions were examined on Ethabuka Station in the Simpson Desert, Queensland, from 2006 to 2008. The riparian corridor along the Field River was found to have a range of characteristics that make it unique from the surrounding dune habitats. Soils along the riverine corridor were found to be characterised by more than 20% clay while soils on the dune crest were characterised by no more than 5% clay. Further, soil carbon and nitrogen was significantly higher in the riverine corridor than in the dune habitats and decreased with distance from the catchment. Spinifex (Triodia basedowii) cover was low in the corridor but dominated the dune swale. Number of trees and cover by trees and non-spinifex grasses were also significantly higher in the riverine corridor when compared to the surrounding dunes. Following the rainfall, annual cover was also significantly greater and they persisted much longer than in the dunes. There was very little difference in the diversity or number of invertebrates between the different habitat types. Species richness was estimated to be highest (48 species) in the riverine centre and lowest in the floodplain (30 species). The riverine habitats had different species pools when compared to the dune habitats. Several species including Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella exclusively inhabited the riverine habitats while others such as the skinks Ctenotus ariadnae and Ctenotus dux were captured only in the dune habitats. Results from a Canonical Correspondence Analysis suggest that the distribution of some species in arid areas, such as the introduced House Mouse (Mus musculus), may be correlated with habitat characteristics associated with the riverine corridor, e.g. soil moisture or high annual cover. Abundance, body condition and reproduction of mammals along the Field River was generally driven by time. On a local scale, habitat had little effect on the abundance of the Sandy Inland Mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis) and Lesser Hairy-footed Dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni), although M. musculus showed some preference for the riverine corridor. Abundance and reproduction of both rodent species increased following rainfall while S. youngsoni abundance was strongly seasonal with increases in abundance in autumn and winter. More than 45% of all captures were reptiles and this group was the most diverse and conspicuous fauna group along the riverine corridor. Abundance of the two most common lizard species, the Military Dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis) and Central-netted Dragons (Ctenophorus nuchalis), was significantly affected by time, with the abundance of both species decreasing dramatically 12 months after rainfall, possibly due to increased predation. Abundance of the Beaked Gecko, Rhynchoedura ornata, began to decrease prior to rainfall, suggesting a factor other than habitat structure or food availability causing the decline. The skink, Lerista labialis, showed strong seasonal trends in abundance and body condition, which suggested that within the desert riverine corridor the species was not reliant on rain-induced changes in food availability. To compare the effect of habitat on species richness, composition and population dynamics at a regional scale, sites along the riparian corridor were compared with dune sites located 500 m to 45 km from the Field River. On this scale, species species richness varied spatially with only one of the riverine sites having higher estimated species richness than the dune sites. Species turnover was greater in riverine sites despite the habitat data suggesting that primary production in these sites was more stable. Some species were able to persist at riverine sites at all times of the year but were only present in the community at dune sites following rainfall, suggesting that the riverine sites may be a more stable habitat for some species. Composition analysis revealed that dune and riverine habitats contain different communities, and some species, particularly Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella, probably rely on the river for their habitat requirements. Population dynamics including abundance, reproduction and body condition of seven species were compared between dune and riverine habitats. Only four, M. musculus, L. labialis, C. nuchalis and S. youngsoni, showed any significant affect of habitat on abundance. Abundance of C. nuchalis, S. youngsoni and L. labialis were generally more abundant in the dune habitats although the affect was only significant for some sampling sessions. The only species that was significantly more abundant in the riverine habitats than dune habitats was the introduced M. musculus. This species appears to be reliant on the riverine corridor, only appearing commonly in the dune habitats following rainfall. For most species, the number of juveniles captured increased following the rainfall in January 2007 but only in C. nuchalis and P. hermannsburgensis was there any significant difference between habitat types. For both species, generally more juveniles were captured in the dune habitats than in the riverine habitats. This study provided information on the role of the Field River to vertebrate fauna on Ethabuka Station. Although, the study focused only on one ephemeral desert river, it could be considered representative of similar desert rivers such as the Hay, Plenty and Hale rivers further west in central Australia. The riverine corridor did represent a different habitat to the surrounding sand dunes, and some characteristics, such as greater soil moisture, soil nutrients and annual cover, suggest that it may have greater and more stable primary production. Although the species studied did not generally have greater abundance and body condition, or reproduce more in the riverine corridor, many species including the Long-nosed Dragon (Amphibolurus longirostris), Desert Tree Frog (Litoria rubella) and Pygmy Mulga Monitor (Varanus gilleni) are likely to rely on the habitat that the riverine corridor provides. With expanding human populations placing greater pressure on rivers around the world, particularly in arid areas, it is imperative that we understand the ecology of these riparian systems so that effective management and conservation strategies can be developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">dynamics</field><field name="subject">fauna</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="subject">Simpson Desert</field><field name="subject">Field River</field><field name="subject">vertebrates</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">rivers</field><field name="subject">desert</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV prevention trials among women who engage in transactional sex in Africa: Towards a broader understanding of feasibility</field><field name="creator">Andrew Vallely</field><field name="description">The choice of suitable study populations in which to conduct large-scale phase III HIV prevention trials is a fundamental issue for communities, researchers, sponsors and donor organizations. In many developed and developing countries, such trials are feasible only among vulnerable, disadvantaged communities at high-risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, where high HIV incidence rates make randomised controlled efficacy trials feasible but where poverty, social exclusion, illiteracy, stigma and powerlessness mean ethical considerations are paramount. In such settings, preliminary feasibility studies are considered essential to inform the design of future phase III efficacy and safety trials. Researchers typically frame their assessment of feasibility within an &#8216;epidemiological paradigm&#8217;, focusing on a limited number of key biomedical outcome parameters to guide decision making. These include HIV, STI and pregnancy incidence; and the feasibility of recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of subjects from a given study population. This Thesis argues that a more comprehensive assessment of feasibility, which combines epidemiological factors with other key constructs such as ethics and social justice, is critical to the successful conduct of high quality and ethically sound HIV prevention trials among vulnerable at-risk study populations in Africa. This work is based on a combination of epidemiological, applied social science and participatory action-orientated research conducted during a microbicide trial feasibility study and an on-going phase III randomised placebo-controlled efficacy and safety trial of the candidate vaginal microbicide PRO2000/5 Gel (Indevus Pharmaceuticals, USA) that I coordinated as the Clinical Site Principal Investigator in Tanzania from November 2002 until March 2007, and for which I remain a Co-Investigator. All fieldwork was carried out in Mwanza City, in the Lake Victoria basin region of northwest Tanzania, among an occupational cohort of women working in bars, guesthouses, hotels and other food outlets and recreational facilities. Some women in this occupational group are known to periodically engage in transactional and commercial sex to supplement their income and are therefore considered to be at increased risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, and to represent a potential study population for future microbicide and other HIV prevention trials.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vaginal microbicides</field><field name="subject">feasibility study</field><field name="subject">clinical trial</field><field name="subject">community liaison</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">Africa</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward a Conceptual Framework for a more Sustainable Water Ethic: Identifying the Ethical Underpinnings of Water Management</field><field name="creator">Justine Lacey</field><field name="description">Water management has been described as one of the major natural resource management challenges facing our rural industries, regional communities, our unique natural environments and indeed, even our survival. Within this context, water ethics has emerged as a research area of some significance. However to date, a majority of the research has clustered around economic and environmental concerns. For the most part, explorations into the ethical management of water have been limited to a deliberative focus on the establishment of property rights and effective water pricing and trading mechanisms. These narrow economic approaches fail to recognise the diversity and plurality of our water values or to adequately address broader social values such as equity and justice. This research aims to address these imbalances by focusing on how we might develop a deeper understanding of ethical practice in the context of more sustainable water management. It achieves this by outlining an alternative ethical framework which will support these more sustainable social and policy outcomes. Thus, the rationale for this thesis is to demonstrate that contractual ethics, or even more specifically Scanlonian contractualism, is a viable alternative normative ethical framework to utilitarianism for considering how we might justify these more sustainable water management outcomes. There is significant debate and conflict over how water should best be managed. These debates capture not only the nature of the way we interact with the environment but also the way we interact with each other. It is in these two sets of interactions that ethics can provide us with a way of justifying our actions and decisions and a basis for determining what we consider to be right or wrong, or acceptable or unacceptable in terms of water management practice. An important element of this thesis is recognising that how we think about water has important implications for how we manage water and to date, this has been undervalued in water management. To that end, I argue we must necessarily begin to appreciate the connection between what is happening in our conceptual and theoretical landscapes and how this impacts on our physical landscapes. It is in these interactions and connections that we begin to appreciate both the depth of complexity and the &#8216;wicked&#8217; nature of water management. Thus, each of these debates and their related concerns exists within the broader context of how we think water should be managed and the processes by which we come to make and justify our decisions about water management. This thesis is therefore aimed at addressing this gap in the research around ethical water management. It achieves this by providing the basis for a framework which can capture not only the philosophical and ethical underpinnings of a more sustainable water ethic but also recognise and accommodate the significant research already undertaken in a variety of other disciplines. As a result, this thesis is necessarily interdisciplinary in its approach. While I base my arguments in the field of philosophical and ethical inquiry, the construction of a conceptual framework for a more sustainable water ethic is applicable to and widely influenced by a number of other fields including geography, anthropology, scientific research, economic theory, public policy and social theory. In recognising and preserving the interdisciplinary knowledge base around water management, part of the challenge has been to construct a conceptual framework and define ethical principles that can both honour this interdisciplinarity but also remain relevant in cross disciplinary settings. The nature of this interdisciplinary approach reinforces the inherent complexity of water management and was cause for some reflection because it raised the question of how best to address the research problem. This process of reflection had direct implications on the research process adopted in this thesis because it required not only an interdisciplinary response but also a balanced approach to preserving the complexity and the &#8216;wickedness&#8217; of water management. These elements needed to be preserved in the research process because they are integral to our understanding of water management and inevitably raise the difficult and particularly &#8216;human&#8217; questions we associate with it. Thus, the research process adopted in this thesis can be best understood as a process of reflective equilibrium. Reflective equilibrium describes the process by which we systematically examine our judgements and beliefs about a certain issue, searching for coherence with other beliefs and then revising those beliefs where evidence suggests they need to be modified. This approach allows for a range of diverse disciplinary considerations and interests to be considered in a holistic manner and is reflected in the following research activities. In the course of this thesis, I outline the development and construction of a conceptual framework for a more sustainable water ethic, which is based on a diverse range of disciplinary knowledge and expertise. This framework is supported by a rigorous and systematic application of contractual ethical principles. The first part of the thesis reflects a process of examination and review of relevant theoretical and methodological concerns, which enable interdisciplinary research to occur. In the second part of this thesis, a detailed analysis of contractual ethical principles and a philosophical analysis of values in the context of water management are presented. The findings elicited from these stages of the research are taken forward and used to examine two deliberately chosen but quite distinct case study analyses. These two case study examples reflect the diversity and range of political and policy concerns within the broader water management debate.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">ethics</field><field name="subject">water management</field><field name="subject">contractualism</field><field name="subject">Scanlon</field><field name="subject">interdisciplinary research</field><field name="subject">natural resource management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seeing the unseen: an exploration of reluctance to care in lay carers of cancer patients</field><field name="creator">Letitia Burridge</field><field name="description">Background: People are living longer with chronic life-limiting illnesses such as cancer. Much is expected of lay cancer carers with the shift of complex non-acute care to the community and the pressures this can place on family relationships. The lay caregiving role does not appeal to all, yet willingness to care is often expected by others including health professionals. Carers who feel reluctant but committed to the role may experience adverse consequences. Reluctance to care is under-investigated, particularly in the cancer context, and its indicators may include a poor carer-patient relationship, perceived lack of choice and lifestyle disruption. Existing theories of caregiving do not adequately explain reluctance to care, and the concept remains under-developed. The assumptions underpinning this study are that: some cancer carers are reluctant to care, some carers may be reluctant toward specific aspects of the caregiving role or at different times during the cancer trajectory, and some reluctant carers will not want to reveal or discuss their unwillingness. Aim: The aim of the study was to gain a clearer understanding of lay carers&#8217; reluctance to care for patients with recurrent cancer. Methods: A mixed methods design was used. In Phase I, data provided by a consecutive sample of carers (N = 98) of cancer patients corresponding to the patients&#8217; final year were analysed to explore the context in which reluctance to care might exist or develop, and focusing on differences by spousal relationship and by gender in anxiety and depression, awareness of the stage of cancer, perceived social support, and perceived burden. In Phase II, a purposive sample of carers of patients with recurrent cancer (N = 16) were interviewed in-depth, using open-ended questions to generate qualitative data regarding their perceptions and experiences of caregiving and reluctance to care. Complementary data were obtained from a purposive sample of health professionals who interact with cancer carers (N = 13). The interview transcripts were analysed qualitatively to identify patterns and themes which would provide insights into the dimensions of reluctance to care. Results: In Phase I, spouses perceived greater family support but caregiving had a greater negative impact on their daily activities and social interaction. Non-spouses were more anxious than spouses, but reported greater social support, and less negative impact on their finances, daily schedule and health. Female carers were more anxious and depressed than males, who reported less burden and greater social support. Awareness of the stage of cancer was positively but weakly correlated with anxiety and depression. In Phase II, reluctance to care was experienced by both spouses and non-spouses and was not gender specific. Carers and health professionals held diverging perceptions and expectations of the lay caregiving role. Caregiving was an obligatory but invisible role and for some carers it led to exhaustion due to a lack of role boundaries. Carers were faced with forced choices. The lay caregiving role seemed to come as a non-negotiable package of expectations which gave carers the autonomy to accept their role rather than the choice to refuse it. Contextual factors which seem conducive to reluctance were overshadowed by carers&#8217; commitment to the role, which suggests that their preferences were a lower priority despite the personal cost. There was indirect evidence of reluctance in others: family members distanced themselves from the caregiving situation, and health professionals were distanced from carers by their patient-centredness. Conclusions: This study has identified three fundamental dimensions of reluctance to care: the invisibility of the caregiving role, its lack of boundaries and its forced choices. Caregiving is often a sacrificial rather than reciprocal role, but reluctance is seen as an abnormal rather than realistic response to abnormal role expectations. The findings were limited by the extent to which carers disclosed reluctance and the extent to which reluctant carers remained in the role. As a result, reluctance to care may have been underestimated. Measuring this latent and taboo topic is likely to remain a challenge as the concept of reluctance to care continues to evolve. This study has established the importance of ongoing work on a topic which cannot remain hidden as the need for lay cancer care continues to expand.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Lay carer</field><field name="subject">Reluctance to care</field><field name="subject">Well-being</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="subject">Qualitative</field><field name="subject">Quantitative</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cancers of the Oesophagus: Exploring the Roles of Smoking, Alcohol and Gastro-oesophageal Reflux</field><field name="creator">Nirmala Pandeya</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Background Oesophageal cancer has a high mortality; it is the 6th most common cause of death due to cancer worldwide. Of the common subtypes of oesophageal cancer, it is the adenocarcinomas that have been rising rapidly in incidence throughout the western world. The incidence of adenocarcinomas now exceeds the previously common squamous cell carcinoma. These recent changes in the incidence patterns of oesophageal cancer suggests that the environmental risk factors associated with these subtypes differ, and that changes in the prevalence of these exposures over time are the most likely explanation for the observed shifts in the incidence. However, due to its low incidence until a few decades ago, the adenocarcinoma subtype has been less studied compared to squamous cell carcinoma, and the environmental factors associated with this cancer have not been so clearly defined. Smoking and alcohol have been the strongest environmental risk factors reported for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) whereas for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), the effect of smoking appears to be weaker, and the evidence for an effect of alcohol is scant and inconsistent. However, epidemiologic studies consistently identify people with frequent symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) as having the highest risk of OAC, but the effect of GOR on OSCC has been negligible. Furthermore, it has been argued that adenocarcinoma occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJAC) may have different aetiology again. Together, these reports suggest the three subtypes of oesophageal cancers (OAC, GOJAC and OSCC) may arise through different mechanisms with different strengths in the impact of risk factors. This thesis investigated the independent associations of smoking, alcohol and gastro-oesophageal reflux on cancers of the oesophagus by considering the possibility of variation in the risks due to differences in the dose effect patterns of various measures such as smoking, alcohol and GOR. Method Data from a population-based case-control study of oesophageal and ovarian cancers in Australia were used. Study participants comprised histologically confirmed cases of OSCC (n=308), OAC (n=367) and GOJAC (n=426) who were frequency matched to 1580 controls from the general population. Exposure history for both cases and controls were derived from health and lifestyle questionnaires. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the risk factors analysed. In addition, generalised additive model with a logit link was also used to explore and present the non-linearity in the dose effect pattern for continuous exposures adjusting for other confounding factors. The effects of two exposures combined on these cancers were assessed by obtaining synergy index. Results Smokers were at significantly higher risk of all three subtypes of oesophageal cancer with the risk greatest for OSCC. The effect of smoking was greater for adenocarcinoma occurring at the gastro-oesophageal junction compared to that of the oesophagus. Of the various measures of smoking, duration was significantly associated with all three subtypes of cancer whereas intensity was associated with only OSCC and GOJAC and the dose effect was non-linear. Time since quitting was associated with a steady decline in risk of all three cancers emphasising the health benefits of quitting among smokers. Alcohol was not associated with OAC or GOJAC but was significantly associated with OSCC among those drinking in excess of 170g/week. The association between alcohol and OSCC was modified by smoking; the association with alcohol was significantly greater among current smokers with effect. Low to moderate wine consumption was associated with significant risk reduction for all three cancers compared to non-drinkers. Increased frequency of GOR symptoms was associated with increased risks of OAC and GOJAC, although the risk of OSCC was constrained to frequent GOR symptoms only. The effect of GOR symptoms were exacerbated by smoking whereas it was weakened by regular NSAID use. Lastly, the sensitivity analysis that assessed the effect of non-participation among controls in the estimated effect of smoking and BMI (the two risk factors most likely to be affected by non-participation) showed a slight overestimation of effect of smoking assuming higher exposure rate among non-participants but not BMI while the effect remained strong and statistically significant. Conclusion Smoking, alcohol and GOR symptoms were the environmental factors strongly associated with all subtypes of oesophageal cancers. However, the dose effect patterns of these exposures varied by cancer subtypes. Smoking and alcohol were the larger contributing factors for OSCC whereas smoking and GOR symptoms had greater impact on OAC and GOJAC. Low to moderate wine consumption and regular NSAID use reduced the risk of all three subtypes significantly. While selection bias may have led to mildly inflated risks for smoking, the effects persisted even when modelled under extreme scenarios of biased participation amongst controls, and there was no evidence that selection bias materially affected the other associations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oesophageal cancer, risk factors, smoking, alcohol, gastro-oesophageal reflux</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic rate, respiratory partitioning and the implications for dive duration in the bimodally respiring Arafura filesnake, Acrochordus arafurae</field><field name="creator">Kirstin Pratt</field><field name="description">Diving vertebrates are constrained by an aquatic existence because they carry a limited store of oxygen whilst submerged and must return to the surface to breathe. Therefore, oxygen stores must be used efficiently in order to maximise aerobic dive duration. The ability to use additional, non-pulmonary gas exchange to obtain oxygen from the water provides a mechanism to alleviate the use of body oxygen stores and extend dive duration. The partitioning of gas exchange between aerial and aquatic modes is predicted by the theory of optimal breathing. As the cost of obtaining oxygen by one mode increases, the reliance on this mode should decrease whilst the reliance on the alternate mode should increase. A number of environmental, physiological and ecological factors can affect metabolic rate and/or the partitioning of gas exchange between aerial and aquatic modes, with consequences for dive duration. The overall aim of this study was to examine the effects of temperature, specific dynamic action and predation on respiratory partitioning and diving behaviour in the Arafura filesnake, Acrochordus arafurae. Filesnakes provide an excellent model to address the aims of this study because they are fully-aquatic and respire bimodally, utilising both aerial and aquatic (cutaneous) gas exchange. Metabolic rate and diving behaviour are usually thermally dependent in diving ectotherms. Given this knowledge, we tested whether A. arafurae was capable of up-regulating cutaneous oxygen uptake to compensate for the temperature induced increases in metabolic rate. Metabolic rate had a Q10(20-32&#176;C) of 2.33, however cutaneous oxygen uptake was independent of temperature and all elevated metabolic demands were met by increasing aerial oxygen uptake. Consequently, maximum dive duration was reduced by 70%, from 77 min at 20&#176;C to 28 min at 32&#176;C. The temperature independence of cutaneous oxygen uptake suggests that blood PO2 remained stable across temperatures and the increased blood flow expected with an elevated metabolic rate did not enhance the capacity for oxygen uptake (diffusion limited rather than perfusion limited). Although cutaneous oxygen uptake was not regulated, its contribution to extending dive duration was significant. When the ability to respire aquatically was removed (severe hypoxia), dive duration was reduced by up to 30%. Acrochordus arafurae feeds infrequently on large, high-protein meals thus the postprandial metabolic response was significant. Meal size and fast length (13 days or one month) were both positively related to the peak metabolic scope. After fasting for one month, peak rate of oxygen consumption was up to 12-fold standard metabolic rate (SMR) with the largest meal size. By comparison, an animal that was fasted for 13 days and fed an equivalent meal size incurred a six-fold increase in SMR. The energetic costs of digestion (specific dynamic action, SDA) increased with meal size, but fast length had no effect, suggesting the up-regulation of gut function was not a significant cost in the SDA. Pulmonary and cutaneous gas exchange increased with elevated metabolic demands however pulmonary oxygen uptake was the dominant mode. Despite the increase in cutaneous oxygen uptake during digestion, maximum dive duration decreased by between 50% and 90% of fasted values. The significant reductions in dive duration following feeding may have implications for predator vulnerability. Diving animals are most vulnerable to predation at the water&#8217;s surface. The theory of optimal diving under predation predicts that animals should make shorter, more frequent surface intervals or longer, less frequent surfacing intervals to minimise exposure to predators. Acrochordus arafurae is prone to aerial (birds of prey) and aquatic (crocodiles, large fish) predation. Simulated avian predation did not change dive or surface duration or proportion of time at the surface or spent active. However, a greater number of longer dives were observed with fewer long surface intervals suggesting an increase in the use of cutaneous oxygen uptake. The nocturnal diving patterns of A. arafurae provide an in-built anti-predator strategy. The threat of aquatic predation by a large fish produced atypical anti-predator responses; A. arafurae became increasingly active, reduced dive duration and increased surface interval which was indicative of a foraging response. The field diving behaviour of adult A. arafurae was determined using acoustic telemetry and interpreted in the context of environmental and ecological conditions. The mean dive duration was 6.6 min, with 85% of dives less than 10 min in duration. The maximum dive duration was 153 min. There was no diel pattern in dive duration. Snakes were located at an mean depth of 0.62 m, however, they occasionally ventured to greater depths (up to 6 m) but very infrequently. Snake body temperature reflected water temperature and fluctuated by approximately 1&#176;C on a daily basis. The short and shallow dives of A. arafurae minimise travel costs associated with surfacing and may be an anti-predator strategy. Metabolic rate and respiratory partitioning is dependent on physiological and ecological factors with consequences for dive duration. Temperature and postprandial induced increases in metabolic demands were met by increasing the reliance on aerial gas exchange given the limitations of cutaneous gas exchange; and dive duration was substantially reduced as a result. Ecological factors, such as predation, can increase the cost of surfacing and promote the use of aquatic gas exchange. However, changes to behaviour, including habitat choice, residence depth and the employment of a diving strategy that does not maximise dive duration may be just as effective at minimising the costs and maximising the gains of a dive.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acrochordus</field><field name="subject">bimodal gas exchange</field><field name="subject">digestion</field><field name="subject">hypoxia</field><field name="subject">optimal diving</field><field name="subject">predation</field><field name="subject">rate of oxygen consumption</field><field name="subject">reptile</field><field name="subject">specific dynamic action</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Teachers' and Students Use of Self-Questioning Strategy in an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) Context in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Dyah Sunggingwati</field><field name="description">The teaching practices of English reading in Indonesia provide limited opportunities for students to engage actively with texts to foster comprehension. Teaching reading through the use of self-questioning strategy has been shown to be an effective approach to improve students&#8217; levels of questioning that promotes reading comprehension. However, for this to occur, teachers need a more effective self-questioning strategy to use it with their students. This study investigates the development of teachers&#8217; and students&#8217; self-questioning strategy use, the challenges faced by teachers, and the assistance that they need to implement it. The effects of the implementation of self-questioning strategy on students&#8217; skills in generating questions about English passages are also examined. This study was conducted in Samarinda, the capital of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, where English is a foreign language to Indonesian speakers. Three teachers and their Grade 11 classes from three different secondary schools participated in a multiple-site case study which was employed to generate rich explanatory data across sites. Data were gathered from both teachers and students in the form of observations, field-notes, interviews and reflective journals. Audio and video recordings of classes and teaching of English reading were used to support the data collection. The teachers were subsequently trained in a workshop in the use of self-questioning strategy with guidelines for the use of different levels of questions based on Bloom&#8217;s taxonomy. The teachers then implemented the self-questioning strategy with students in their classrooms. Two levels of analysis were applied in this multiple-site case study. Within site study analysis involved organising the data to search for patterns for each site. Across-site study analysis was then applied to generate themes, knowledge, concepts, and connections between variables and across the study sites before triangulation with other sources of data was undertaken to draw conclusions. The findings from this study show that teachers relied on textbooks for pedagogies for teaching reading and for the kinds of questions they asked to assist in reading comprehension. This meant that both teachers and students were exposed mainly to low level questions. Thus, they faced challenges in generating high level questions in these conditions, and required assistance in order to do this. The results reveal that both teachers and students perceived that they gained benefits from the application of the self-questioning strategy. Some factors that contributed to the effectiveness of the implementation of the self-questioning strategy in this EFL context were teachers&#8217; knowledge and confidence, the abilities of students, the nature of the class, the supportive learning environment, and sufficient time for implementation. The implications for future research included the need to examine the self-questioning strategy in a longitudinal study, and the need to focus on students&#8217; understanding and transfer of learning to other contexts. More generally, this study shows that the self-questioning strategy can be implemented effectively in reading lessons in Grade 11 classes in an Indonesian context. The findings of the study reveal that as well as improving teachers&#8217; and students&#8217; abilities to generate questions about English passages, the use of self-questioning also promotes the development of a more learner-centred approach in EFL and assists teachers to ask questions in their classrooms that go beyond those provided in the textbooks. The findings suggest that research in self-questioning strategy needs to be expanded and continued because this study has shown the potential of the strategy to enhance students&#8217; engagement in learning and potentially to foster improvements in reading comprehension.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Developing, self-questioning strategy, teachers, students, English as a Foreign Language (EFL), Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of probiotic Bacillus species on the composition and diversity of the midgut microbiota of black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon</field><field name="creator">Jessica Hill</field><field name="description">Microbial communities associated with gastrointestinal tract of animals play a critical role in gut development, digestion and resistance to disease, thus the prospect of altering these communities beneficially by using probiotics is attractive. In terrestrial animals, the gut provides a stable, moist habitat in an otherwise moisture-limited environment, thus microbial communities tend to be very stable. In contrast, farmed aquatic animals reside within an environment that can support microbes in high densities, and as many marine animals drink continuously for osmoregulation, they are subjected to potential re-inoculation. Consequently, little is known of the stability of gut microbial communities in marine shrimp or whether it is possible to establish beneficial bacteria in the gut. The aims of this thesis were therefore to examine the midgut microbial community associated with farmed black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, and to investigate whether the introduction of potentially probiotic Bacillus could alter the species diversity or abundance of the present microbes. Using culture methods it was found that B. pumilus was able to transfer between animals via the water column and persisted in the midgut for at least 7 days, while B. subtilis was only recovered from animals directly fed the bacteria and persisted for less than 24 h in the midgut. V. parahaemolyticus, a known shrimp pathogen,remained in the tanks it was originally found in, and did not transfer via the water column to other tanks and is therefore tightly associated with its host. A bacterium with apparent probiotic qualities was isolated from control animals in the above study and identified as a strain of B. pumilus. Its safety for food animal use was confirmed due to the absence of B. cereus toxin genes, and the isolate&#8217;s pH and salt tolerances were investigated. Moreover, the isolate was highly inhibitory to crustacean pathogens in the family Vibrionaceae. Methods to investigate the gut microbiota using the full cycle 16S rRNA methodology were optimized. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes designed specifically targeting B. pumilus, B. subtilis and B. licheniformis, commercially available probiotics, were validated for specificity and optimal hybridization conditions. For FISH analysis of bacteria in situ in histological sections of shrimp midgut trunks, fixation times in 4 % paraformaldehyde wereoptimizedfor bacterial RNA retention whilst maintaining tissue integrity. Due to the broad range of autofluorescence in the shrimp tissue, spectral imaging is required to adequately differentiate between host tissue and multiple bacterial probes. The richness and diversity of the midgut microbiota of animals treated with the novel strain of B. pumiluswere analyzed using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and FISH analysis of histological sections. It was confirmed that B. pumilus can enter the midgut via top-coated feed and through water inoculation. In the tanks that were treated with B. pumilus the proportion of Vibrio sp. in the microbial community decreased, however, only in the systems in which B. pumilus was recovered from the shrimp midgut did the proportion of pathogenic Vibrio species decrease. The application of the B. pumilus caused a shift in the shrimp midgut microbiota, but the community returned to its initial diversity over time. The midgut microbiota of P. monodon is relatively stable but can be adjusted using probiotics. The transience or residence of the probiotics is strain-specific and should be tested for any new strains before determining optimum application protocols. The methods designed in this study are applicable to future research in this field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Probiotics</field><field name="subject">Microbial Community</field><field name="subject">penaeid shrimp</field><field name="subject">Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH)</field><field name="subject">Bacillus</field><field name="subject">Midgut</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drivers, facilitators and barriers to health personnel role development: a case study of factors influencing the development of the oral health role of Indigenous Health Workers in the Cape York region of Australia, 2005-2008.</field><field name="creator">David Walker</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Introduction Oral diseases have a severe impact on rural and remote Indigenous communities of Australia with widespread, severe dental caries leading to a significant number of Indigenous children requiring multiple dental extractions under general anaesthesia each year; a scenario rarely seen elsewhere in Australia. This burden of oral disease occurs in these communities in the context of very limited availability of dental personnel and access to oral health care. The rural and remote Indigenous communities of Australia rely on Indigenous Health Workers as key primary health care personnel. Experience in Western Australia and the Northern Territory suggests that the oral health role of these personnel can be developed to improve community oral health and reduce the burden of oral disease in Indigenous communities. The development of the Indigenous Health Worker oral health role is supported by major stakeholders including: the peak Indigenous health organisation, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation; the peak dental health organisation, the Australian Dental Association; and by Australia&#8217;s National Oral Health Plan. Yet limited progress has been made in the development of this role. Why? This case study seeks to answer this question through the exploration of the complex, multiple factors influencing the development of the oral health role of Indigenous Health Workers in the Cape York region and so support the development of this role among Indigenous Health Workers. Methodology This research was conducted in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council&#8217;s Statement and Guidelines for ethical conduct of Indigenous health research. Ongoing consultation took place with key Indigenous health organisations of the region. including Apunipima Cape York Health Council, Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service and the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Worker Training Aboriginal Corporation, to confirm that the research focus was a priority of the communities of the region and to gain input into the design and implementation of the project. With the support of these Indigenous health organisations the study focused on the three communities in which an initial introduction to oral health promotion was provided to Indigenous Health Workers by Queensland Health through its Crocodile Smiles Project. Qualitative methodologies were used with data collection in the region undertaken through semi-structured interviews with 58 health personnel in the remote Indigenous communities of Hopevale, Napranum and Yarrabah; and in the regional centres of Cairns, Cooktown and Weipa. These interviews explored the perceptions of Indigenous Health Workers, dental personnel and their co-workers regarding the priority, characteristics and support needs of the development of the Indigenous Health Worker oral health role in the region. Results Interviews with rural and remote health personnel highlighted the severe impact of oral disease in these communities and on their health services and the high priority given to the development of the Indigenous Health Worker oral health role. These health personnel are seen as key to Indigenous health promotion in the region. Contrasting perspectives were found among rural and remote health personnel regarding the characteristics of an appropriate Indigenous Health Worker oral health role with consistent support being given to the development of the oral health promotion role and varied perspectives found concerning the development of a clinical oral health role. Rural and remote health personnel also highlighted the significant barriers to the development of the Indigenous Health Worker oral health role existing at the clinic and regional levels. Conclusion This study identifies drivers of role development as including oral health needs and oral health skills shortages in rural and remote Indigenous communities of Cape York. Facilitators to role development were found to include: the legislative and policy environment; the support of Indigenous Health Workers and their co-workers; and the policies and plans of Queensland Health and the Indigenous Community Controlled Health Organisations of the region. Significant barriers include: the existing work burden of Health Workers; the lack of clarity of Health Worker role definition; and the difficulties inherent in the development of appropriate inter-professional and cross-cultural training and management support strategies which are able to be implemented in remote settings. The research highlights the complexity of factors to be considered in achieving the system&#172;wide changes needed to support the development of this role and makes recommendations in the areas of policy, training, management and research to best support the development of this role. In focusing on the development of the oral health role of Indigenous Health Workers the study has examined an area of significance to the Indigenous community using culturally sensitive research methods in remote settings and has addressed a significant though little explored area of dental research &#8211; the development of the oral health role of non-dental personnel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous Oral Health</field><field name="subject">Indigenous Health Worker</field><field name="subject">Workforce Development</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Being Modern: Modernity, sex, and reproductive health among the srey kalip of Phnom Penh</field><field name="creator">Katia Peterson</field><field name="description">Cambodian youth live in a country undergoing rapid development and modernization. The srey kalip or modern women of Phnom Penh are an emerging demographic group of young urban females driving social change in the context of globalization. Despite their obvious presence in society, very little is known about this growing demographic and even less is known about their sexual behavior. This research employed a range of ethnographic methodologies in order to capture one essence of Phnom Penh&#8217;s modern women&#8212;their reproductive health seeking behavior. The results of this study indicate that the adoption of a modern identity has changed constructions of traditional Khmer femininity. This introduced &#8220;liberalism&#8221; challenges traditional ideas about what it means to be a Khmer woman and what it means to be a sexual woman. The srey kalip&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health needs present a much broader profile than the existing health system is capable of providing for. The availability of existing sexual and reproductive health services does not dovetail with their modern identity. This inability to acquire adequate reproductive health care is a consequence of the disjunction between the srey kalip&#8217;s modern identity and a less modern health system. The tension between the modern and traditional body are drawn into focus when the srey kalip seek medical care for reproductive health services and are unable to obtain care that meets their unique needs. This is not a problem restricted to Cambodia. Many developing nations around the world have populations of urban youth who are more globally interconnected and more modern than their parent&#8217;s generation. Ministries of Health and health service providers around the world need to develop innovative and dynamic strategies to meet the sexual health needs of their burgeoning modern youth populations. The opportunity to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of youth is a task that Ministries of Health around the world cannot afford to waste.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cambodia</field><field name="subject">modernity</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">globalization</field><field name="subject">sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">reproductive health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ACCOUNT OF A CONTEMPORARY REMOTE URBAN INDIGENOUS ETHNOMEDICAL SYSTEM AND THE SOCIO-CLINICAL REALITY SHAPED BY THE RESERVE DWELLERS AND THE HOSPITAL RESIDENTS IN THE 1980s</field><field name="creator">Robyn Mobbs</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study in medical anthropology is a critically interpretative analysis of fieldwork documentation I recorded during field research conducted in the mining city of Mount Isa in the far northwest of Queensland during the 1980s. Eighteen months of participant observation research was undertaken over four fieldtrips (1981-82, 1983, 1985 and 1988) at inter-connected locations: two urban reserves for Aborigines and the people I refer to as the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the local hospital and a group of hospital resident medical officers who I refer to as the Residents. During the field research I found that both Reserve Dwellers and the Residents experienced a difficult relationship during their interactions in medical consultations in the hospital clinics. Now in this dissertation I ask an overarching question of my time-lag field data. It is How can we understand the problematic relationship between indigenous reserve-dwelling help-seekers and biomedical practitioners at their local hospital clinics in the 1980s. To describe this problematic relationship I analyse time-lag data from my diaried participant observation at both the reserves and the hospital; semi-structured interviews with the hospital Residents; case studies and case histories of consenting help-seekers from the Reserves; and illustrative transcriptions of consultations between Residents and Reserve Dwellers that were tape recorded by the Residents during hospital clinics. The contemporary ethnomedical system of the Reserve Dwellers was inclusive of biomedicalized clinics and the Residents as clinicians at this remote hospital in the 1980s. I provide an ethnographic account of a changing contemporary indigenous ethnomedical system and describe the lifeways of the Reserve Dwellers in the 1980s; their pattern of help-seeking at their local hospital including grievous happenings; and their experiences in outpatients clinics and the emergency section of the local non-indigenous hospital. Their lifeways and help-seeking were in many ways defined by the collective sociality of Kalkadunga and other regional indigenous cultures as impoverished, very sick survivors of a genocidal contact history less than 100 years before. This local history is also reconstructed. The Residents view of local indigenous illness, help-seeking, and experiences of biomedicalised hospital clinics further describe the socio-cultural reality of the time. I found that the Residents had an insightful, even predictive assessment of local illness burden. At the same time, they held strong views about a pattern of help-seeking in the outpatients and emergency clinics that was considered disruptive of hospital routines. I also describe how they expressed their difficulties interacting with Aboriginal help-seekers including the taking of biomedical histories. My thesis is that a localized socio-clinical reality was shaped by a synchronic, coeval relationship between Reserve Dwellers enculturated within a changing, contemporary ethnomedical belief system that incorporated biomedicalized hospital clinics, and the Residents as clinicians enculturated within a culture of biomedical science at a remote hospital. I argue that the lifeways and pattern of help-seeking of the Reserve Dwellers, as well as the Residents&#8217; views about sick indigenous help-seekers, formed this particular socio-clinical reality. It was then consistently replicated by problematic socio-clinical interaction and biomedicalized praxis that inhibited investigation and curative outcomes for the Reserve Dwellers and other indigenous help-seekers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal health and hospitals, indigenous lifeways, indigenous help-seeking, socio-clinical reality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nanobubbles and the Nanobubble Bridging Capillary Force</field><field name="creator">Marc Hampton</field><field name="description">Interactions between hydrophobic surfaces at short separation distances (at the nanometer scale) are very important in a number of industrial applications. For example, in the froth flotation mineral separation process it is the interaction between the hydrophobic particle and the bubble which is paramount in separating the valuable minerals from the gangue. A number of studies, most notably using the atomic force microscope (AFM) and the surface force apparatus (SFA) have found the existence of a long range hydrophobic attractive force between hydrophobic surfaces that cannot be explained by classical colloidal science theories. In many cases, this force is an artefact due to the accumulation of sub-microscopic bubbles, the so called nanobubbles, at the liquid-hydrophobic solid interface. Thus, what was thought to be a hydrophobic force was actually a capillary force resulting from the gaseous bridge formed from the coalescence of nanobubbles, that is, the nanobubble bridging capillary force (NBCF). It is the purpose of this thesis to provide further insight into the accumulation of soluble gases at the liquid-hydrophobic solid interface and the resulting NBCF. Specifically, this thesis studies these phenomena from a fundamental standpoint and additionally relates the findings to froth flotation mineral separation. A systematic method to measure the NBCF by controlling the size of the gaseous capillary bridge was devised in this thesis. Control of the capillary bridge was achieved by utilising the solvent-exchange method to accumulate nanobubbles at the surface, followed by surface scanning of the colloidal probe over the flat surface to harvest nanobubbles. Thus, the NBCF has been controlled to allow for greater success in modelling the interaction, understanding the geometric parameters of the bridge, observing changes in friction force due to nanobubbles and understanding the influence of ethanol on the force. An outcome of this thesis was the development of a capillary force model which describes the NBCF. The model considers a constant volume and constant contact angle assumption for a gaseous capillary bridge of toroidal geometry. The model was very successful in describing the NBCF at long separation distances (&gt;20nm) for both the approach and retract interactions. The close fitting between the experimental data and the model allowed accurate determinations of the advancing and receding contact angles, bridge geometry and volume. The successful implementation of the capillary force model allowed a link between the bridge volume, and the resulting adhesion to the friction force between hydrophobic solid surfaces in water. Additionally, the model allowed the change from an attractive to a repulsive NBCF to be described by a change from a concave to convex bridge geometry. Thus, this thesis has added considerable knowledge to the fundamental aspects of nanobubbles and the NBCF. The final chapters of this thesis utilised the knowledge gained from the fundamental studies to understand the influence of nanobubbles on flotation. In the first study, the influence of NaCl concentration on the morphology of gaseous domains on a graphite surface is discussed in relation to the increased recovery of coal in saline water. In the second study, methanol treatment of a ZnS ore was found to increase the floatability due to slime removal and the artificial formation of nanobubbles.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanobubbles</field><field name="subject">Nanobubble bridging capillary force</field><field name="subject">Capillarity</field><field name="subject">Nanopancakes</field><field name="subject">atomic force microscopy (AFM)</field><field name="subject">dissolved gas</field><field name="subject">flotation</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">Friction</field><field name="subject">Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Surface Modification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parallel and Sequential Monte Carlo Methods with Applications</field><field name="creator">Gareth Evans</field><field name="description">Monte Carlo simulation methods are becoming increasingly important for solving difficult optimization problems. Monte Carlo methods are often used when it is infeasible to determine an exact result via a deterministic algorithm, such as with NP or #P problems. Several recent Monte Carlo techniques employ the idea of importance sampling; examples include the Cross-Entropy method and sequential importance sampling. The Cross-Entropy method is a relatively new Monte Carlo technique that has been successfully applied to a wide range of optimization and estimation problems since introduced by R. Y. Rubinstein in 1997. However, as the problem size increases, the Cross-Entropy method, like many heuristics, can take an exponentially increasing amount of time before it returns a solution. For large problems this can lead to an impractical amount of running time. A main aim of this thesis is to develop the Cross-Entropy method for large-scale parallel computing, allowing the running time of a Cross-Entropy program to be significantly reduced by the use of additional computing resources. The effectiveness of the parallel approach is demonstrated via a number of numerical studies. A second aim is to apply the Cross-Entropy method and sequential importance sampling to biological problems, in particular the multiple change-point problem for DNA sequences. The multiple change-point problem in a general setting is the problem of identifying, given a particular sequence of numbers/characters, a point along that sequence where some property of interest changes abruptly. An example in a biological setting, is identifying points in a DNA sequence where there is a significant change in the proportion of the nucleotides G and C with respect to the nucleotides A and T. We show that both sequential importance sampling and the Cross-Entropy approach yield significant improvements in time and/or accuracy over existing techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Cross-Entropy, Parallel Cross-Entropy, Optimization, Parallel optimization, Change-point</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic etiology of human sexuality</field><field name="creator">Brendan Zietsch</field><field name="description">Sexuality is central to our individual lives, our society, and our evolution, but its etiology is not thoroughly understood. Using data from 4904 Australian twins who completed a questionnaire on sexual attitudes and behaviours, I investigated the genetic and environmental influences underlying variation in and covariation between psychological and behavioural aspects of sexuality. Moreover, I explored the role of sexuality traits in several different contexts: evolution, mental health, public health, personality, and problematic behaviour. Before presenting reports of the four main empirical studies in this thesis, I make the case for the importance of studying human sexuality, outline previous findings on the etiology of individual differences in sexuality, and describe the behavioural genetic principles and techniques that were used in the investigations. I also present an additional fifth paper reporting a behavioural genetic analysis of EEG power, which I undertook in order to learn twin data modelling and complex multivariate techniques. In the first empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from an evolutionary perspective. As sexual orientation is genetically influenced, it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in the population at a relatively high frequency. I tested the hypothesis that while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals&#8217; reproductive success, they may confer some advantage for heterosexuals who carry them. Results showed that psychologically masculine females and feminine men are 1) more likely to be nonheterosexual, but 2) when they are heterosexual have more opposite-sex sexual partners. Genetic modelling revealed that both these relationships are partly due to pleiotropic genetic influences common to each trait. Further, heterosexuals with a nonheterosexual twin had more opposite-sex partners than do heterosexual twin pairs. Taken together, these results suggest that genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could contribute to the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population. In the second empirical paper I investigated sexual orientation from the perspective of mental health risk. Large epidemiological studies have shown that homosexuals are at much greater risk of psychiatric disorder than the general population. This has been assumed, with some supporting evidence, to be because of the prejudice and discrimination experienced by homosexuals in a heterosexist society. Here I tested the viability of alternative explanations, using Eysenck&#8217;s Neuroticism and Psychoticism scales as markers for psychiatric vulnerability. Firstly, I tested whether apparent sexual orientation differences in psychiatric vulnerability simply mirror sex differences &#8211; for our traits, this would predict nonheterosexual males having elevated Neuroticism scores as females do, and nonheterosexual females having elevated Psychoticism scores as males do. The results contradicted this idea, with nonheterosexual men and women scoring significantly higher on both Neuroticism and Psychoticism than their heterosexual counterparts, suggesting an overall elevation of psychiatric risk in nonheterosexuals. Secondly, I used the genetically informative sample to assess the viability of explanations invoking a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability. We found significant genetic correlations between sexual orientation and both Neuroticism and Psychoticism, but no corresponding environmental correlations, suggesting that if there is a common cause of both nonheterosexuality and psychiatric vulnerability it is likely to have a genetic basis rather than an environmental basis. The third empirical paper investigated the etiology of risky sexual behaviour, which is relevant to public health and welfare through its role in STD transmission and unwanted pregnancies. Results showed that variation in risky sexual behaviour is due to genetic, shared environmental, and unshared environmental influences to approximately equal degrees. The genetic influences partly overlapped with genetic influences on dispositional factors, with significant genetic correlations between risky sexual behaviour and Eysenck&#8217;s Impulsivity, Extraversion, Psychoticism, and Neuroticism. This suggests that the genetic influences that shape our personality may also predispose us to risky sexual behaviour. The fourth empirical paper investigated the etiology of a strong association (r = .50) between risky sexual behaviour and adolescent misconduct. Results indicated that the association is due to overlapping genetic and environmental influences, but that in males genes are the primary source of the association whereas in females shared environment plays the greater role. These findings suggest that a general predisposition to risky behaviour may manifest in different potentially harmful ways in adolescence (misconduct) and adulthood (risky sexual behaviour), and that different processes are involved in male and female etiology. Following the empirical reports, I provide a general discussion of my research findings and the study of human sexuality more generally. After summarising the findings and their implications, I then provide a detailed description of potential limitations of the research and to what extent they qualify the conclusions drawn. I also critically discuss the absence of sexuality traits from the major models of personality, and why this and other shortcomings make the personality models inadequate from an evolutionary perspective. Finally, I suggest directions for future research in light of the research and discussion presented in this thesis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twins</field><field name="subject">sexuality</field><field name="subject">sexual orientation</field><field name="subject">homosexuality</field><field name="subject">risky sexual behaviour</field><field name="subject">genetic</field><field name="subject">environmental</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using wildlife tourism and post-visit support to enhance families&#8217; conservation learning at Mon Repos Conservation Park</field><field name="creator">Karen Hughes</field><field name="description">Abstract Nature-based tourism and wildlife tourism are becoming increasingly popular worldwide and are often promoted as a means of protecting and preserving environmental resources. These forms of tourism are usually accompanied by interpretation such as signs, presentations and activities specifically designed to raise visitors&#8223; awareness of, and concern for, environmental issues. The rationale behind this approach is that enhancing visitors&#8223; environmental knowledge, understanding and attitudes prompts the adoption of environmentally responsible behaviours. This is supported by a growing body of research that suggests that environmental interpretation has considerable potential to impact upon visitors&#8223; conservation knowledge and attitudes, and that well-designed interpretive experiences and messages are an effective means of reducing a range of negative &#8222;on-site&#8223; behaviours such as littering, straying from walkways and feeding wildlife. However, there has been little exploration of whether environmental interpretation influences the uptake of conservation practices &#8222;off-site&#8223; or how the positive impacts of nature-based tourism can be maintained over time. Until recently, tourism research exploring post-visit behaviour has used visitors&#8223; immediate post-visit intentions as a measure of behaviour change. There is increasing evidence, however, that stated intentions to engage in conservation behaviours rarely manifest as actual behaviour, and that visitors&#8223; on-site enthusiasm and commitment tends to wane following their visit. The current research aimed to investigate whether providing visitors with post-visit support in the form of learning materials and reminders would prevent this decline and enhance long-term conservation learning (hereby defined as knowledge, attitudes and behaviour). This research explores short and long-term changes in families&#8223; conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour following their visit to Mon Repos Conservation Park, a world renowned turtle rookery in Queensland, Australia. Stage one of the study involved surveying 100 Australian families to identify barriers and benefits associated with six conservation practices (re-using containers, buying minimal packaging, reducing use of plastic bags, picking up litter, recycling and composting). Using Community-based Social Marketing theory, responses informed the development of printed and online post-visit action resources specifically designed to reinforce the wildlife tourism experience and support families&#8223; conservation learning. Resources focused on the six conservation behaviours outlined above but also included other environmental activities and conservation information of relevance. v In stage two, two hundred Australian families visiting Mon Repos in December 2007 and January 2008 were sampled and assigned to either a treatment group (provided with post-visit action resources and regular contact) or the control group (no post-visit support). All families were asked to complete pre-visit, post-visit and follow-up questionnaires to enable the researcher to ascertain short-term and long-term changes in their conservation knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and to identify factors contributing to the uptake of off-site conservation practices. The final sample comprised the one hundred families who completed all three questionnaires. Comparisons between responses of the control and treatment groups revealed that post-visit action resources reinforced respondents&#8223; knowledge of threats to turtles and enhanced their attitudes towards protecting wildlife and the natural environment. Families who received post-visit support were also significantly more likely to pick up litter and introduced more conservation actions than those who did not receive this support. Aspects of the post-visit action resources that were particular effective were updates of turtle activity at Mon Repos, emails, fact sheets and the newsletter. Other factors that prompted the adoption of conservation practices included Mon Repos&#8223; interpretation and the opportunity to view wildlife in its natural surroundings. The influence of other family members and pre-visit knowledge and interest were also found to be associated with subsequent uptake of conservation behaviours. Implications for wildlife interpretive practice and the design and delivery of post-visit support are discussed and recommendations for future research presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conservation learning</field><field name="subject">wildlife tourism</field><field name="subject">family learning</field><field name="subject">behaviour change</field><field name="subject">Community-Based Social Marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First aid treatment of burn injuries: Optimum treatment and mechanisms of action</field><field name="creator">Leila Cuttle</field><field name="description">There are many public health organizations with guidelines concerning the best first-aid treatment for burn injuries. The Australian and New Zealand Burn Association recommends that a burn wound should be cooled with tap water (8-20&#176;C) for 20 minutes, up to three hours after the injury has occurred. However, the evidence that these guidelines are based on is inconclusive and contradictory. As a result of the conflicting published data, there is controversy over whether ice water or ice may confer any beneficial wound healing effects, and what temperature of water is optimal. In the wider community there are also many different alternative therapies believed to be beneficial for the treatment of burn injuries which do not have much evidence to support their use. In this study, patients were found to use agents such as Aloe vera, tea tree oil dressings, butter, toothpaste, papaya ointment and moisturizer on the burn wound. The aim of this work was to review the current field of first-aid treatment for burn injuries and obtain evidence for the optimum first aid treatment using a good animal model, with clinically relevant assessments of wound healing and scar formation. The mechanisms behind the best first aid treatment were also investigated in an effort to better understand and identify the factors involved in optimal wound healing. Studies showed that cool running water at 15&#176;C and 2&#176;C improved the speed of wound healing, gave a better cosmetic outcome and decreased amounts of scar tissue compared to untreated controls. Other treatments Aloe vera, tea tree oil dressings, ice and saliva did not improve wound healing compared to untreated controls. All cold treatments acted to decrease the subdermal temperature, however as the running water was beneficial for wound healing whereas the ice was not, this suggests that the running water acts through other non-thermal mechanisms. Further studies showed that immediate treatment with 15&#176;C water for 20 minutes duration significantly improved the re-epithelialization for 2 weeks post-burn and decreased the distribution of scar tissue compared to untreated controls, however durations as short as 10 minutes and delays of treatment for 1 hour (and perhaps longer) were also beneficial. An audit of first aid used by pediatric patients demonstrated that although 86.1% of patients used first aid, only 12.1% applied the recommended first aid treatment of cold water for 20 or more minutes. For those that did use correct first aid, re-epithelialization time and number of hospital visits were significantly reduced for children with contact and flame burns, respectively. Inadequate first aid treatment was also found to be more common for children &lt;3.5 years old and for friction burn injuries. These studies provide compelling evidence that correct first aid treatment of burn injuries results in improved clinical outcomes, which benefit the patient as well as health care providers. There is a definite need for greater public awareness concerning the correct first aid treatment to use for burn injuries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">burn, first-aid, cold, water, ice, temperature, duration, delay, alternative, treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A perception-influence model of innovation implementation in project related based engineering</field><field name="creator">Miller, Andrew</field><field name="description">Innovation is an imperative in all industry sectors. For those such as construction, which are not considered high-tech and which operate as one-off projects, the uptake and diffusion of new innovations into ongoing practice across projects pose particular problems. The nature of these problems faced at a project level needs to be better understood. This thesis is an exploration of innovation implementation in the context of Project-Based Engineering (PBE). It is an empirical investigation of how new planning technologies are implemented in major infrastructure construction projects and the barriers that prevent such implementations from being effective. The findings of this investigation are used to develop and evaluate a new model of innovation implementation in this context. The research design is centred on the immersion of a participant-observer in seven live construction projects over a period of 3.5 years. Each project studied was implementing the same innovation: 4D CAD modelling (3D design model + the construction schedule). A wide cross-section of data was gathered in the field including direct observations, documents and other work products from participation, email and other correspondence associated with the 4D CAD implementations, and formal and informal discussions with project-participants. These data were analysed using content analysis software to find patterns. The research was iterative and involved three phases. The initial phase was a pilot study of implementation in practice using the data from one project. It produced rich descriptions of what transpired and a critical comparison with accounts from the literature. This led to a series of propositions about the influence of project-participant perceptions that were synthesised into a new theoretical model: the initial Perception-Influence model (P-I1 model). The middle research phase then developed this model iteratively using a more-focused data collection and content analysis across four construction project organisations. This was done to provide supporting evidence for the theoretical constructs in the P-I1 model as well as to refine them and add new ones. The outcomes of the middle phase were the P-I2 and P-I3 models. The final research phase analysed the data from the last two project organisations in terms of the P-I model framework with a view to evaluating the model&#8217;s theoretical significance and practical applications. The P-I model shows that negative perceptions of value, benefit and usability can cause an innovation implementation to be ineffective as a result of discontinued use or neglect. It provides a map for the progression of an implementation using the perceptions and actions of project-participants as primary constructs. The model proposes that each perception is formed by a number of contributing factors or secondary constructs synthesised from implementation research and user acceptance literature, for example, an opinion or concern about how much an innovation costs (i.e. transaction costs). It also proposes that each perception has both a positive and negative associated action. The constructs that make up the P-I model are grounded in the empirical data. This is because the actions, opinions and concerns of project-participants observed in live projects are evident in project documentation such as emails. These two sources (i.e. observations and project documentation) provide data sets that were used to triangulate inferences about the perceptions of project-participants and the outcome of each 4D CAD implementation (i.e. effective or otherwise). This aspect of the research was not only important for the recommendation of potential applications for the P-I model but also during its conception, development and evaluation. The P-I model is a new and important perspective for both implementation research and PBE practitioners. It helps satisfy the calls for studies of innovation implementation that focus on factors at an individual level and those asking for a better understanding of innovative behaviour. This work shows PBE practitioners how the perceptions of project-participants can have a major impact on the effectiveness of an innovation implementation. The findings provide an evidential basis that can improve implementation effectiveness, especially in PBE organisations. The knowledge built into the P-I model can also assist the planning and execution of innovation implementation strategies, aid in the assessment and redirection of those in progress, and help document lessons learned for implementations within project organisations that have been previously completed. This research uses the P-I model to open the way for future empirical studies of innovation implementation in PBE contexts beyond construction. These would also provide data to further refine the constructs in the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">Innovation implementation</field><field name="subject">Project-based engineering</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="subject">Influence</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of Separating Flows in the X2 Expansion Tube Over Bluff Aerocapture Vehicles</field><field name="creator">Adriaan Window</field><field name="description">Blunt-nosed sphere-cone aeroshell vehicles have played an integral part in space exploration to date and their use is set to continue into the next decade and beyond. While these vehicles have been flight proven with four decades of heritage, design uncertainties in aft body thermal protection systems in the order of 300-400% exist due to the as yet unpredictable flowfield characteristics of the near-wake region of these vehicles at hypersonic speeds. Attempts have been made to reduce this uncertainty but current technology in the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) still requires phenomenological models to be developed that accurately predict base heating rates. Expansion tube experimental facilities have the potential for aiding in the reduction of this design uncertainty. However, it is not known whether the X2 or X3 expansion tubes at the University of Queensland can be employed to obtain data for assisting the development of CFD modelling techniques. A survey of the current best practices in CFD modelling techniques is presented. Preliminary CFD models have been developed to resolve the macroscopic features of the wake flows around the Mars Pathfinder aeroshell geometry. A series of experiments have been performed and the duration of time average steady heating is documented. Results of experimentation indicated that the X2 impulse machine operating in expansion tube mode is capable of generating a sufficient length of steady flow for the study of near-wake phenomena. This is documented in flow conditions using CO2 to simulate Martian flight conditions. It was also demonstrated that flow speeds and model dimensions must be matched appropriately to allow for sufficient test time. A method for the sizing of experimental models is also presented for the study of heat transfer in near-wake flow fields. Example model geometries are prescribed for a variety of flow conditions for the X2 expansion tube.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making war real: the discourse of professional journalism and the Iraq War, 2003.</field><field name="creator">Giles Dodson</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT As this thesis argues, the pursuit of professionalism in journalism should be understood as a discourse that hegemonises the discursive formation of journalism and produces news that fulfils professional needs. Professionalism articulates and states its object, in this case war, rather than apprehending it through fidelity to normative criteria, such as the objective truth of &#8216;reality&#8217;. Conceiving of professional journalism as such provides a means of understanding and analysing media production outside of the theoretical bounds of &#8216;ideology critique&#8217;. Empirically, this thesis takes Australian war journalism during the invasion of Iraq, 2003, and professional journalistic discourse observed in interview with a selection of Australian Iraq war correspondents as its object of analysis. Previous analyses and critiques of journalism generally, and war journalism specifically, rely heavily on some conception of journalism as ideological. As this thesis argues this category of analysis is theoretically redundant and the discourse perspective provides a more fecund and insightful critique of journalism. The thesis provides a historical and critical account of professionalism&#8217;s emergence, eventual domination and hegemony of the journalistic field. It is argued that professionalism, as an articulation of social and cultural norms, retains its central cultural legitimacy in journalism, and is expressed through the journalistic norms of objectivity, independence and news values. It is argued that within the contemporary cultural conditions of postmodernism and neo-liberalism these modern norms are no-longer credible and useful in journalism. The empirical analysis of the professional discourse undertaken by the thesis demonstrates journalism as a pragmatic and contingent process of meaning creation, which legitimates and normalises its practices, forms and pre-occupations. In this sense the discourse, as a regime and process of meaning creation, produces its object, or makes war &#8216;real&#8217; for news audiences, rather than reflecting the independent reality of war. In the context of the Iraq invasion, 2003, the thesis reveals many limitations, contradictions and inconsistencies within journalistic norms and subjectivities. The thesis also demonstrates how the discursive needs of professional journalism tend to be coincident with the strategic communication intent of military and political power. This stands in marked contrast to journalism&#8217;s professed normative democratic function and to analyses of war journalism that consider this normative function irresistibly dominated by military and political power.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism, war, professionalism, discourse, conflict, media, Iraq, Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterisation of three modifiers of murine metastable epialleles (Mommes)</field><field name="creator">Nadia Whitelaw</field><field name="description">The epigenetic contribution to phenotype is now well established. Studies over the past decade have shown that proteins that are able to establish and propagate epigenetic modifications are essential for mammalian development. Some of the genes involved in these processes have been identified, but the roles of many remain unknown. The mutagenesis screens for modifiers of position effect variegation in Drosophila suggest that there are over 200 genes that are able to modify epigenetic variegation. We emulated this screen in the mouse to identify mammalian modifiers of a variegating transgene. The screen aimed to identify novel genes involved in epigenetic reprogramming, and to generate mouse models to study the impact of disruption to the epigenome. Inbred male mice carrying a variegating GFP transgene expressed in erythrocytes were mutagenised with ENU. Offspring were screened by flow cytometry and in the initial rounds of mutagenesis, 11 dominant mutant lines were identified. These lines were called MommeDs (Modifiers of murine metastable epialleles, dominant). This thesis describes the mapping and phenotypic characterisation of three Momme lines: MommeD7, MommeD8 and MommeD9. The MommeD9 mutation enhances variegation and was mapped to a 3.4 Mb interval on Chromosome 7. A mutation in a 5? splice site was found in the Trim28 gene. Analysis of Trim28 mRNA and protein in heterozygotes showed that the mutant allele was null. Homozygotes die before mid-gestation. Heterozygotes are viable but display variable and complex phenotypes, including infertility, obesity, behavioural abnormalities and premature death. Obese MommeD9 mice have liver steatosis, impaired glucose tolerance and other indicators of metabolic syndrome. This phenotype has not previously been reported for mice haploinsufficient for Trim28. There is considerable variability of phenotypes among inbred MommeD9 heterozygotes, which suggests a role for epigenetics in phenotypic noise or &#8220;intangible variation&#8221;. MommeD8 is a semi-dominant enhancer of variegation. Some homozygotes are viable but some die around birth. Viable homozygotes weigh less than wildtype littermates and have increased CpG methylation at the GFP transgene enhancer element. The mutation was mapped to a 4 Mb interval on chromosome 4. Extensive candidate gene sequencing failed to find a mutation and so DNA from mutant and wildtype individuals were sequenced across the entire linked interval by 454 Sequencing technology. MommeD8 individuals carry two point mutations, one is intergenic and the other lies in an intron of the Ppie gene. Analysis of Ppie mRNA in heterozygotes and homozygotes shows that mutants have reduced transcript levels, suggesting that a deficiency in Ppie causes the increased silencing of GFP. The Ppie gene has not been reported to be involved in epigenetic reprogramming and little is known about its function. Mice heterozygous for MommeD7 have a marked increase in expression of GFP. Heterozygotes have a range of hematopoietic abnormalities including splenomegaly, anaemia and reticulocytosis. Homozygotes die at birth and appear pale. The increased GFP in the peripheral blood appears to be the consequence of an increase in reticulocytes. The mutation is linked to a 1.5 Mb interval on Chromosome 7. MommeD7 mice appear to have hematopoietic abnormalities that affect the expression of the erythroid-specific GFP reporter transgene. MommeD7 mice serve as a reminder that, as well as discovering bona fide modifiers of epigenetic reprogramming, the ENU screen can also identify hematopoietic mutants.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transgene silencing</field><field name="subject">variegation</field><field name="subject">modifiers of epigenetic reprogramming</field><field name="subject">mouse mutagenesis</field><field name="subject">DNA methylation</field><field name="subject">intangible variation</field><field name="subject">complex disease</field><field name="subject">Trim28</field><field name="subject">Ppie</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeting Genes for Identification and Treatment of Renal Cell Carcinoma.</field><field name="creator">Retnagowri Rajandram</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT There is an increasing incidence of neoplasms in the kidney and a poor prognosis for patients who are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic kidney cancer. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) constitutes the most prevalent form of kidney neoplasm in the adult population. Although surgery or cryoablation are successful curative treatments for localized RCC, improved diagnostic methods facilitating early detection and characterization of renal tumours may enable more effective use of less invasive treatments, especially for metastases. Currently there are no suitable tumour markers available for diagnostic, prognostic or predictive purposes. By increasing our knowledge of the underlying molecular characteristics of RCC, we may be able to identify molecular pathways involved in tumour growth and metastasis, and this knowledge may expedite the development of targeted therapies, and may identify useful markers of RCC development and progression. This thesis aimed to identify new genes involved in resistance to cancer therapy in RCC and to analyse their incidence and test their function in human RCC tissue, using immunohistochemistry in a large cohort of patients with RCC and paired normal tissue, and in vitro models. The lack of induction of apoptosis in RCCs by conventional cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation is central to their resistance to treatment. If apoptotic pathways that are activated in successful treatments were identified, they might be used for targets in future therapies. The hypothesis tested in this thesis was that genes or proteins involved in the molecular control of apoptosis, identified from RCC cell culture models and RNA microarray, will be useful for molecular profiling in human RCCs of different subtypes, as markers of those specific subtypes of the RCCs, as indicators of prognosis of the diagnosis, or as targets for future therapy regimens. The broad aims of this project were: To establish a model in which significantly increased apoptosis in RCCs in cell culture could be correlated with alterations in apoptotic pathway genes, to investigate the functional significance of some of those genes; and to maximise information gained from these basic experimental laboratory studies on new apoptosis genes in RCC development and progression by determining their expression patterns in tissue microarrays (TMAs) generated from different subtypes of human RCCs. The specific aims of the project were: 1) To establish an RCC cell culture model with high levels of induced apoptosis for RNA analyses using microarray to identified apoptotic genes that are novel in RCC investigations; 2) To describe the role and functional significance of some of the novel RCC apoptosis pathway genes using molecular investigations, including silencing RNA techniques; and 3) To use TMAs and immunohistochemistry to determine whether RCC subtypes can be distinguished by protein expression profiles of selected new apoptosis pathway genes. The thesis is presented as a literature review (Chapter 1), materials and methods (Chapter 2), four original research segments (Chapters 3 to 6), and finally a segment that summarises the results and presents future directions (Chapter 7). The first of the original research Chapters (Chapter 3) addressed a question &#8220;can apoptosis in RCCs be induced in cell culture to such a level that apoptotic pathways may be analysed?&#8221; Two RCC cell lines (ACHN and SN12K-1) were treated with IFN-a (500IU/mL), radiotherapy (20 Gy) or dual therapy of these two treatments. Apoptosis was quantified using microscopy and morphological characteristics and verified using enzymatic labelling of cells. The ACHN cell line, treated with the dual therapy and analysed at 24 hours, had a significantly increased level of apoptosis (p&lt;0.05) compared with the non-therapy treated controls, and negligible mitosis. The increased expression or activation of at least some known apoptotic pathway genes (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, 8 and 9, and p53) was verified in this model. The ACHN/dual therapy model was selected for further study. The second of the original research Chapters (Chapter 4) addressed the question &#8220;what apoptosis-regulating genes are significantly different in the apoptotic ACHN cells?&#8221; An RNA microarray assay (112 apoptosis-related genes) was carried out using RNA extracted from treated and non-treated ACHN cells and analysed for alterations of at least 1.9-fold in transcript levels. 21 genes had upregulated transcript levels in the treated cells, and one had down-regulated transcript levels. A search of the literature revealed three gene families with altered transcript levels in the treated RCCs that were novel: the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF), caspase recruitment domain (CARD) and cell death-inducing DFF-45 effector (CIDE) gene families. Representative members of these families were then investigated for protein expression alterations. The results for one particular gene, TRAF1, indicated it might be worthy of further study in modulation experiments (Chapter 6). The next research chapter (Chapter 5) asked the question &#8220;since the ACHN cells express TRAF-1 and have increased TRAF-1 with increasing apoptosis, what happens to the levels of mitosis and apoptosis in these cells when TRAF-1 expression is knocked down?&#8221; Silencing RNA (siRNA) techniques were used to knock down TRAF-1 in the ACHN RCC cell line using the same model as was described in Chapter 3. Successful knock down was gained after 72 hrs of transfection with a commercially-available siRNA against TRAF-1. These cells were then treated with the radiation, IFN-&#945; or dual therapy treatments. In the cells with TRAF-1 knock down, there was significantly less apoptosis and more mitosis than was seen in the non-transfected cells. These results indicate that TRAF-1 does play a functional role in induction of apoptosis in RCCs and is worth investigating further in targeted therapies. The final of the research Chapters (Chapter 6) looked at the molecular distinctions among ccRCC, papillary, collecting duct, chromophobe and unclassified types of RCC. Molecules that might distinguish one from another would be valuable clinically, and it would be especially valuable if these molecules could also be targeted for therapeutic benefit. By knowing the action of these molecules in the apoptotic pathways used by RCCs when they do regress or die during cancer therapies, we might be able to devise new targeted therapies for RCCs. This research Chapter asked the question &#8220;could molecular profiling with an array of apoptotic pathway genes, novel to investigations in RCCs, provide information that would distinguish the subtypes?&#8221; TMAs prepared from 121 RCC and paired normal patient samples, where available, were investigated. Most RCC samples were ccRCC. Antibodies against selected members of the TRAF), CARD and CIDE gene families were selected from the RNA microarray data. These genes (TRAF1, TRAF3, TRAF4, inhibitor of caspase-activated DNAase/ICAD and nucleolar protein-3/NOL3) were analysed in TMAs using immunohistochemistry and digital scanning or bright field microscopy and graded scales of intensity and distribution, blinded to sub-type of RCC. After microscopy, scores for subtypes of RCC were compared with their normal tissue. Significant differences were found for TRAF1 and NOL3. The results indicate TRAF1 and NOL3 have potential for improving outcome or diagnosis in RCCs. In summary, there are no effective treatments against metastatic RCC, and no suitable grade or stage-defining biomarker for metastatic RCC subtypes. One of the main reasons for therapy resistance in RCCs is their inability to use or activate apoptotic pathway molecules. By investigating the reasons for RCC resistance to cancer therapies, we may be able to improve both diagnosis and treatment strategies. By defining the mechanisms and pathways of resistance to therapy-induced apoptosis, and developing methods to manipulate the pathways to cell death to defeat therapy resistance, we will have a better chance to develop successful markers of RCC subtypes and also design new and successful RCC therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kidney</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Renal Cell Carcinoma</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Signalling Pathway</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medicinal Herbs and the Kidney: Unresolved Issues</field><field name="creator">Kenneth Wojcikowski</field><field name="description">In the exploration into new therapeutic agents for human disease, medicinal herbs offer an enormous resource due to their wide range of biologically active components. However, because of these biologically active components, medicinal herbs can also have toxic side effects. The focus of this thesis is the effect of herbal therapies, both good and bad, on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is considered one of the defining characteristics of CKD. In Chapter 1, the literature regarding the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial fibrosis is reviewed, beginning with the mechanisms of its development, the main structural and functional features, and the molecular mediators. The structural features include activation of resident fibroblasts and transition of tubular epithelial cells into myofibroblasts, deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, increased apoptosis of normal cells of the renal nephron and development of tubular atrophy, increased renal oxidative stress, and hypoxia of renal tissues. Molecular mediators that are explored include angiotensin II, transforming growth factor-&#223;1 and numerous other cytokines and growth factors. Pharmacological manipulation of these features and their molecular mediators for regression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis is then discussed. Currently, the gold standard of therapy for people with CKD is blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Because of the complexity of the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis and the multiple mechanisms by which ACEIs and ARBs work, this portion of the thesis focuses on the qualities that additional agents should have to complement their actions. These additional agents could work by decreasing oxidative damage, by decreasing fibroblast numbers through apoptosis, through the interruption of inflammatory, fibrotic mediators, by increasing anti-inflammatory mediators or through other mechanisms. The literature review therefore continues with a discussion of the historical use of medicinal herbs in genitourinary pathologies and the known contributions that medicinal herbs can make to the treatment or development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and CKD. From this review, a large number of herbs were identified as having traditional use in renal disorders or as being of interest, currently, to researchers of renal pathologies. However, much information is lacking regarding the mechanisms by which the hypothesised benefits occur, making it impossible to assess which herb(s) may offer valuable additive support or alternative treatments to the therapies currently given to people with CKD. Furthermore, there is a lack of information regarding toxicity of these herbs; many herbs have never been assessed in cell culture or in animal toxicity studies. It was apparent that preliminary in vitro work was necessary before in vivo pharmacological work could be undertaken. This thesis, therefore, aimed to test the following hypotheses: (1) That medicinal herbs used currently for treatment of renal dysfunction have high anti-oxidant properties that can be further enhanced by specific extraction processes; (2) That the in vitro testing of selected extracts from medicinal herbs, identified in (1), will reveal some anti-oxidant benefits or indications of toxicity that need careful analysis in animal studies; (3) That careful in vivo testing of specific toxic medicinal herbs identified in these leadup studies will define specific pathological processes that predict an outcome of CKD; and (4) That careful in vivo testing of selected medicinal herbs, used in conjunction with more conventional medicines for CKD, will show an additive benefit when used to ameliorate development of CKD induced using an established animal model. The subsequent laboratory work was designed to test the validity of these hypotheses and the results are then presented in Chapters that each comprise a publication. The aim of Chapter 2 was to present a systematic analysis of the oxidant properties of 55 medicinal herbs that have been used traditionally to treat kidney and urinary disorders or have been of recent interest to researchers of renal disorders. Since different extraction processes yield different constituents, each of the herbs was sequentially extracted with three solvents of decreasing polarity. An assay was performed on each of the fractions to determine the oxygen radical absorbance capacity. The aim of Chapter 3 was to test the benefit or otherwise of each of the three extracts of the chosen herbs using an in vitro cell study. Each extract was tested for potential toxic, apoptotic, mutagenic and antioxidant activity on normal mammalian renal tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E). The effect of the extracts on renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) was also analysed. Several specific hypotheses arose from the combination of the systematic analyses and the literature review regarding benefits and toxicities of a number of the extracts. The subsequent in vivo work was designed to test the validity of two of these hypotheses. The aim of Chapter 4 was to test the hypotheses developed from the results of the previous Chapter. The herb Dioscorea villosa had demonstrated extreme cytotoxicity to mammalian renal epithelial cells and had caused transdifferentiation of epithelial cells into fibroblasts. An in vivo rodent model was used to test chronic dosage with this herb and its toxicity and predisposition for induction of CKD verified. The aim of Chapter 5 was to determine whether a herbal preparation (Angelica sinensis and Astragalus membranaceus) that had some support from the literature and the results from Chapters 2 and 3, could complement the actions of ACEIs in a rodent model of renal fibrosis (unilateral ureteral obstruction). The combination of herbal medicines and the ACEI was significantly more effective than the ACEI alone in ameliorating several characteristics of CKD development. To conclude the thesis, Chapter 6 provides an overview discussion of the results and a critical analysis of the methods used. Further, Chapter 6 looks towards future experiments that are planned to further resolve issues of concern about effects on renal health from use of medicinal herbs. .</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Renal fibrosis; medicinal herbs; transforming growth factor &#946;1; oxidative stress; Dioscorea villosa; Angelica sinensis; Astragalus membranaceus; ACE inhibitors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187935</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distribution and fate of persistent organic pollutants in nearshore marine turtle habitats of Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Siobhan Hermanussen</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The tropical and subtropical nearshore marine environments of Queensland, Australia sustain diverse and unique marine wildlife. Continuous population growth and land-use changes along the Queensland coastline are known to exert numerous anthropogenic pressures on these marine ecosystems, including the delivery of high sediment loads. Sediments also provide a transport pathway for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from rural and urban catchments into the marine environment. While such pollutants are known to be elevated in marine sediment and biota from nearshore areas in Queensland, their input and distribution pathways, as well as exposure and associated risks to wildlife populations are only partially understood. Mounting evidence suggests that POPs may contribute to population declines in marine wildlife species; however, limited information is available regarding the accumulation and effects of these contaminants in endangered or threatened marine turtles. This study aimed to redress some of these information gaps using a case study approach in marine turtle habitats of Moreton Bay, and other embayments in Queensland. Among persistent organic pollutants (POPs), dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins; PCDDs) and to some extent also dioxin-like PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls; PCBs) were found to be widespread and often present at elevated (ppb) levels in surface sediments from Moreton Bay. However, while PCDD/F toxic equivalencies (TEQs) are above international (Canadian) sediment quality guidelines at numerous sites in Moreton Bay, in general TEQs across the Bay are relatively low compared to those from contaminated locations near dense industrial activities. POP contamination in surface sediments across Moreton Bay was investigated by a combination of GIS spatial mapping, geostatistical and traditional statistical modalities. High spatial variability and complex spatial distribution patterns were revealed. High resolution GIS kriging model outputs from the mid to southern Bay facilitated identification of distinct sediment contamination zones, with highest PCB and PCDD/F levels present in nearshore locations, associated with nearby river systems. While primarily governed by organic carbon, a multitude of physical, chemical and hydrological factors were identified to influence the spatial variance of PCDD/F concentrations. The main parameters governing PCDD/F spatial distribution were identified as sediment geochemistry, water depth and anthropogenic alterations of the physical environment and, together, all quantifiable explanatory variables (including hydrodynamic flushing) explained &#8776;75% of spatial PCDD/F variance. Together, the interaction of these parameters results in complex distribution patterns and highly variable concentrations even among neighbouring sites of 1-3 km resolution. These results suggest that prediction models of POP distributions in the nearshore marine environment may require high-resolution validation, and highlights that the design of low resolution monitoring strategies can have profound impacts on the reliability of contaminant information or any subsequent extrapolations. This knowledge and methodology can be utilised to optimise on-going and future near-shore sediment monitoring programs both locally and in other regions around the world. Using the spatial distributions of dioxin-like contaminants within sediments, this study provided an opportunity to assess field-based relationships between habitat contamination and local marine biota contamination. Detectable levels of PCDD/Fs and dioxin-like PCBs were measured in all green, hawksbill, loggerhead and flatback marine turtle tissues. POP concentrations in sediments were found to significantly correlate with those in the herbivorous green turtle from different sediment contamination zones. These findings demonstrate that sediments represent an important secondary contaminant source and lead to redistribution of POPs to the marine food chain. POP concentrations and TEQs clearly increased from sediment to turtles as well as with increasing trophic levels in marine turtle species. The results from this study demonstrate that the extent of sediment contamination within foraging habitats governs marine turtle exposure, while, trophic status and to some extent age influence contaminant exposure within a particular contamination zone. Despite the relatively low TEQ in sediments from Moreton Bay, TEQ levels in green turtle sub-populations foraging from near-shore locations and higher trophic loggerhead and flatback turtles are similar or elevated compared to those reported for other marine wildlife from Moreton Bay and elsewhere, even compared to higher trophic species from locations impacted by dense industrial activities. High bioaccumulation potential of 2,3,7,8-PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCBs compounds were estimated for green turtles using biota to sediment accumulation factors. Selective accumulation of toxicologically more potent (i.e. lower chlorinated) PCDD/Fs was observed for higher trophic marine turtles, resulting in increasing TEQs for the carnivorous species. Biomagnification was also observed for some non-2,3,7,8-substituted dioxin congeners which typically do not accumulate in most biota. These results are proposed to be due to relatively high accumulation efficiency and/or low metabolic capacity for these POP compounds in marine turtles. These findings are also hypothesised to reflect temperature dependant, greater bioavailability of hydrophobic chemicals in sub-tropical and shallow marine systems. An additional pilot study revealed that in contrast to PCDD/Fs and PCBs, levels of persistent flame retardants (polybrominated diphenyl ethers; PBDEs) were relatively low in marine turtles and other marine species (dugong, fish and shellfish) from Moreton Bay. This suggests relatively low level input of these more recent industrial products into the marine environment. However, as elevated levels of PBDEs have been reported in blood from the general population of Australia, ongoing transport from the terrestrial to the marine system and redistribution of these contaminants, similar to PCDD/F and PCBs, would be expected to occur into the future. Limited information is available regarding the sensitivity of reptiles to and effects of POPs, however, studies have shown that reptiles are sensitive to POPs albeit with uncharacterised relative potency. In the absence of robust toxicological information for reptiles or marine turtles, the potential risks associated with PCDD/F and PCB exposure of Queensland turtle populations was evaluated using toxicity for sensitive biological endpoints observed in mammals and birds. Using probabilistic methodology for marine turtles from Queensland, the body burden of up to 31% and 55% of green and loggerhead turtles, respectively, are above the threshold levels where the most sensitive physiological effects are observed in mammals and birds. While this evaluation illustrates that the contaminants investigated have the potential to impact on the health of marine turtle populations, it must be highlighted that it is compromised by the lack of species-specific (and in this case, class-specific) information, the uncertainty of which is often considered to represent a factor of at least 10. The findings of the present study indicate that exposure to POPs has the potential to adversely affect the health of Queensland&#8217;s marine turtle populations, and highlight the need for robust information on reptile specific sensitivity to these compounds.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Persistent Organic Pollutants</field><field name="subject">PCDD/Fs</field><field name="subject">PCBs</field><field name="subject">PBDEs</field><field name="subject">contaminant</field><field name="subject">marine turtle</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">seagrass</field><field name="subject">Bioaccumulation</field><field name="subject">risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Life and Times of Alex Doucas: Migrant and Author: Searching for a new identity</field><field name="creator">Abraham Sophocleous</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis offers the first detailed critical account of the Greek-Australian writer, Alex Doucas (1900-1962) who came to Australia in 1927 as a migrant from Asia Minor. It attempts to place his work in the perspectives of Greek and Australian literatures and to evaluate his position both as a migrant and as a writer. The Asia Minor Catastrophe and the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923, as well as the Great Depression he faced in Australia along with many other Australians had a profound effect on his social outlook. Considered one of the pioneers of Greek-Australian Literature, Doucas played an important role in the development of Greek community life in Australia during the pre- and post-World War II periods. His work consists of two published novels (one posthumously) and a significant body of published and unpublished, stories, poems, translations and essays. Out of print for some decades, it remains largely unknown to the general public or even to academic circles in Greece and in Australia. It was, however, a landmark of Greek-Australian Literature and continues to have more than historical interest in its treatment of migration, exile and displacement, and in its use of intercultural perspectives to forge a positive vision for humanity. Although forced into ill-paid manual labour for much of his life after his arrival in Australia, Alex Doucas tried to develop links and relationships with Australian intellectual circles and to become involved in Australian life in the broadest way. At the same time, he never lost contact with social, political and literary developments in Greece. Alex Doucas maintained close relations with both the Greek and Australian literary traditions. As a writer he belongs to the Greek generation of the 1930s and its literary traditions. In his work, he dealt with events which took place in Anatolia before the Asia Minor Catastrophe as well as with the impact the catastrophe had on Greek society. He is one of the first writers of his generation who turned his attention to the &#8220;other side of the coin&#8221; and investigated the impact of the Catastrophe on the Turkish people. This perspective was adopted mainly due to the openness that he found in Australia, an openness that led to Multiculturalism. Alex Doucas was a multiculturalist before his time. His work is a fine example of the Australian version of Multiculturalism. Through his brother Stratis Doucas (also a writer) and others, he kept himself informed on all sorts of changes and developments in his native country, Greece, especially as it was shaped after the Asia Minor Catastrophe. At the same time, he tried to understand the Australian way of life, its culture and its literary traditions. His bi-cultural position gave him a powerful perspective. He attempted to understand the Australian way of life through his Greekness and to find answers for problematic events that happened in Greece through his Australian experience. Across the entire span of Doucas&#8217;s work, it is clear that his political philosophy and his belief in the goals of socialism played a crucial role in his consciousness of himself as a writer whose role was to provide the artistic equivalent of the philosophical basis of Marxism, best expressed in the Theses on Feuerbach (1845) by Marx, in his famous dictum, "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it". In other words, it was never enough for Doucas simply to describe in social realist terms the conditions of life and the aspirations of human beings. His aim was to show how these conditions might be changed for the better, not only for the individual, but for the community as a whole. Equally, he wished to show how people&#8217;s aspirations, particularly those of an immigrant community familiar with exile, suffering and loss, might be more fully realised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural literature, migrant literature, comparative literature, social realism, asia minor catastrophe, modern greek literature, australian literature, literary traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects of Primary Aldosteronism</field><field name="creator">Norlela Sukor</field><field name="description">Background: Primary aldosteronism (PAL) has emerged as the commonest specifically treatable and potentially curable form of secondary hypertension. With its propensity towards cardiovascular complications above that expected from hypertension alone, PAL is a potentially highly detrimental state which should be detected as early as possible in the course of the disease and treated appropriately. The detection of earlier, milder, normokalaemic forms of PAL using the aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) as a screening test has significantly enlarged the clinical spectrum of PAL and facilitated identification of a new familial variety (familial hyperaldosteronism type II, FH-II). Unlike familial hyperaldosteronism type I (FH-I), FH-II is not glucocorticoid remediable and is not caused by the CYP11B1/CYP11B2 &#8220;hybrid&#8221; gene mutation. The genetic defects underlying FH-II have not yet been elucidated and hence, detection of FH-II still involves complicated and time-consuming biochemical screening by ARR testing and confirmation by carefully performed suppression testing such as fludrocortisone suppression testing. Diagnosing PAL by currently available biochemical methods is tedious. Finding a simple and reliable genetic test for FH-II which could be applied to all members of a family with known FH-II and also to apparently sporadic PAL would simplify patient management. A genome-wide search has already demonstrated linkage of FH-II to chromosome 7p22, consistent with this locus harbouring the causative gene/s for FH-II. Three candidate genes [retinoblastoma-associated Kruppel-associated box gene (RBaK, involved in tumorigenesis and cell cycle control), postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2, involved in DNA mismatch repair and tumour predisposition) and guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-12 (GNA12, a transforming oncogene)] within this linked locus have been examined in an attempt to find the causative mutations for FH-II, but no clear causative mutations have so far been found. PAL continues to be a challenging yet rewarding disease to manage. Although much has been learnt about PAL, there are still many areas which have not been explored. PAL considered due to bilateral autonomous production of aldosterone is usually treated medically because unilateral adrenalectomy has been considered ineffective. Since medical treatment may cause adverse effects or fail to control hypertension, defining the role of unilateral adrenalectomy in bilateral PAL is an important clinical issue, but quality outcome data are lacking. The candidate therefore peformed a retrospective study of the efficacy of unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with bilateral PAL. In patients with unilateral PAL, unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy has been shown to correct hypokalaemia and lead to cure or improvement in hypertension control. While most studies have focused on clinical and biochemical outcomes, to the candidate&#8217;s knowledge, there are no data on the effects of adrenalectomy on quality of life (QOL). Assessing the QOL in patients with unilateral PAL before and after unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy (which cured hypokalaemia in all and hypertension in the majority) provided an insight into the degree to which the disease process and/or its treatment affects the life of an individual with PAL. Aims: The overall aims of this thesis were to further explore the genetic basis of FH-II, to examine the role of adrenalectomy in patients with bilateral PAL and the effects of unilateral adrenalectomy on QOL in unilateral PAL as a first step in dissecting out the effects of medical and surgical treatment on QOL in the more common bilateral PAL. In order to address the overall aims, the specific aims of the thesis were (1) to narrow the linked region at 7p22 by phenotyping and genotyping additional FH-II families from Italy, using more closely spaced microsatellite markers at 7p22, and then assess the combined multipoint logarithm of odds (LOD) score for these Italian as well as two Australian and one South American families; (2) to sequence candidate genes in the narrowed linked region for FH-II associated mutations; (3) to assess the role of unilateral adrenalectomy in bilateral PAL and identify predictive parameters; and (4) to assess the quality of life following unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with unilateral PAL. Methods and Results: Two Italian families with FH-II were genotyped using seven closely spaced microsatellite markers at 7p22. All known affected individuals from each of the two Italian families were found to share identical haplotypes for the seven markers, consistent with linkage of the disease locus with the 7p22 region. The multipoint LOD score of the now five known families with FH-II which demonstrate linkage at 7p22, calculated using MERLIN linkage analysis was highly significant at 5.22. Three candidate genes in this linked region were then examined for mutations causing FH-II; the replication protein A 3 (RPA3), zinc finger protein 12 (ZNF12) and glucocorticoid induced transcripts 1 (GLCCI1) genes were selected as they are involved in cell cycle control, and adrenal hyperplasia and adenomas are common in FH-II. Using the method of polymerase chain reaction-sequencing, coding regions, splice sites, proximal promoter, 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; untranslated regions (UTR) were sequenced in affected and unaffected subjects from the 7p22-linked FH-II families. Identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped to assess significance. For RPA3, four different SNPs were initially found to segregate with the affectation status, that is, they were present in the two affected and not the two unaffected subjects from the largest Australian family (family 1, eight affecteds) with FH-II. However, only two SNPs (rs2024374 G/C and rs17169194 T/G) were further genotyped as that they were in functionally important positions of the gene (that is, in regulatory regions within the promoter and 5&#8217; UTR) and because of the relatively low allele frequency reported in the literature for these two SNPs in controls. Further genotyping of these SNPs was carried out in another six affecteds and four unaffecteds from the same family and a complete segregation of these two SNPs with affectation status was seen in family 1. The G/C mutation rs2024374 in the RPA3 promoter results in the loss of three transcription factor binding sites and creation of one new site. The factors for which the binding sites in the RPA3 promoter and 5&#8217;UTR were altered by these two SNPs were involved in regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Hence, it is possible that altered activity of the RPA3 promoter and 5&#8217;UTR in family 1 could result in predisposition to adrenal hyperplasia or neoplasia, altered ARR and/or hypertension. Genotyping of these SNPs was then carried out in another two pedigrees (families 2 and 3) that showed linkage to 7p22, and in 75 normotensive, non-PAL control subjects. However, neither of these two SNPs segregated with the affectation status in family 2 and 3, and they were present in 30% and 20% of controls, respectively. For ZNF12 and GLCCI1, no evidence of causative mutations was found in the coding regions, splice sites, proximal promoter region and proximal 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; UTR. Between 1984 and 2004, 51 of 684 patients diagnosed with bilateral PAL underwent unilateral adrenalectomy. Forty patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were followed for at least 12 (median 56.4) months. Hypertension was cured in 15% and improved in 20%, usually within one year of unilateral adrenalectomy. The proportion with controlled hypertension was significantly (p&lt;0.001) higher after adrenalectomy (65%) than before (25%). Mean systolic (p&lt;0.001) and diastolic (p&lt;0.001) blood pressure, left ventricular mass index (p&lt;0.05) and aldosterone/renin ratio (p&lt;0.001) fell. Serum creatinine independently predicted hypertension cure. From 2007 through 2008, QOL was evaluated prospectively using the internationally validated SF-36 questionnaire before and 3 and 6 months post-operatively in 22 patients [14 males, 8 females; mean age 50.0 &#177; 2.0 (range 27-69) years] with unilateral PAL who underwent adrenalectomy within the Endocrine Hypertension Centre, Greenslopes and Princess Alexandra Hospitals. Pre-operatively, the SF36 score for each QOL domain was lower for PAL patients than reported for the Australian general population, significantly so for physical functioning (p&lt;0.05), role physical (p&lt;0.001), vitality (p&lt;0.001) and general health (p&lt;0.05). Compared with pre-adrenalectomy, there were significant increments in mean scores at 3 months for physical functioning (p&lt;0.05), role physical (p&lt;0.05), general health (p&lt;0.001), role emotional (p&lt;0.05), social functioning (p&lt;0.05), mental health (p&lt;0.001) and vitality (p&lt;0.001); and at 6 months for physical functioning (p&lt;0.05), role physical (p&lt;0.05), general health (p&lt;0.05), role emotional (p&lt;0.05), mental health (p&lt;0.05) and vitality (p&lt;0.001). Mean SBP and DBP improved significantly (p&lt;0.001), with 86% of these patients cured (BP&#8804;140/90, no drugs) and the remaining 14 % improved. Mean plasma potassium (p&lt;0.001) and renin concentration rose (p&lt;0.01), whereas mean upright plasma aldosterone (p&lt;0.001), aldosterone/renin ratio (p&lt;0.001) and number of antihypertensive agents fell (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: In the Italian families with FH-II available for study, work by the candidate included in this thesis confirmed linkage of FH-II to chromosome 7p22. The combined multipoint LOD score of 5.22 for the five families showing linkage at 7p22 was highly significant. Linkage to 7p22 in Italian families with FH-II extends the previous positive findings to a third geographical area, bringing greater certainty regarding the importance of this locus in identifying causative mutations. Although no clear causative mutations were found in the three 7p22 candidate genes examined, it is conceivable that the rs2024374 G/C and/or rs17169194 T/G SNPs in RPA3 could act in conjunction with another 7p22 mutation in family 1, resulting in the FH-II phenotype. Examination of the outcome of unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with bilateral PAL suggests that this surgical approach can be beneficial in certain carefully selected patients and should not be automatically excluded as a treatment option. Unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with unilateral PAL has positive impacts not only on clinical and biochemical parameters but also on QOL. The findings of this thesis provide new insights into the genetic basis and therapeutic options and treatment outcomes of PAL and further highlight its importance as a common, genetically based, specifically treatable and potentially curable cause of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. It also points the way to potentially very useful studies in future by exploring longer term effects of unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy as treatment for PAL on QOL, to compare unilateral adrenalectomy in those with unilateral versus bilateral PAL, and to compare surgery with specific medical treatment.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Primary aldosteronism, hyperaldosteronism, aldosterone/renin ratio, fludrocortisone suppression test, adrenal venous sampling, genetics, linkage, chromosome 7, 7p22 candidate genes, familial hyperaldosteronism type I, familial hyperaldosteronism type II,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paediatric oncology videotelephone support in Queensland: an investigation of feasibility and cost-effectiveness</field><field name="creator">Mark Eliot Bensink</field><field name="description">Introduction The Queensland Children&#8217;s Cancer Centre (QCCC) of the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital (RCH) in Brisbane, cares for children and family members from across the state covering over of 1.7 million km2 and a population of more than 3.6 million inhabitants. Around sixty percent of families accessing QCCC services live outside the Brisbane metropolitan area at distances ranging from hundreds to thousands of kilometres away. Telephone communication is used to provide specialist care and support to families directly to the home. Telephone communication is also used by families to maintain intra-family psychosocial care and support during treatment related separation. Although the feasibility of using online support mechanisms such as videotelephony (full-duplex, real-time audiovisual communication) has been investigated in a number of areas, no investigations have been reported in the area of paediatric oncology care and support. Scope Initial investigations focused on paediatric oncology related palliative care, a subgroup of paediatric oncology families with high care and support needs. Following continued difficulties with family recruitment in the area of palliative care, two additional areas where support via videotelephone may be of benefit were identified by clinicians: facilitation of intra-family support during paediatric related inpatient admission and new diagnosis discharge support. Investigations were expanded to include these areas. Methods Two custom made videotelephone units were developed to provide audio-visual communication using the ordinary home telephone line for early investigations. Improvements in the mechanism to provide video to the home were evaluated throughout investigations (in terms of technical feasibility and cost) moving from dedicated dial-up systems to use of the families existing home computer and broadband Internet connectivity. Feasibility studies were completed with one or more patients/families to confirm that videotelephony could be used successfully within the given area of paediatric oncology. To investigate cost-effectiveness, studies were designed to evaluate the cost and the effect of videotelephony support. The primary measure of clinical effectiveness was parental mental-health related quality of life. For analysis of cost-effectiveness, parental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were used to investigate the incremental cost per QALY. Results The feasibility of providing videotelephone based support was confirmed in paediatric oncology related palliative care with a single family. Despite a number of attempts, a randomised controlled trial with palliative care families was terminated prematurely after continuing problems with recruitment. Based on the experience in this trial, the acceptability of providing support to paediatric oncology related palliative care families using videotelephony was then evaluated. All families were offered videotelephony as part of the routine services provided by the QCCC over a 12-month period. Consent to participate was taken as a proxy measure of acceptability. Consent from 92% of families offered the service provided some reassurance that videotelephone based support was acceptable to these families. The average cost of the service, including fixed equipment and infrastructure costs, was $3,830 per family with a variable cost of $66 per family. Feasibility was also confirmed for the facilitation of intra-family support during inpatient admission, again with a single bone marrow transplant family. A small (n=16) randomised controlled study was then completed in the area of intra-family support with paediatric bone marrow transplant families. Preliminary evidence of effectiveness was obtained with improved mental health related quality of life of parents with a mean improvement of 6.3 points using the Mental Component Summary Score (MCS-12) of the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form (SF-12) (95% CI: 0.6 to 12.0, p=0.030). No effect was seen for patients or siblings. On an intention-to-treat basis the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) using univariate analysis was $12,757/QALY (Fieller&#8217;s 95% CI: $6,792 to $64,548) with a 92.5% probability that supplemental videotelephone support was cost-effective compared to standard support mechanisms alone at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $30,000/QALY. ICER results using multivariable analysis were $26,623 (Fieller&#8217;s 95% CI: $10,475 to 177,921) and probability of 58.0% at the same willingness to pay threshold. Despite some uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention, preliminary results support the appropriateness of further investigations in this area. For the final area of investigation, new diagnosis discharge support, a pilot trial (n=8) was completed which confirmed the feasibility of providing videotelephone based support at this time in the treatment pathway. In addition, a cost-minimisation analysis was completed to evaluate the cost of providing real-time audio-visual communication to the home using a newly developed videotelephone alternative (a webcam and software used on the family home PC and Internet connection) rather than the custom made videotelephone units initially developed. With an average cost of $294 per family for the home computer option versus $1,345 for the original custom made videotelephone option, the economic benefits of the newly developed alternative were confirmed. Conclusion Feasibility has been confirmed in all three areas investigated, paediatric oncology related palliative care, intra-family support and discharge support. For the facilitation of intra-family support during inpatient admission, preliminary evidence indicates that the addition of videotelephony support, as a supplement to standard support mechanisms, may be cost-effective. Based on this result, further research in this area appears justifiable. It is also feasible to conduct a larger trial in the area of discharge support which should provide important information on the cost-effectiveness of videotelephony services provided at this time. The results of these investigations, combined with an increased understanding and insight into the role videotelephone support can play in paediatric oncology, provide the basis for the development of a potentially cost-effective model for improving the care and support provided by children&#8217;s cancer services in Australia using videotelephony. This model spans the spectrum of paediatric oncology care from diagnosis, through outpatient care, to discharge home (either for palliative care or remission care) specifically with geographically dispersed populations in mind. To provide further evidence of cost-effectiveness in paediatric oncology more broadly, future research will need to focus initially on three areas. The first area is preliminary investigations, this essentially includes consideration of the potential economic impact of proposed services before investment in further research and development. For paediatric oncology videotelephone support preliminary research includes the potential for videotelephony in paediatric oncology outpatient care, specifically the number of consultations that could potentially be replaced and the associated economic implications. Preliminary investigations will also need to include quantification of the burden of out-of-pocket telecommunications expenses for paediatric oncology families of the QCCC and the potential economic implications of supplemental videotelephone intra-family support extended beyond paediatric bone marrow transplant families. The second area is clinical feasibility including studies into the practical inclusion of videotelephony support in existing out-patient workloads and workflows, alternative models to provide videotelephony support and inclusion of videotelephony as part of palliative bereavement care and support. Finally, the completion of large, well-designed randomised controlled trials will be required to provide evidence of the cost-effectiveness of videotelephony support in paediatric oncology. The investigations presented in this thesis form the foundation for this work and its application to the delivery of health services to the home in a variety of contexts nationally and internationally.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">paedaitric</field><field name="subject">oncology</field><field name="subject">health services</field><field name="subject">videotelephony</field><field name="subject">cost-effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust, Regulation and Mining Corporations</field><field name="creator">Petrina Schiavi</field><field name="description">The social and environmental impacts of mining, especially in the case of large mining developments, can be dramatic and irreversible. From a regulatory perspective, the impacts of mining present a range of challenges, at both global and local levels. In recent years, however, many large, globalised mining corporations have been attempting to demonstrate that they can be trusted to adequately address the potential social and environmental impacts of their activities. This has lead some mining corporations to engage in certain behaviours that may be further leveraged to help to steer them towards improved social and environmental outcomes. This research explores the reasons why some mining corporations want to be trusted, how they believe trust can be built, the kinds of activities they are undertaking in order to build trust, and the implications of this for regulation and governance. Sociological perspectives on trust are employed as a theoretical foundation to analyse the significance of trust to large mining corporations in the context of their social and environmental performance, and the consequences of this for corporate regulation. Using a qualitative methodology, data was collected through participant observation, relevant industry documentation, and interviews with mining executives, non-government organisations, regulators and other key players in the mining industry. This data provides an insight into the dynamics of trust, regulation and corporate behaviour from the perspective of the mining industry and its stakeholders. The research finds that trust does play a significant role in corporate behaviour, and in regulatory dynamics. Further, many corporate trust-building efforts were found to have resulted in some level of improved social and environmental performance, at least at the level of systems, procedures and corporate rhetoric. Such findings around corporate trust-building and resultant corporate behaviour have implications for regulatory strategy in that it helps to explain why and how corporate trustworthiness may be targeted by regulators in order to achieve improved regulatory outcomes. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on trust and regulation in the fields of sociology and regulatory studies, and has practical application in terms of regulatory strategy. It also offers a platform for further studies into how trust might be more effectively harnessed in terms of regulatory strategy in the mining industry and across other industry sectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">mining corporations</field><field name="subject">regulation</field><field name="subject">governance</field><field name="subject">corporate social performance</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">extractive industries</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health aspects of wine antioxidants: Composition and in vitro bioavailability</field><field name="creator">Irine Ginjom</field><field name="description">The antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds in red wine is suggested to be responsible for their health-promoting effects. Compared to other wines, little information is available on phenolic compositions and antioxidant capacity of Australian wine. Information related to the fate of these phenolics in the body once consumed is also very limited. The overall aim of this research was to investigate the relevance of red wine consumption as a source of health-giving antioxidants in humans. The phenolic composition of wine was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu (total phenolic), aluminium chloride (total flavonols), methyl cellulose precipitation (MCP) (total tannins), pH differential (total monomeric anthocyanins), bisulfite bleaching (total polymeric anthocyanin fractions), and liquid chromatographic (LC-MS) (individual phenolics) methods. Antioxidant activities were measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2&#8217;-azino-bis-93-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays. The phenolic and antioxidant data were then used to establish the relationship between these two parameters in wines from different varieties (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) and winemaking stages (crushing, fermentations, oaking and bottling). By using an in vitro digestion model that mimics the upper gastrointestinal tract (GIT) digestion, the stability of the wine phenolics during digestion was examined. Finally, to gain a better understanding of the post-digestion absorption of wine phenolics, their permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers was evaluated. A total of 8 monomeric anthocyanins and 17 other phenolic compounds were positively identified in the red wines using LC-MS analysis. Most of the phenolic categories showed some positive correlations with the antioxidant activities but none of the individual phenolic compounds showed a strong correlation with the total antioxidant activity of the wine, implying a combined contribution of many wine phenolics to antioxidant effects. The phenolic compositions and antioxidant activities of three of Australia&#8217;s most common red wines varieties - Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot were not different from each other, possibly due to the variability within each grape cultivar. During the winemaking process, the total phenolic content and the associated antioxidant activity of the wine increased during the fermentation process, as more phenolics are being extracted from grape skin, seeds and stems into the wine. During oak and bottle ageing, the total phenolic contents were stabilised. Most of the wine phenolics were more stable under acidic conditions (pH 2 and 5.5) than neutral or alkaline conditions (pH 7.4 and 9). This may partly explain the stability of the wine phenolics subjected to the acidic (pH 2) gastric digestion and their loss following simulated pancreatic digestion (pH 7.4). In addition, sample pre-treatment procedures prior to LC-MS analysis may have removed some antioxidants in the form of degradation products and/or new polymeric compounds following the in vitro gastric and pancreatic digestion processes. The missing products appeared to be detected by both the Folin-Ciocalteu method and ORAC assay, which measured the phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity, after the pancreatic digestion. This suggests that the instability of phenolic compounds at pH 7.4, results in the transformation of most of the oral phenolic antioxidants into more stable forms in the GIT, which in turn contribute positively to the overall antioxidant activities of the ingested wine. All of the original wine phenolics had very low permeabilities across Caco-2 cell monolayers, except for syringic acid, p-coumaric acid and an unknown phenolic acid. Limited surface area for absorption (0.33 cm2) and the limited peak detection sensitivity in the LC method may have contributed towards the difficulty in detecting and identifying compounds with low permeability. In addition, extensive metabolism of absorbed phenolics by the Caco-2 cells may occur based on the appearance of several new peaks. However, due to their low concentrations and lack of reference, the identities of the new products and metabolites remain unknown. The present in vitro study suggests that upon ingestion, most of the original phenolic compounds in red wine are lost either through degradation to new compounds and/or complexation with other compounds. However, these products seem to possess some antioxidant activity and may be the key compounds responsible for the health-promoting effects of red wine. The limitation of the present study in detecting and fully identifying these breakdown products and metabolites should be addressed in future studies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">red wine</field><field name="subject">winemaking</field><field name="subject">phenolics</field><field name="subject">anthocyanins</field><field name="subject">antioxidants</field><field name="subject">LC-MS</field><field name="subject">in vitro bioavailability</field><field name="subject">digestion</field><field name="subject">Caco-2 monolayer cells</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergency Control Power System Separation</field><field name="creator">Victer Chin</field><field name="description">Power systems in many countries are stressed towards their stability limit. If these stable systems experience any unexpected contingencies, or disturbances, there is a significant risk of instability, which may lead to wide-spread blackout. Existing methods to minimize the risk of stability and excessive frequency decline; need to be redeveloped to address these new challenges. This research project will develop a new emergency control methodology, which can more effectively prevent power system frequency and voltage instability under emergency conditions. Frequency and voltage instability are two major concerns in power system operation. The primary aim of this project is to develop new optimal load shedding techniques, which are able to better address various voltage and frequency instability issues for power systems emergency control purpose. In this thesis, new approach of load shedding for frequency and voltage stability are presented. For the load shedding to prevent frequency collapse, System Frequency Respond &#8211; Under Frequency Load Shedding (SFR-UFLS) from the previous approach has been redeveloped to compute an optimal load shedding scheme. The limitation of previous optimal load shed method is that they only shed load following one particular contingency event. As an improvement of this method, we developed a technique that protects against a range of contingencies. For the load shedding to prevent voltage collapse, The proposed method is then tested on the 39-bus New England test system. Generators are of different importance to the system in terms of voltage stability. It is essential to investigate generators&#8217; impact on system voltage stability. The theory of the normal forms of diffeomorphism is used to analyze the power flow equations, and then nonlinear active participation factor is obtained and is used to determine the influence of generators on voltage stability. By using this method, the nonlinearity of power systems can be taken into consideration while the computational efficiency is maintained. Therefore, the impact of generators can be measured with more accuracy even for the cases in which the system is characterized with strong nonlinearity. In order to show the validity of the proposed method, the IEEE 14-bus test system and the New England 39-bus power system are used as case studies. The steady-state voltage stability index verifies the proposed method. The results show that nonlinear active participation factor can describe the characteristics even when power systems are operating at a highly stressed condition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">Under Frequency Load Sheeding (UFLS)</field><field name="subject">Systerm Frequency Response (SFR) model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial modelling for the conservation of threatened species: distributions, habitats and landscape connectivity of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata).</field><field name="creator">Justine Murray</field><field name="description">Ecological patterns and processes influence ecosystem function at scales from nanometres to global scales depending on the organisms involved. Predicting the presence and abundance of species, at scales appropriate to the organisms and the underlying processes, is central to ecology. Models of species&#8217; distributions can provide important insights into pattern-process-scale relationships including the relative importance of various environmental factors and their interactions that influence habitat selection at the individual and population levels. Mapping current and potential distributions informs the conservation of threatened species by providing spatial information on where a species is likely to occur and the identification of habitat elements and their spatial configurations which influence occupancy and persistence. The aim of this thesis was to incorporate the principles of pattern, process and scale in the identification of habitat associations for threatened species within a species&#8217; distribution modelling framework. Accurate modelling of species&#8217; distributions depends on robust sampling designs, reliable data input and appropriate statistical methodologies that align with the ecological model. I applied a range of innovative statistical methods to various sources of data to identify important habitat associations for a threatened species at different scales and tested the discriminative ability of the resultant models. I integrated the results from extensive field sampling and expert elicitation to build connectivity networks using graph theory algorithms to identify important conservation priorities for threatened species. The threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) was chosen as a suitable study species for quantifying habitat relationships at multiple spatial scales using species&#8217; distribution modelling. The distribution of brush-tailed rock-wallabies is restricted to a set of suitable habitat characteristics related to rocky terrain supporting cliffs and boulder piles that occur infrequently across a landscape. At the site scale, they require suitable resting and refuge sites provided by rocky habitats, while at a landscape scale their dispersal is dependent on the connectivity of suitable habitats. The species is listed as threatened throughout eastern Australia and endangered in some states. Information about its current distribution and occupancy status is essential to support habitat conservation and threat management. The first chapter provides a broad view of the literature on modelling of species&#8217; distributions and the thesis aims and structure. In chapter 2, I assess the ecological scale relevant to habitat modelling for the brush-tailed rock-wallaby. In chapter 3 I test whether habitat models from one region can be extrapolated to neighbouring regions. I use a novel approach and elicitation tool in chapter 4 to collect expert knowledge and assess it with a comprehensive set of field data in a Bayesian framework. In chapter 5 I assess whether landscape connectivity is a determinant of site occupancy by using graph theory algorithms to identify important habitat patches and dispersal pathways for rock-wallaby movement in fragmented landscapes. The final chapter synthesises the individual chapters&#8217; findings within the context of species&#8217; distribution modelling. Management implications are discussed for the conservation of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby and its habitat network. Wider implications are also suggested for other rock-wallaby species and species living in similar environments. The results of the thesis showed the habitat of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby was affected by site-scale and landscape-scale factors, supporting the need for a multi-scale approach when investigating species-environment associations. I found that models performed well within a region at both scales. Extrapolating the models to neighbouring regions resulted in good predictive performance at the site scale but substantially poorer predictive performance at the landscape scale. When there is insufficient field data to build robust data models, management bodies would benefit from incorporating expert knowledge. The study demonstrates the potential errors in using experts with knowledge gained from outside the area of interest. Finally, I highlight the importance of accounting for the landscape connectivity between patches from the perspective of the individual animal. Least cost analysis, using graph theory algorithms, provides a cost-efficient and effective framework for identifying landscape connectivity patterns and key paths and patches to help inform suitable land management strategies for conservation of threatened species. There is much pressure from conservation and management agencies to produce models of species&#8217; distributions that could be potentially be used in other regions or with similar species. The thesis combines ecological theory with rigorous statistical methodology to test different modelling techniques for species distribution modelling. It demonstrates how a combination of expert knowledge, extensive field data and landscape connectivity measures successfully predicts ecological relationships at a number of scales. Species&#8217; distribution models can benefit from applying a robust sampling design and suitable modelling techniques to various data sources to generate ecologically-based information to improve our understanding of species-habitat associations and provide a reliable component to incorporate into conservation planning. This thesis therefore provides important advances to spatial ecology and ecological modelling of species distributions and management of threatened species.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">species distribution models</field><field name="subject">brush-tailed rock wallaby</field><field name="subject">expert elicitation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex Determination and Sex Ratio Manipulation in Beef Cattle</field><field name="creator">Diana Gabriella Farkas Ross</field><field name="description">Abstract Biotechnological strategies aimed at producing male-only offspring have the potential to improve the yield of the Australian beef industry. As a proof-of-concept project, I aimed to target the primary male sex-determining gene Sry to the X chromosome in mice, to produce a transgenic XY male that would transmit Sry &#8211; and hence maleness &#8211; to both XX and XY offspring. In this project I aimed to target a 14.5 kb DNA fragment containing Sry to an X-chromosome locus that escapes X-inactivation. After considering many potential loci, a targeting strategy and construct were designed for the SMCX locus, which is well conserved between mouse, human and bovine. A targeting vector with 5kb and 3kb arms of homology was also constructed without Sry, to target the locus. Attempts to introduce the 14.5 kb Sry fragment into the construct were unsuccessful, and a smaller construct, containing only the coding sequence of the Sry gene driven by a strong promoter, is currently being made. In order to translate this transgenic approach into cattle, other facets of bovine sex determination required investigation. First, it was important to identify the necessary regulatory regions upstream of bovine SRY needed for the gene to be functional, and secondly to investigate the timing of testis development in male bovine embryos. To enable sequence comparison, I sequenced upstream of the bovine and goat SRY gene and through bioinformatic analysis identified regulatory regions common to several mammals. I identified four regions of high homology upstream of bovine SRY conserved between human, goat, and pig, but not mouse. These regions are likely to be important for the regulation of the gene in these species, as they share unique transcription factor binding sites. From this research I concluded that 9 kb upstream of bovine SRY were likely to be useful in transgenic strategies to produce sex-reversed cattle. Although I attempted to use a 15 kb bovine genomic fragment containing SRY to sex reverse XX mice, this project was unsuccessful. I also investigated the expression pattern of genes known to have a role in sex determination, including SRY, in early bovine embryos. I identified the major time points important for male sex determination, including the first appearance of the gonadal ridge from the mesonephros at day 31, the onset of SRY expression and its peak at day 39, and the appearance of testis cords at day 42, along with the pattern of expression of many other genes downstream of SRY. This information will allow future researchers to check that transgenic SRY expression is occurring at the correct time and place for it to be able to cause XX sex reversal in cattle. I also identified some of the major time points important for female sex determination, including that ovigerous cords form between CRL 37-91 in female bovine embryos. In addition I show the cellular differentiation of the cortex and medulla at this time. I have also predicted the female germ cell entry into meiosis around CRL 40 in bovine embryos through the use of qRT-PCR for STRA8 and SYCP3. This is the first detailed account of gene expression profiles in early female bovine embryos, unfortunately the data is incomplete due to an uneven distribution of embryo ages due to the difficulty of obtaining embryos from timed matings. Hopefully in the future obtaining more female embryos of the missing stages can complete the female data. This project has provided additional basic knowledge about bovine sex-determination events to ensure the possibility of making single-sex livestock a real possibility in the future. The similarity between human and bovine developmental time frames also points to cattle being a good alternative model for human development, and emphasises the need for further research in species other than mouse, with the aim of ultimately understanding our own biology.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">embryo</field><field name="subject">genital ridge</field><field name="subject">gonad</field><field name="subject">sex determination</field><field name="subject">SRY</field><field name="subject">testis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising Crim1 in Vertebrate Development</field><field name="creator">Genevieve Kinna</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the role of Crim1, a transmembrane protein that is expressed in a number of areas in the vertebrate embryo including the developing kidney, eye, testis and spinal cord, which we believe may be a regulator of vertebrate tissue development. To dissect the function of Crim1 in normal mammalian development, two vertebrate models were used, zebrafish and mice. The results show that in zebrafish, crim1 is expressed early in development from the 16-cell stage through to 30 hours post fertilisation (Chapter 3). At 24 hours post fertilisation crim1 is expressed in the intermediate cell mass (icm), the site of haemangioblast development. Haemangioblasts are precursor cells that contribute to the formation of the blood and endothelial cell lineages. Injection of crim1 antisense oligonucleotides into zebrafish embryos (crim1 morphants) lead to an expansion of the icm and defects in the trunk, tail, somites and vasculature. The injection of crim1 antisense oligonucleotides into transgenic fli:GFP zebrafish revealed defects in the intersegmental, dorsal longitudinal anastomotic and parachordal vessels. Although crim1 is expressed during haemagiogensis the primary defect in the crim1 morphant zebrafish appears to be vascular. Further experiments used a &#8216;knock-in&#8217; mouse, Crim1KST264, in which a loss of functional Crim1 leads to defects in limb (syndactyly), skeleton, eye, vascular, kidney and placental development. Analysis of the kidney phenotype in the embryonic Crim1KST264 homozygotes showed that a loss of Crim1 affects ERK1/2 and phosphorylated-Smad1/5/8 protein expression, although has no direct effect on BMP or TGF&#946; protein expression (Chapter 4). Analysis of the adult Crim1 outbred kidneys revealed they have albuminuria and leaky vasculature. The complex phenotype presented by the Crim1KST264 homozygote kidneys suggests Crim1 may be regulating multiple growth factor pathways. As Crim1 was shown to be expressed in the placenta, we characterised the role of Crim1 in placental development using the Crim1KST264 mouse (Chapter 5). Crim1KST264 homozygote placentas and embryos are smaller than their wild-type littermates. Our investigations revealed that Crim1 is expressed in trophoblast giant cells and in spongiotrophoblasts. A loss of Crim1 causes a developmental defect in that the junctional zone (region of the placenta containing spongiotrophoblasts and glycogen cells) is expanded, although this phenotype does not appear to be due to a defect in proliferation or apoptosis. Further analysis of E15.5 Crim1KST264 homozygote placentas revealed there was a reduction in the number of labyrinth trophoblast gaint cells. Thus, by using zebrafish and mouse as two model organisms of vertebrate development, this thesis has showed that Crim1 is clearly important for normal embryonic development. To dissect the complex phenotype presented by the Crim1KST264 mouse, further studies of Crim1 and its interaction with other growth factor pathways is needed to elucidate how and to what extent they interact with Crim1 to determine its biological effect on vertebrate tissue.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crim1</field><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">hemangioblast</field><field name="subject">intermediate cell mass</field><field name="subject">kidney</field><field name="subject">placenta</field><field name="subject">trophoblast giant cell</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188282</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pesticides in the Great Barrier Reef: Monitoring Tools</field><field name="creator">Melanie Shaw</field><field name="description">Pesticide runoff from agricultural applications poses a potential threat to water quality in the world heritage listed Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and sensitive monitoring tools are needed to facilitate effective monitoring of these pollutants. This thesis has worked to advance passive sampling tools for monitoring trace organic pollutants and their potential impacts on the GBR. The suitability of several available passive sampling tools for detecting trace concentrations of target pesticide analytes was investigated in a laboratory calibration chamber before experiments were conducted to further understanding of the response of Chemcatcher passive samplers in environmental conditions likely to be experienced in the GBR. Passive samplers were deployed in a survey of pesticides in the GBR environment and extracts were applied in bioassays to investigate their application for predicting mixture toxicity to GBR biota. When employed and interpreted appropriately, passive sampling tools have been shown to provide for sensitive and reproducible detection of organic pollutants in relatively pristine environments. While considerable research has been conducted into the performance and theory of analyte uptake by a range of passive sampling devices, several key knowledge gaps existed and were addressed in this study. The applicability of the performance reference compound (PRC) concept as an in situ calibration method for passive samplers using Empore Disk sampling phases (Chemcatchers) to monitor polar compounds was investigated. This experiment showed that while uptake of pesticides was linear and reproducible, PRC loss was not linear, meaning that the dissipation rates of these PRCs cannot be used to estimate the effect of field exposure conditions on uptake rates. An alternative in situ calibration technique using PRC loaded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) disks deployed alongside the Chemcatchers as a surrogate calibration phase has been tested and shows promise for future applications. Pesticide concentrations in waters flowing to the GBR have been shown to undergo dramatic fluctuations over short time periods and the potential for these conditions to limit the integrative period of sampling was investigated by simulating a changing concentration event in a calibration chamber. The ability for samplers to predict average concentrations was dependant on the deployment configuration (with or without membrane) used and the period of deployment relative to the changing concentration event. Passive samplers were employed in a survey of pesticides in GBR waters during a wet and dry season at river mouths, two nearshore regions and an offshore region. The nearshore marine environment was shown to be contaminated with pesticides in both the dry and wet seasons (average water concentrations of 1.3-3.8 ng L-1 and 2.2-6.4 ng L-1, respectively), while no pesticides were detected further offshore. Continuous monitoring of two rivers over 13 months showed waters flowing to the GBR were contaminated with herbicides (diuron, atrazine, hexazinone) year round, with highest average concentrations present during summer months (350 ng L-1). The use of passive samplers has enabled identification of insecticides in GBR waters which have not been reported in the literature previously. Extracts from passive samplers deployed at three sites in the GBR were applied to bioassays targeting integral life stages or functions of coral reef biota: scleractinian coral larvae, sea urchin larvae, a marine diatom and marine bacteria. The results demonstrate the utility of pairing passive sampling with bioassays and reveal that mixtures of organic pollutants in the GBR have the potential to cause detrimental effects to coral reef biota. This research outlines an approach that reduces one of the levels of simplification of risk assessment of pollutants to ecosystems by incorporating mixtures of chemicals present in the environment. The use of passive sampler extracts in toxicity testing allows pollutant mixtures to be assessed at a range of enrichment factors and, with the inclusion of biota from the ecosystem of concern, improves the relevance of results for predicting real world effects. The findings of this thesis are intended to be used to improve the application of passive sampling tools for routine monitoring to provide managers with understanding of the pesticides present, the potential effects of those pollutant mixtures and feedback on the efficacy of implemented land management practices in halting and reversing the impacts of pesticides on the GBR.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water quality</field><field name="subject">passive sampler</field><field name="subject">empore</field><field name="subject">chemcatcher</field><field name="subject">semipermeable membrane device</field><field name="subject">calibration</field><field name="subject">agriculture</field><field name="subject">toxicity</field><field name="subject">coral</field><field name="subject">reef</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painful diabetic neuropathy: preclinical studies to improve therapeutic insight.</field><field name="creator">Kathleen Otto</field><field name="description">My PhD research studies, described in this thesis, were designed to document the temporal development of mechanical allodynia, a hallmark symptom of painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN), as well as opioid hyposensitivity using two different rat models of diabetes mellitus (DM). Specifically, the studies were conducted using the streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rat model of chemically-induced Type 1 diabetes in two different rat strains, as well as the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat genetic model of Type 2 diabetes. Additionally, a longitudinal investigation of the effect of basal insulin replacement therapy to restore euglycaemia from 7-days post-STZ administration, on the development of mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws of the STZ-diabetic Wistar rat model of PDN, was conducted. The studies herein also included a longitudinal study to document the temporal development of mechanical allodynia and opioid hyposensitivity in the ZDF rat, which also examined the influence of dietary composition on the time course for the development of mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws, together with opioid hyposensitivity in these animals. In the final section of this thesis, the experiments were designed to examine possible mechanisms that may contribute to the development of opioid hyposensitivity in ZDF diabetic rats. These experiments involved the quantification of opioid receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression as well as &#956;-opioid receptor (MOP-r) functional responses in tissues collected from 29-wk old diabetic ZDF rats relative to 7-wk old pre-diabetic control ZDF animals. In Chapter One, diabetes mellitus and more specifically its longterm complication, PDN, the focus of this doctoral research program, has been reviewed. Specifically, possible pathogenic mechanisms underlying mechanical allodynia, the relevant diabetic rodent models of PDN, use of insulin replacement therapy in diabetic rodents and its impact on hallmark symptoms of PDN, role of opioid pharmacology, the comparative efficacy of opioids in the treatment of PDN, and possible mechanisms that may underpin the development of opioid hyposensitivity in PDN, including the impact of altered excitatory neurotransmitters, have been reviewed. In Chapter Two, a preliminary study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of 4-wks treatment with Linplants (subcutaneous (s.c.) sustained-release bovine insulin implants) alone and in combination with ActRapid&#174; (s.c. human insulin; 0.05 U to 3.5 U/100 g/day) with respect to glycaemic control in STZ-diabetic Wistar rats, and on acute diabetes characteristics for a 5-wk post-STZ administration period. Briefly, STZ-diabetic rats were divided into three groups: (1) rats which received no insulin treatment, (2) rats which were implanted with one s.c. Linplant at Day 7 post-STZ administration, and (3) rats which received one s.c. Linplant plus a once-daily injection of ActRapid&#174; once diabetes was confirmed at 7-days post-STZ administration. The findings were that following implantation of a single Linplant at Day 7 post-STZ administration, euglycaemia was achieved in 50% of STZ-diabetic rats, with glycaemic control maintained for up to 4-wks post-implantation. Furthermore, once-daily injection of ActRapid&#8482; to animals whose blood glucose levels (BGLs) were not well-controlled through use of Linplants alone, failed to achieve euglycaemia. It is possible that the ActRapid&#8482; doses administered were not sufficient to achieve euglycaemia, and that increasing the doses may provide more effective glycaemic control. However, doubling the mean ActRapid&#8482; dose from 1.63 (+ 0.3) U administered at Day 28 to 2.56 (+ 0.6) U administered at Day 34 post-STZ administration effectively only reduced BGLs by 1.3 mM to 11.6 + 1.6 mM. This suggests that although administering additional large doses of ActRapid&#8482; to STZ-diabetic rats may eventually achieve euglycaemia, this method would presumably not be a more efficient method in achieving euglycaemia compared with the use of dosage-adjustable s.c. Linplants. Group (1) STZ-diabetic rats which were not treated with insulin developed diabetic signs including polydipsia, hyperphagia, decreased rate of body weight gain, and mechanical allodynia. Group (2) rats in which insulin treatment from 7-days post-STZ administration restored euglycaemia and reversed polydipsia and hyperphagia, were protected against the development of mechanical allodynia and reduced weight gain for the 5-wk study duration, while rats from Group (3) with incomplete glycaemic control developed levels of polydipsia, hyperphagia, reduced weight gain and mechanical allodynia intermediate between rats in Groups (1) and (2). These findings collectively suggest a direct correlation between the level of glycaemic control and the extent to which mechanical allodynia, a defining symptom of PDN, develops. In Chapter Three, the findings from the preliminary 5-wk study in Chapter Two were used to design a 24-wk longitudinal study of the temporal development of mechanical allodynia and opioid hyposensitivity in STZ-diabetic Wistar rats for comparison with the findings of a similar study previously undertaken by our laboratory using STZ-diabetic Dark Agouti rats (Nielsen et al, 2007). Additionally, this study examined the effects of tight glycaemic control achieved through the use of insulin implants as a means of potentially preventing the development of mechanical allodynia and opioid hyposensitivity for up to 24 weeks in STZ-diabetic Wistar rats. Briefly, STZ-diabetic rats were divided into 3 groups: (1) non-insulin treated STZ-diabetic Dark Agouti rats to provide comparison data with our laboratory&#8217;s previously published data in this rat strain (Nielsen et al, 2007), (2) non-insulin treated STZ-diabetic Wistar rats to examine possible between-species differences, and (3) STZ-diabetic Wistar rats which were treated with adjustable-dose s.c. Linplants from Day 7 post-STZ administration to maintain euglycaemia for the remainder of the 24-wk study period. In this 24-wk longitudinal study in STZ-diabetic rats, body weight, 24-hr water intake, paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) and BGLs were monitored at fortnightly intervals in all animals in order to document possible temporal changes in the development of diabetic signs and mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws respectively. STZ-diabetic rats underwent 6-wkly opioid antinociceptive testing, using single bolus doses of each of morphine and oxycodone with a 2-3 day washout period between individual opioids in order to assess the potential influence of both diabetes and glycaemic control on opioid potency in these animals. The findings demonstrate that non-insulin treated STZ-diabetic rats of both strains exhibited a decreased rate of body weight gain and polydipsia, as well as progressive development of mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws and loss of morphine potency. Importantly, STZ-diabetic Wistar rats which were treated with insulin to maintain euglycaemia from Day 7 post-STZ administration failed to develop these diabetic symptoms for the duration of the 24-wk study period, highlighting the importance of chronic hyperglycaemia in the development of mechanical allodynia and morphine hyposensitivity in the STZ-diabetic rodent model of PDN. The research described in Chapter Four involved a 22-wk longitudinal study of the development of diabetes and its longterm sensory nerve complications, viz mechanical allodynia and opioid hyposensitivity, in the ZDF rodent model of Type 2 diabetes commencing at 7-wks of age. This study also examined the influence of four different diets fed to separate groups of ZDF rats from 7-wks age, on the time course for the development of diabetes, mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws and opioid hyposensitivity in these animals. Briefly, ZDF rats were sub-divided into four dietary groups, each of which was fed one of the four following diets for 22-wks commencing at 7-wks of age, viz: (a) Purina 5008&#8482;, (b) a domestically-produced rat chow of similar composition to Purina 5008&#61652; (termed Purina Composition diet), (c) a Diabetogenic diet, or (d) Standard Rat Chow. All rats underwent once-fortnightly measurement of BGLs, body weight, 24-hr water intake, and measurement of PWTs in the hindpaws. Additionally, ZDF rats underwent opioid antinociceptive testing, similar to that previously described for STZ-diabetic rats (Chapter Three), to investigate the influence of diabetes and dietary composition on the antinociceptive potency of single bolus doses of morphine and oxycodone administered at 6-weekly intervals over a 22-wk study period. The afore-mentioned data were compared with the respective data obtained from the pre-diabetic control group of ZDF rats that were euthanised at 7-wks of age prior to the development of hyperglycaemia. The results demonstrate that the ZDF rat develops mechanical allodynia in the hindpaws and opioid hyposensitivity in a temporal fashion, in a manner similar to that previously documented for the STZ-diabetic Wistar rat model of Type 1 diabetes (Chapter Three). For the four diets assessed, there did not appear to be significant differences between dietary groups with respect to the time course and extent of development of hyperglycaemia, mechanical allodynia or opioid hyposensitivity in the ZDF rat model of PDN. The study described in Chapter Five investigated the effect of both diabetes and dietary composition on opioid receptor mRNA expression in tissue samples collected from the five groups of ZDF rats used in the behavioural studies described in Chapter Four and outlined above. Briefly, mRNA expression for each of the &#61549;- (MOP), &#61540;- (DOP), and &#61547;- (KOP) receptors were quantified in mid-brain and spinal cord tissues prepared from 29-wk old diabetic ZDF rats maintained on one of four diets from 7-wks age, and compared with the respective expression levels in samples prepared from pre-diabetic ZDF rats euthanised at 7-wks of age. Overall, the findings suggest that diabetes does not alter opioid receptor mRNA expression in the mid-brain or spinal cord of diabetic ZDF rats at 29-wks of age relative to the corresponding levels of mRNA expression in the mid-brain and spinal cord of pre-diabetic ZDF rats at 7-wks of age. Hence, the marked reduction in the anti-allodynic potency of morphine and oxycodone observed in diabetic ZDF rats at 29-wks of age relative to that observed in pre-diabetic ZDF rats at 7-wks of age (Chapter Four) does not appear to be associated with a decrease in opioid receptor mRNA expression. In Chapter Six, the effect of both advanced diabetes and dietary composition on opioid-agonist stimulated [35S]GTP&#947;S binding was examined in spinal cord tissue membranes from the ZDF rat. Specifically, [35S]GTP&#947;S binding assays were used to assess the ability of a &#61549;-opioid ligand (DAMGO) to stimulate &#61549;-opioid receptor coupling to inhibitory G proteins in homogenates prepared from spinal cord samples of 29-wk old ZDF rats maintained on one of four different diets from 7-wks age (Chapter Four), relative to [35S]GTP&#947;S binding in homogenates prepared from spinal cord samples of pre-diabetic 7-wk old ZDF rats. As specific MOP agonist-stimulated [35S]GTP&#947;S binding was significantly decreased in spinal cord homogenates from diabetic ZDF rats at 29-wks of age relative to that for pre-diabetic ZDF rats (7-wks), this may contribute, at least in part, to the morphine hyposensitivity observed in diabetic ZDF rats at 29-wks of age relative to the pre-diabetic ZDF group. However, closer examination of these data revealed that specific MOP agonist-stimulated [35S]GTP&#947;S binding above basal did not differ significantly between the pre-diabetic group and the longterm diabetic group of ZDF rats. Instead, there was significantly lower basal [35S]GTP&#947;S binding in the spinal cord of ZDF rats at 29-wks c.f. 7-wks of age. Together, the findings suggest that impaired basal G-protein function rather than impaired coupling of MOP-r to its inhibitory G-protein may, at least in part, underpin &#61549;-opioid agonist hyposensitivity in 29-wk ZDF rats.

These applications may also pose an environmental and public health risk. Consequently, there is a need for the development of alternative systems to protect wooden structures from termites. Investigated here is the interaction between Australian termites, Coptotermes acinaciformis Froggatt, and to a lesser extent, Mastotermes darwiniensis Froggatt and Schedorhinotermes seclusus Hill, and a barrier system for protection of wooden structures. The aim was to develop an improved barrier for the protection of wooden structures that maximizes protection and minimizes environmental and health risks. Specifically, the performance of a barrier to protect wood against termite attack that incorporates a synthetic pyrethroid into polyurethane formulations is investigated. This research was conducted in parallel with other project contributors focusing on material science aspects of the research goals. A fundamental problem in assessing the value of termite barrier strategies lies in developing and interpreting laboratory assays that can deliver reasonable predictions of performance in the field. This is particularly the case with respect to the behaviour of termites over much longer periods in the field than can be undertaken in the laboratory. The approach to laboratory trials presented here is to define individual termite capabilities and, in combination with behavioural studies, to develop an understanding of factors which affect termite performance. The key experimental approach involved various laboratory based assays to evaluate termite foraging behaviour and performance against a range of barrier materials, progressing to field trials with the best performing material. Various species of termites; M. darwiniensis (Mastotermitidae), Cryptotermes primus (Hill) (Kalotermitidae), C. acinaciformis , Coptotermes frenchi Hill and S. seclusus (Rhinotermitidae), Microcerotermes serratus (Froggatt), Microcerotermes turneri (Froggatt) and Nasutitermes walkeri (Hill) (Termitidae) and Porotermes adamsoni (Froggatt) (Termopsidae); were investigated to determine the force that they can develop at their mandible tips. Larger termites can generate higher pressures on their mandible tips than smaller termites. By quantifying the mandible strength of a termite it was possible to contrast the capabilities of various economic termite species. Damage caused by an individual termite biting on synthetic materials was measured using electron microscope generated three dimensional models of indentations caused to the material. This was successful in quantifying the immediate capabilities of individual termites of different species. Most species were found to inflict a similar amount of damage to high density polyethylene. However M. darwiniensis caused much more damage than other species examined. Micro hardness testing was utilized to determine the relative hardness of pest termite mandibles. Termites were found to have mandibles much harder than any tested synthetic material. It was therefore found to be unrealistic to aim to develop barrier technology based on &#8220;harder than termite mandible material&#8221;. Trials using groups of termites in the laboratory demonstrated large differences in the performance of termites against various synthetic materials. There was a tendency for harder materials to suffer less damage. Mechanical properties of the barrier alone were found to be insufficient to stop termite damage. The resistance of polyurethane formulations incorporating insecticides to termite attack in the laboratory demonstrated a potential suitability for termite barrier technology. In behaviour trials, persistence of termite attack at the barrier face was found to be due not only to deterrent chemicals, but also to physical characteristics. Softer materials are not only easier for termites to remove but termites attack softer materials with greater tenacity, more termites spend more time attacking softer materials. Laboratory toxicity trials confirmed the bioavailability of Bifenthrin when incorporated within the barrier material and enabled the establishment of expected concentrations for effective protection. Termites were found to require direct contact with the barrier for mortality to occur. Trials designed to quantify repellence of the Bifenthrin in the barrier found that termites did not escape mortality by avoiding contact with the barrier material. As such pure Bifenthrin is shown to protect the barrier material directly by causing mortality rather than by repelling live termites away from the barrier. Field trials were conducted in northern Queensland where colonies of economic termites could be directly targeted. Wooden blocks were coated in polyurethane containing a range of Bifenthrin concentrations and trialed over an eight month period. Combination of the pyrethroid Bifenthrin in a polyurethane barrier at concentrations as low as 0.07% proved successful in preventing damage by the economically important termites M. darwiniensis and C. acinaciformis under high pressure field conditions. Only very small amounts of Bifenthrin migrated into adjacent soil, concentrations reached were in the order of 100 &#181;g/kg of soil. For comparison the MLR for Bifenthrin in bananas for human consumption is 100 &#181;g/kg. Bifenthrin in a polyurethane barrier could be used for the protection of houses and other wooden structures in the same manner as existing barrier film technology in order to minimise environmental and health risks associated with direct pesticide application techniques.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Isoptera, Coptotermes, Bifenthrin, barrier, foraging, repellence, mandible, synthetic materials, polyurethane, toxicity.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular Mechanisms of axon guidance and targeting in the olfactory system</field><field name="creator">Man-yee Chan</field><field name="description">Olfactory sensenory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory epithelium are located in the nasal cavity and project axons that synapse onto dendrites of second-order neurons within the olfactory bulb in neuropil structures termed glomeruli. Each OSN expresses one of the over 1000 odorant receptors (ORs) and are randomly dispersed across one of the four partially overlapping regions of the olfactory epithelium. OSNs expressing a single OR project their axons to typically two symmetrically bilateral glomeruli, one each on the medial and lateral surfaces of the olfactory bulb. The target choice of the OSN axons appears to depend on a combination of molecular determinants that first promote segregation of axons into broad regions of the olfactory bulb and then favor sorting and convergence into specific glomeruli. The role of ORs has clearly been demonstrated to play a significant role in axon sorting and targeting to the glomeruli, however other guidance molecules have clearly been shown to be required in the precise targeting of the OSN axons. During development of the mouse olfactory system, olfactory sensory axons first contact their terminal zone in the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb during late embryonic period and target to their appropriate glomeruli over the next few days. During this period, many axons can branch inappropriately into several glomeruli and overshoot the target layer and enter deeper layers of the olfactory bulb. The aberrant axonal projections are normally detected within the deeper layers of the bulb up to postnatal day 12. By the end of the second postnatal week, axon trajectories are refined and axons over-projections are seldom observed in adult animals. A detailed understanding of the process of axon over-projections enabled the identification of directional cues that navigate the outgrowing axons to their defined destination. There are two aims of the present thesis, first, to investigate the role of cell surface carbohydrates in the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying axon navigation in the developing olfactory system. To achieve this aim, transgenic mice expressing two glycosyltransferases (Mgat3 and 5) under the control of OMP promoter to drive expression in all mature OSNs have been generated. The results obtained from these transgenic mice showed that the transgene is expressed based on the ability to detect GFP reporter expression, however no apparent targeting defect in the olfactory pathway was observed from these transgenic mice. The purpose of the second study was twofold: 1) To examine the trajectory of olfactory sensory axons that penetrate past the glomerular layer in OMP-Zsgreen transgenic mice and 2) using in vitro cultures of the olfactory epithelium from OMP-Zsgreen mice which allowed visualization of mature OSN and their axons, together with extract prepared from inner layers of olfactory bulb to elucidate the impact of distinct molecular and cellular cues on defined OSN populations. Our results revealed that targeting of OSN axons was initially imprecise where extensive axons over-projection was observed in early postnatal animals. This targeting error was then refined later in development after the first two postnatal weeks and rarely observed in adult animals. The in vitro study using cultured OE explants to examine the effect of the extract prepared from the inner layers of the olfactory bulb on the axon outgrowth suggests the presence of a repellent activity in the inner layers of the olfactory bulb and that this inibition is stronger in P17.5 animals than P8.5 and P2.5 animals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a scenario-based coral reef ecosystem model to assist management following mass coral mortality events</field><field name="creator">Glen Holmes</field><field name="description">Coral reefs are experiencing increasing levels of stress due to climate change, overfishing, coastal development and nutrient runoff from agriculture to name a few. They are however, economically vital ecosystems in terms of both their income generating capacity and as a source of food for millions of people around the world. This predicament emphasises the need for effective ecosystem management to be able to balance the benefits of coral reefs with the inherent stressors associated with people utilising their resources. It is particularly important given the potential large scale impacts associated with climate change such as mass coral bleaching events. Similarly, much of the need for direct management of coral reefs exists in developing countries where the resources, information, and technology are limited or unavailable for such a task. This places them, in particular, at the high end of management uncertainty and impact vulnerability. Accordingly, there is a pronounced need to improve this capacity to understand coral reef ecosystem function and to use this to better predict the overall systems level outcome of management options. This thesis has sought to improve our understanding of key ecological elements of coral reef ecosystems and to build on this new knowledge to produce a widely applicable ecosystem model that will allow managers to better understand and predict the outcomes of their actions. Coral reef ecosystem behaviour is far from understood in its entirety and there are many facets that require detailed further investigations to be able to more confidently predict ecosystem response to any given disturbance. To enhance the current understanding of coral reef ecosystems prior to the model development, investigations were undertaken into the dynamics of nitrogen on a coral reef following bleaching induced coral mortality. The results showed that the rates of nitrogen fixation on surfaces made available due to a coral mortality event increased dramatically in the three months following coral mortality, potentially acting as a driving force for the ecosystem to pass through a phase shift to algal dominance. Application of these nitrogen dynamics to entire coral reef ecosystems required a methodology for scaling these sub coral colony processes to entire reefs. This scaling issue is particularly pertinent given the improved understanding of the overwhelming significance of micro-scale processes to community dynamics. The surface index (SI) concept, relating the two-dimensional projected area to the three-dimensional area of corals was refined and developed for variations of gross coral morphologies. This allowed for the scaling of nitrogen flux estimates to be made over entire reef systems, enabling the incorporation of these fluxes into an ecosystem scale model. One of the key factors associated with the potential for a coral reef to recover from a mass coral mortality event is the potential for new corals to successfully recruit. The process of coral recovery could potentially be enhanced if recruitment is viable in the immediate aftermath of a mortality event. Although investigations in this area were inconclusive, extensive herbivore action on turf assemblages up to eight months old indicated that recruitment may be inhibited through the high palatability of turf assemblages in this age bracket. Integrating these processes with the many other published dynamics of coral reefs allowed for the development of the dynamic systems model. By constraining the model structure to known relationships between the modelling parameters, the model can be calibrated to replicate the dynamics of any coral reef ecosystem. This allows the model to be applied to systems where limited data and/or resources are available, making it widely implementable in developing countries such as the small island states scattered around the tropics. The model is ideally suited to the adaptive management framework whereby managers can continually assess the potential future outcomes of management interventions. In addition, due to the spatially inexplicit and generic nature of the model, it can be easily adapted and integrated into large scale regional modelling frameworks or combined with other modelling packages such as socio-economic or fisheries models to provide enhanced management packages. The culmination of the targeted research and integration of existing knowledge has allowed for the development of an ecosystem model for coral reefs that can be easily adopted by coral reef managers throughout the world. It is however, by no means a definitive coral reef ecosystem model and there are many facets that can and should continue to be refined to enhance the reliability of the model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coral reef</field><field name="subject">ecosystem response</field><field name="subject">ecosystem based management</field><field name="subject">nitrogen fixation</field><field name="subject">surface area</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">ecological modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Tools for the Assessment of Social Competence in Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Catherine Hynes</field><field name="description">Background: Patients with non-penetrating traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are at high risk for damage to ventral prefrontal brain regions, due to the brain&#8217;s acceleration into the bony ridges of the anterior portions of the skull. Current neuropsychological assessments of these patients focus mainly on the assessment of so-called &#8220;executive functions,&#8221; which are associated with dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Ventral prefrontal pathology is more likely to disrupt social and emotional functions, but assessments of these abilities using objective measurements that require patients to demonstrate their competence are rare. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic social and emotional deficits are common in TBI, and that these difficulties result in significant functional impairments post-injury, making clear the need to develop and use objective assessment tools during clinical neuropsychological assessments. Methods: In the current project, the Global Interpersonal Skills Test (GIST), a questionnaire measure of social skills with both a self-rated and an informant-rated version, was developed, along with three novel or adapted performance-based measures of social and emotional functioning. The first novel measure was the Assessments of Social Context (ASC), a video-based task examining comprehension of social context using non-verbal cues, including the identification of emotions, intensions and positive or negative attitudes of one person towards another. The second task was the Awareness of Interoception Test (AIT), a heartbeat detection paradigm adapted from previous literature that measures participants&#8217; sensitivity to their cardiac function, which is implicated in basic emotional functioning. The third task was the Social Interpretations Task (SIT), an animation-based task adapted from previous literature examining participants&#8217; ability to apply a social interpretation to stimuli that are not inherently social in nature. All novel tasks were developed and piloted with healthy undergraduates. A group of patients with moderate to severe TBI (N = 16), and a group of non-brain damaged controls (N = 16) underwent neuropsychological testing. Standard neuropsychological measures including the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Digit Span and Digit Symbol Coding from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, phonemic (FAS) and semantic fluency (Animals) from the Verbal Fluency Test, and the Trail Making Test, as well as the novel measures to both patients with TBI and controls were administered. The following predictions were made: vi 1) The novel performance-based measures of social abilities would be more sensitive to the presence of moderate and severe TBI than the standard neuropsychological measures of cognition; 2) On the informant version of the GIST, but not the self-report version, patients would have scores than controls; 3) Patients&#8217; performance on the ASC would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this difference would be associated with real-world social skills, measured by the informant-version of the GIST; 4) Patients&#8217; AIT performance would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this would be related to their self-rated emotional changes; 5) Patients&#8217; SIT performance would be less accurate than controls&#8217;, and this difference would be associated with real-world social skills, again measured by the informant-version of the GIST. Findings: Findings were consistent with these hypotheses: 1) A statistically significant logistic regression revealed that a Social composite variable comprising the ASC, AIT and SIT was more sensitive to the presence of TBI (&#946; = 9.59, p &lt; .05) than a Cognitive composite variable comprising Digit Symbol Coding, Trails B completion time, and Phonemic Fluency (&#946; = 0.006, p = .466). 2) A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that informants of patients gave lower GIST scores to patients than the informants of controls (F(1,28) = 22.2, p &lt; 0.0001), whereas there were no differences between groups on the self-rated version of the GIST (F(1,28) = .35, p = .56); 3) Patients&#8217; ASC performance was significantly poorer than controls&#8217; on a MANOVA (F(1,31) = 21.7, p &lt; .0001), and ASC total scores were significantly correlated with GIST informant scores, using Spearman&#8217;s rank-order correlations (&#961;(31) = .624, p &lt; .0001). 4) Patients&#8217; AIT performance was significantly poorer than controls&#8217; using an independent samples t test (t(13) = 1.43, p &lt; 0.005), and qualitative investigation of subjective reports of emotional change among patients suggested a potential relationship between emotional changes and AIT performance. vii 5) Patients&#8217; SIT performance was significantly poorer than controls on an independent samples t test (t(30) = -2.12, p &lt; 0.05), and SIT scores were significantly correlated with GIST informant scores, using Spearman&#8217;s rank-order correlations (&#961;(31) = .460, p &lt; .0001). Interpretation: This research represents a preliminary step in the development of clinically useful measures of social and emotional difficulties following TBI. Given the small sample size of the patient group, and the presence of co-morbid difficulties among some of the participants in this research, further testing of these measures in larger, more homogeneous samples would strengthen the current results, as would using a comparison group of people with milder TBI, rather than neuro-typical controls. The complexity of social behaviour requires that the current measures be further validated against other real-world assessments of social ability, and that assessments of other aspects of social behaviour be conducted. Nonetheless, the measures described here are a promising start to supplementing the neuropsychological toolkit in an area that requires further development at the present time.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">frontal lobe, traumatic brain injury, closed head injury, assessment, neuropsychology, social skills, emotions, executive function, social dysfunction non-verbal behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning to Practice Transitional Agriculture: An Action Research Thesis</field><field name="creator">Gomathy Palaniappan</field><field name="description">Abstract This is an action research thesis, which documents a reflexive process of change undergone by farmers in making transitions from conventional farming to alternative farming. I achieve this through the process of answering the central research question for this thesis: How can the capacity of farmers be developed in the best way to assist them in making the transition from conventional to alternate farming systems? The original starting point for this study was concerned with addressing the problems of conventional farming. The consequences of which are arguably the continued risks to farmers&#8217; lives and natural resources as witnessed in India. However, as the study progressed I realized that changing from conventional farming to alternative farming like organics, biodynamics, permaculture and natural farming involved more than simply a change in farmers&#8217; practices. It was also closely intertwined with broader issues such as farmers&#8217; epistemological relation to the soil and the ontological construction of theories and concepts based on their values and beliefs that influenced their methodological practices. In order to examine the wider issues around transitions to alternative farming, this study was conducted in two regions. Namely, Australia, as an example of the western world practicing modern agriculture and India, as an example of the developing world utilising indigenous farming practices. The early cycles of my study occurred through immersion. This included my firsthand experience as an extension scientist in India and my direct involvement in a series of events in Australia, which assisted in framing the research question. To document the reflexive process of change undergone by farmers in transitions from conventional farming to alternative farming, I conducted convergent interviews with 20 participants in Australia and 18 participants in India. The results of these interviews elicited six major themes as follows: 1. Enriching soil health through perceptional change 2. Knowledge sharing through networking 3. Diversifying through biophysical and socio-cultural processes 4. Learning through experience 5. Indigenous knowledge built through accumulated experiences 6. Self sufficiency through recycling farm resources. Having identified these six themes, I proceeded to construct a tool for each theme so as to merge theory and practice and to address the fact that there are currently inadequate tools available for practitioners seeking to facilitate the change to alternative farming systems. The tools for the respective themes are as follows: 1. Typology on perception of soil in relation to practice 2. Dynamics of knowledge sharing influencing transition 3. Key components for diversity 4. Conditions that facilitate experiential learning for transition 5. Conceptual tool to capture beliefs and faiths around the practice 6. Farm sufficiency assessment tool. Finally, I develop and present an overarching tool, Assessing transition process based on themes, which combines all six of the themes and aims to deepen our understanding of the barriers present in the transition process on a larger scale. I also present these tools to six key people in Australia, who were able to confirm or refute their application in practice. Among the seven tools developed, the Typology on perception of soil in relation to practice is viewed as the most significant tool by the majority of the key people consulted for the following reasons: &#8226; This tool has the features of inquiry and action. This statement was supported by the key people who observed that the tool both informs the group of participants where they sit (inquiry) and allows them to see where they want to be, which makes them think about their actions. &#8226; This tool also has high practitioner relevance and is trans-disciplinary. Importantly, key people from different fields of specialization were able to identify the benefits of the tool in common. &#8226; Having said that the tool has a common application it may be used for diverse purposes. For instance, the tool may be used by an engineer or an architect to understand the epistemological relation of a land owner to their land and how this will influence their plans for land use. &#8226; The heterogeneous and diverse nature of the tool allows it to be used in any culture. &#8226; The tool, in itself, is reflexive in nature as it helps the user to reflect on own actions. It also has the capacity to remind the user of their accountability to the land resource being utilized. &#8226; The tool helps participants to think about the most appropriate or best actions for producing actionable knowledge. &#8226; The tool is transparent in exhibiting the different possible types of perceptions in relation to the soil, thereby providing the user with the opportunity for future action. Finally, this thesis examines and illustrates the transformational learning of farmers through an analysis of their epistemology and a reconstruction of their epistemology through ontology, which will result in continued transition for transitional agriculture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transition</field><field name="subject">conventional farming</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">action research</field><field name="subject">organics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contaminant dietary exposure assessment for a coastal subpopulation in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Veronica Matthews</field><field name="description">Polychlorinated-p-dibenzo dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) (collectively termed &#8216;dioxins&#8217;) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are three groups of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) ubiquitous in the environment due to their emission from numerous sources, high persistency and a propensity to be transported long distances. These compounds bioaccumulate in animal tissue, biomagnify through the food web and are toxic to humans and wildlife at relatively low concentrations. Humans may be exposed to POPs via ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption, however, for the general population, approximately 90% of the total exposure occurs through intake of contaminated food particularly from lipid rich products, including seafood. An Australian national study highlighted that, similar to many other countries, seafood contributes a major proportion to dioxin and PCB exposure of Australians. As typical for national studies, the exposure assessment utilised contaminant concentrations in retail (sea)food and consumption information based on national dietary surveys. The risk assessment showed that the Australian population on the whole has a very low risk of exposure to dioxins through food. However, more than 80% of the Australian population lives within 50 km of the coast, where recreational, cultural and/or subsistence fishing of local seafood is prominent, potentially from areas with elevated PCDD/F and PCB concentrations. Through analysis of local seafood contamination and community seafood consumption patterns, this study assessed PCDD/F and PCB exposure for a coastal subpopulation in Moreton Bay, Queensland who consume locally caught seafood from an area with elevated PCDD/F and PCB concentrations but relatively low (background) toxic equivalency (TEQDP) in sediments, which is typical for Australian nearshore marine systems. Despite low sediment TEQDP levels, due to the dominance of octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (which is considered less potent compared to the most toxic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin), elevated TEQDP concentrations were present in local seafood. In particular higher trophic fish species and some traditional seafood were found to contain TEQDP above current EU action and maximum limits. This highlights the efficiency of species specific contaminant uptake, bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes, which can result in accumulation of higher toxic dioxin and PCB congeners in biota. In contrast, concentrations of most organochlorine pesticides and flame retardants (polybrominated diphenylehters (PBDEs)) were relatively low in seafood from Moreton Bay. For fish, uptake of highly lipophilic contaminants, such as PCDD/Fs and PCBs occurs predominantly via food (biomagnification) and respiratory processes (bioconcentration) followed by selective accumulation of the more toxic, lower chlorinated 2,3,7,8 PCDD/F congeners. This study discovered that physical contact with sediment and dermal absorption of lipophilic contaminants also represents an important exposure pathway for sediment dwelling fish, resulting in higher lipid normalised PCDD/F, PCB and TEQ levels (up to 8, 5 and 3 fold) in skin compared to muscle tissue. PCDD/F and PCB congener profiles differed between muscle and skin suggesting biomagnification and skin absorption as the respective predominant uptake pathways for these tissues. Dermal uptake was estimated to contribute up to 46% to the total TEQDP load on a lipid basis in sediment dwelling fish species, thus representing an important exposure pathway, and extending the bioavailability of sediment-sorbed pollutants to the food web. Accurate determinations of lipid content and lipid TEQDP contamination within seafood samples are critical to human exposure assessments. To ensure quality assurance, different seafood extraction methods were tested to evaluate their impact on lipid yields and contaminant concentration. While levels of PCDD/Fs and PCBs on a lipid basis did not vary across the different methods employed in this study, sample preparation is a significant determinant of lipid yield from fattier fish species. If samples were freeze dried prior to extraction, 30% higher TEQDP values (on a wet weight basis) were obtained as compared to extraction using fresh sample material. Such variance in lipid results will have a significant impact on exposure assessments and should be taken into consideration during seafood contaminant analysis. The median TEQDP concentration from local seafood was approximately 25 fold higher compared to the retail seafood analysed for the national Australian risk assessment. The seafood consumption survey results from this study further indicate that coastal subpopulations consume considerably more seafood than the general population (2 to 6 times more in the present case study). This proved to be an important driver for contaminant exposure in this subpopulation. The average monthly dioxin intake for the coastal community ranged between 34 (best case) to 107 (worst case) pg TEQ kg bw-1 month1, (95th percentile: 114 - 362 pg TEQ kg bw-1 month1), an order of magnitude higher than that estimated for the general population. The contaminant exposure via the local seafood consumption pathway alone exceeded WHO tolerable daily intake levels in 11-44% of the population. These results have important implications with respect to adequate contaminant exposure assessments of Australian and other coastal subpopulations. The study outcomes highlight the importance of considering local conditions and information on contaminant fate processes for human exposure evaluations. Local seafood consumption in coastal communities can result in high exposure to PCDD/F and PCBs, even in background contamination areas. This information would be important to consider for developing future sediment quality guidelines and with respect to exposure and associated risks for coastal communities in general.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Persistent organic pollutants, PCDD/Fs, PCBs, seafood, traditional seafood, fish, exposure pathways, risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gender, mental health and smoking: A population based study in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Claudia Aguero</field><field name="description">Smoking related conditions kill approximately 5,000,000 people every year. There is evidence that smoking behaviour varies for men and women. Yet, determinants of smoking remain poorly understood, especially by gender. This Ph.D. thesis remediates this important gap in the literature, adopting a novel, transdisciplinary approach. The thesis was an epidemiological investigation of the joint and separate utility of sociodemographic factors, mental health and Social Cognitive Theory constructs as predictors of smoking for men and women. Participants were 3,502 residents of Queensland, Australia, taking part in a larger statewide population-based study investigating cancer risk knowledge and behaviours. The study consisted of a CATI telephone interview and a subsequent battery of self-report questionnaires. The thesis entailed four empirical studies. Study 1 (Chapter Two) investigated the utility of sociodemographic factors as predictors of smoking status by gender and by area by gender. Results revealed that sociodemographic variables were poor predictors of smoking status and that predictors of smoking differed by gender when analyses were conducted separately. Younger men and men involved in a relationship were more likely to be smokers, while younger women and women who were well educated were more likely to be smokers. Gender differences were also present when analyses were conducted by area by gender. In addition, smoking status for urban women was not significantly predicted by any of the employed sociodemographic variables. These results indicated that additional determinants of smoking, such as mental health, should be investigated. Study 2 (Chapter Three) was a psychometric evaluation of a tool utilized in the thesis to measure symptoms of anxiety and depression, the Kessler Scale of Non-Specific Psychological Distress, also known as the K-10. Results revealed that the K-10 is a psychometrically sound scale, ideal for measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population. It was also concluded that the K-10 is multidimensional, and that the best model for its factor structure is a first-order model composed by four first-order factors: nervousness, restlessness, negative affect and fatigue. Study 3 (Chapter Four) evaluated the discriminant utility of mental health variables measured with the K-10, separately and jointly with sociodemographic variables, in predicting group membership. The study investigated whether these variables could discriminate between ever-smokers and neversmokers, and among ever-smokers, between current smokers and former smokers by gender. This was intended to provide a glimpse into smoking initiation and smoking persistence. Analyses classified only a small percentage of smokers correctly. Nevertheless, results showed that psychological distress examined alone predicted smoking uptake among women. In contrast, smoking initiation for men was vi predicted by sociodemographic variables. In addition, persistent smoking for men was predicted by psychological distress while that for women it was predicted by sociodemographic factors. Study 4 (Chapter Five) investigated the utility of Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) constructs as determinants of smoking. This last empirical study investigated whether the addition of self-efficacy and outcome expectancies to mental health and sociodemographic variables improved prediction of smoking behaviour. Study 4 examined the utility of three models as determinants of measures of smoking among current smokers (smokers who have never attempted to quit and those who attempted to quit and failed). Nicotine dependence, age of smoking initiation, number of cigarettes smoked per day and past quit attempt, as well as intention to quit were the measures of smoking investigated. Results indicated that the full social cognitive model (containing both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy) was the most robust model, although neither self-efficacy nor outcome expectancies as constructs were particularly strong predictors. Nevertheless, self-efficacy was generally better than outcome expectancies. Both self-efficacy and outcome expectancies predicted measures of smoking for men, while only self-efficacy predicted the same measures of smoking for women. None of the models predicted a quit attempt in the last year among males. For women, only decreased fatigue predicted a quit attempt in the last 12 months: In addition, analyses conducted to classify which smokers intended to quit smoking in the near future correctly classified only a small percentage of those who did intend to quit in the near future, but correctly classified most smokers who did not. Analyses investigating which quitting method was most popular among smokers revealed that &#8220;going cold turkey&#8221; was still the preferred quitting method of more than half of smokers who had attempted to quit in the past 12 months but failed. Less than 15% of those who &#8220;went cold turkey&#8221; had also employed a cessation aid. The thesis supports the hypothesis that determinants of smoking differ by gender. The role of psychological distress in smoking uptake among women and in smoking persistence among men warrant further investigation. Future research should also examine the effect of other types of selfefficacy upon smoking behaviour. Smoking prevention and/or cessation programs might be more effective if conducted for men and women separately, addressing the particular determinants of smoking for each gender.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">smoking, K-10, epidemiological, mental health, self-efficacy, outcome expectancy, gender differences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Superabundance: art criticism and the antipodal simulacrum</field><field name="creator">Edward Colless</field><field name="description">The thesis addresses a mode of visual art criticism that it characterizes as &#8220;antipodal&#8221;. Antipodality is a false image of the world, a phantasm. An antipodal simulacrum could be described by what Jurgis Baltrusaitus has called a &#8220;depraved perspective&#8221;, which is a procedure of investigation dominated by the passion to objectify the empirical sign in a conceit of perverse logic. A perspective rendering taken to literalist excess (comparable to the literalising of figurative language) causes anomalies in and corruptions of what is depicted. The invention of the antipodes by cartographers of early modern Europe&#8212;a &#8220;logical&#8221; necessity of mapping that then required discovery of the antipodal land as a lost object&#8212;might be such an instance of a depraved perspective. In Baltrusaitus&#8217;s terms, we could say such depravity produces an &#8220;aberration&#8221; in the manner of the optical phenomenon in which a celestial body is apparently displaced and viewed as if it were elsewhere. Such an aberration forms the thematic content of this thesis; content which is the proposition of an aberrant critical conceit of &#8220;antipodality&#8221; as a simulacrum. This was a formative concept for my own activity of art criticism, in that it allowed a defining moment for an Australian postmodernism (notably in the 1980s) as an evacuated sign-system of art, a styling of art as pseudo-art. But it has acquired a trajectory for art criticism beyond the definition of Australian postmodern style. An antipodal art criticism is likewise a pseudo-criticism, that&#8217;s to say, it is a performative enunciation of falseness: it addresses a pseudo-object. Like the antipodes, art is a necessary fiction for criticism, a lost object that needs to be discovered. The most potent pseudo-art for Australian postmodernism was kitsch, and its style was camp. For contemporary art criticism, however, in a digital era, the most potent pseudo-art is pornography, notably digital pornography. Kitsch is the simulacrum of aesthetic form. Pornography is the simulacrum of eroticism. The thesis develops a critical discussion of works of art through the perverse logic of pornography as a depraved perspective. In this respect, &#8220;antipodality&#8221; provides the conceptual structure of this thesis, which polemically reflects on art criticism and the simulacrum through the media of visual art, film and literature. In a specific Australian context, the thesis discusses the work of Imants Tillers and Lindy Lee as oeuvres that have dealt with the false identity of the artist as originator of their performative but empty signature styles. The pornographic impulse of antipodality is dealt with through other modes of self-portraiture and performativity, notably in three generations of photographic technique and genre: Diane Arbus, Merry Alpern and Natacha Merritt. The performative nature of a pseudo-art is correlative to the performativity of pornography as pseudo-eroticism: both render dubious any authenticity of the desire motivating the performances. The thesis examines in detail three instances of falsely performative identities in film: the alluring and haunted figure of Madeleine in Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s Vertigo; the ingenue, picaresque protagonist of Roger Vadim&#8217;s sci-fi fantasy Barbarella; and Gough Lewis&#8217;s humanistic documentary on a porn star whose notoriety derived from subjecting herself to &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest gang bang&#8221;, Sex: The Annabel Chong Story. Each of these cinematic portraits operates, with varying degrees and moments of artifice, a metafictional transgression of figural borders. This strategy as a type of erotic theatricality is considered in detail with, among other passing examples, two celebrated short works of libertine literature (by Vivant Denon and Jean-Fran&#231;ois de Bastide); two paintings&#8212;one by nineteenth-century French academic artist Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, the other by the quite un-academic painter Pierre Bonnard; and with an erotic, theatrical innovation called the &#8220;Attitude&#8221;, introduced by Emma Hamilton as an amateur drawing room entertainment in the late eighteenth century. Hamilton&#8217;s captivating tableaux are discussed in terms of the phantasm, and the thesis is inspired by two literary exemplars of phantasmic portraiture: Edgar Allan Poe&#8217;s figure of &#8220;the man of the crowd&#8221; and Guy de Maupassant&#8217;s &#8220;Horla&#8221;. The latter, in particular, is presented as an analogy for the performative effect of antipodal simulacrum of art criticism.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art criticism</field><field name="subject">Australian</field><field name="subject">simulacrum</field><field name="subject">phantasm</field><field name="subject">art history</field><field name="subject">antipodal</field><field name="subject">eroticism</field><field name="subject">postmodernism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Peat Deposits of Moreton Bay:Natural Archives of Environmental Pollution</field><field name="creator">Jiajia Zheng</field><field name="description">Two ombrotrophic peat bogs (NC2 and BL2) from North Stradbroke Island, Australia, were precisely dated using 210Pb and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Sub-samples were total digested and sequentially leached for trace and major elements concentrations using ICP-MS and ICP-OES. Total Pb concentrations in both profiles increased with the time. PAAS normalized REE patterns were characterized by relatively flat patterns, with slight enrichment in LREE, and a significant negative Eu anomaly. The temporal changes in metal concentrations, 206Pb/207Pb ratios, REEs, and ash content observed in the two profiles suggest three different periods with distinct conditions in terms of dust provenance and atmospheric pollution: (1) Pre-anthropogenic (pre-1842); (2) Early industrial (from 1840s to 1920s); (3) Industrial (post-1930s). Ombrotrophic peat bogs may be reliable archives of environmental pollution, but also shows that adjacent sites may provide contrasting evidence. Despite their close proximity, the two sites show different trends in metal deposition. Metals in NC appear to be largely bound to minerals and inorganic materials, while in BL they are mainly organic-related. Indeed the peculiar behaviour of Pb in the BL profile suggests that biological process may cause Pb isotopic fractionation. Ash contents, texture, Pb isotopic compositions, Sb/Pb values, patterns of selected trace elements (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, Cr, Co, Sb, Ni, Se, As, Be and Mo), and their leaching behaviours suggests that NC and BL are chemically different types of peat bogs. NC peat bog is an open sink for elements, and can be used to define regional anthropogenic impacts. In contrast, the BL site appears to be influenced by local natural and anthropogenic processes and activities, such as changes in land use. Furthermore, it demonstrated that only some of the environmental-related trace elements preserve their original depositional record. Arsenic, Be, Co, and Zn are highly mobile under weak acid conditions, and are therefore not suitable for assessing temporal trends of pollution. Cadmium, Ni, and V may also be highly mobile under certain conditions. In contrast, Pb, Cu, Cr, Mo, and Sb are not subject to vertical migration, and are useful for establishing the pollution record of ombrotrophic peat bogs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">04 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">Peat</field><field name="subject">Moreton Bay</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Pb</field><field name="subject">trace elements</field><field name="subject">REE</field><field name="subject">European settlement</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theatre Audience Contribution through the Post-performance Discussion</field><field name="creator">Caroline Heim</field><field name="description">This dissertation addresses a significant gap in audience-orientated criticism by introducing a new approach to theatre audience research: audience contribution through the vehicle of a postperformance discussion. Audience contribution considers the physical and vocal behaviour of audience members as contributions to the theatrical event. Much scholarship has concentrated on the written and performance texts. What I posit as the audience text, comprised of audience contributions, has been predominantly ignored. The audience text is an integral part of the theatrical event that changes, adds to and informs the theatrical experience for audience and arts professionals alike. Over the past century the audience role has changed from interactive contributor to passive receiver. For the contemporary theatre audience member, opportunities to contribute to the theatrical event have been limited to laughter, applause and consumerist practices such as the purchasing of theatrical merchandise. Similarly in much theatre audience theory, audiences are perceived as passive receivers of the drama whose only active contribution is through autonomous cognitive meaning-making processes. The study takes into account the extant audience theory of audience reception and builds on this. Post-performance discussions, which have risen significantly in popularity in the last decade, are an under-explored and under-utilised avenue for audience contribution. A new method for the facilitation of post-performance discussions that encourages audience contribution and privileges the audience voice is introduced. Case studies of post-performance discussions held after performances of Anne of the Thousand Days and Who&#8217;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? trial this new discussion model. An audience text is created that informs the theatrical event and a new role for the contemporary audience is discovered: audience critic. Through the post-performance discussions, audience members become active contributors to, and co-creators of, the theatrical event.

A significant increase in the number of referrals and a broadening of the speech-language pathologist&#8217;s caseload to include patients with dysphagia has meant there has been less time to see hospital inpatients with communication disabilities. This change in practice has caused speech-language pathologists working in the acute hospital setting to question their role in relation to patients with communication disabilities in the acute hospital setting. The thesis applies the World Health Organization&#8217;s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework to explore the role of speech-language pathologists in the acute hospital setting, specifically the acute hospital stroke unit, in relation to patients with communication disabilities. The ICF proposes that a health condition can be understood in terms of four separate components. These components are Body Structures and Functions, Activities and Participation, Environmental Factors and Personal Factors. Whilst the distinction between body structures and body functions within the ICF Body Functions and Structures component is clear, there is less clarity about the relationship between the ICF concepts of activity and participation in the ICF Activities and Participation component. Therefore, the first part of the thesis explores the conceptual similarities and differences between the concepts of activity and participation generally and communication activity and communication participation in particular. This discussion concludes that the ICF concepts of activity and participation are distinct concepts that are considered separately in this thesis. Following this conceptual clarification, the thesis applies the ICF framework to patients with communication disabilities in the acute hospital stroke unit. Specifically, patients with communication disabilities are described from the perspective of communication-related body functions within the ICF Body Structures and Functions component, communication activities within the ICF Activities and Participation component and communication-related environmental factors in the ICF Environmental Factors component. It is important to understand how many patients experience a communication disability in the acute hospital stroke unit so that adequate supports can be developed. Therefore an efficient way of identifying patients in acute hospital stroke units with a communication-related body function impairment such as hearing, vision, speech, language and/or cognitive communicative impairment was required. Hence, the first study describes the development of ICF compatible scales, called the OHW scales, to rate a patient&#8217;s degree of speech, language and cognitive communicative impairment. These three rating scales were called the OHW scales because they reflect the WHO framework and also represent the authors&#8217; initials. The concurrent validity and interrater reliability of the OHW scales were then investigated. Results indicated that the OHW had acceptable levels of concurrent validity against standardised measures of speech, language and cognitive communicative impairment. The speech and cognitive communicative OHW scales also demonstrated moderately high interrater reliability, but exact agreement on the OHW language impairment scale was low. At a minimum, the OHW scales were valid measures of speech, language and cognitive communicative impairment and therefore they were used by the researcher to determine the number of patients with communication-related impairments in the acute hospital stroke unit. Patients in acute hospital stroke units may have communication-related impairments, such as speech, language or cognitive communicative impairments as a consequence of stroke. Patients may also have communication-related impairments (e.g., in hearing, vision and cognitive communicative) due to ageing and age related illnesses. Therefore, the second study of the thesis describes the number of patients with communication-related impairments in acute stroke units, regardless of the cause. Of the 69 patients screened, 88% had a mild or more severe communication-related impairment. In addition, 69% of inpatients, screened on two or more measures, had multiple communication-related impairments. Although many patients in acute stroke units have communication-related impairments, what may be particularly important is how many patients experience difficulty communicating their healthcare needs with healthcare providers in acute hospital stroke units. The ICF describes a person&#8217;s ability to carry out an activity, such as communicate healthcare needs, as an activity limitation. The ICF describes activity limitations in four different ways. Two ways are capacity with assistance and performance. Capacity with assistance indicates the person&#8217;s highest probable level of function in an activity given assistance and performance indicates a person&#8217;s level of function in the context of everyday life. Therefore, the third study of the thesis details how many patients experienced capacity with assistance limitation, that is, difficulty communicating their healthcare needs given assistance, and performance limitation, that is, difficulty communicating their healthcare needs during everyday healthcare routines. Results indicated that 51% of 65 patients had a capacity with assistance limitation and 57% had a performance limitation. Strong and significant relationships were found between patients&#8217; degree of communication-related impairments and their degree of communication activity limitation, in both capacity with assistance and performance. Furthermore, the presence of a communication-related impairment accounted for up to 77% of the variance in a patient&#8217;s capacity with assistance limitation. Such impairments only accounted for up to 32% of the variance in a patient&#8217;s performance limitation. This finding suggests that other factors, such as environmental factors also affect a patient&#8217;s ability to communicate, particularly during everyday health care routines. In light of this, a review of the literature on the range of environmental factors that influence communication between patients with communication-related impairments and healthcare providers in the acute hospital setting was conducted. The review of the literature indicated the need for research on the environmental factors that influence communication between patients and healthcare providers in the acute hospital stroke unit. Therefore, the final study of the thesis investigates this further. This study employed a focused ethnographic methodology to identify the range of environmental factors that appeared to influence communication between patients and their healthcare providers. Seven themes were identified including the healthcare providers&#8217; knowledge of communication-related impairments, skills, attitudes, and individual characteristics. Other themes included the presence of family, the physical environment and hospital systems and services. In summary, this series of studies indicates that the majority of patients admitted into acute hospital stroke units have a communication-related impairment and approximately half to two thirds of patients experience difficulty communicating their healthcare needs with healthcare providers. Whilst having a communication-related impairment increases the likelihood that a patient will experience difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, other factors, such as the communicative environment also appear to play an important role. Speech-language pathologists working in the acute hospital stroke unit may have an important role in identifying patients who are experiencing difficulty communicating their healthcare needs and supporting these patients and their healthcare providers to communicate in optimal ways. Further research is required to demonstrate that improving a patient&#8217;s ability to communicate with his or her healthcare providers improves a patient&#8217;s health outcomes. With this evidence, speech-language pathologists may be more able to support patients with communication disabilities to get the healthcare they deserve.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication disability, acute hospital stroke unit, stroke, ICF, communication-related impairments, communication activity limitation, environmental factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ROLE AND MODULATION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN AGE-ASSOCIATED CHRONIC RENAL PATHOLOGIES</field><field name="creator">Christine Percy</field><field name="description">Age-dependent changes in the kidney are often debilitating, can be life-threatening and are a significant cause of increasing health costs worldwide. Excessive fibrosis, a general lack of regenerative ability and an increase in apoptosis in cells that determine healthy renal function work together to cause chronic kidney disease (CKD). This thesis reviewed the literature and then tested hypotheses developed from this review, to provide information on the molecules and mechanisms that determine the age-dependent changes of CKD. Results in this thesis provide a comprehensive analysis of the molecular, structural and functional changes of age-related CKD, with particular attention paid to the longevity gene p66Shc. The present studies were able to make use of established ageing rodent colonies of various phenotypes. In the first of the research Chapters, rat models of age-related CKD linked with obesity and hypertension were used. The research tested the hypothesis that each cause of age-related renal change (ageing, obesity or hypertension) would have differing underlying genetic modifications that could explain any differences in renal structure and function. In particular, alterations in oxidant handling and energy metabolism were investigated to identify markers for age-related CKD. Young (3 months) and old (20-24 months) spontaneously-hypertensive rats (SHR), normotensive Wistar- Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar rats (normotensive, with excess visceral and peri-renal fat in ageing) (N = 4 per group) were compared for renal functional and physiological parameters, fibrosis, inflammation and oxidative stress. All of the analyses indicated the old obese Wistars had the greatest renal injury, inflammation and markers of oxidative stress. In particular, % phosphop66/ p66Shc, considered an oxidant stress marker, was significantly increased in these animals (p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that obesity and hypertension have differing oxidant handling and signalling pathways that act in the pathogenesis of age-related CKD, and that obesity alone may be a key causative mechanism of age-related CKD. x Oxidative stress is thought to be a major cause of age-related CKD. In chapter 5, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) that the added stress of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury on the ageing kidney would create an environment for increased injury; and (2) that this injury could be modulated by using a short-term anti-ageing strategies. Old (20-24 month) and young (3 month) WKY rats (females, N = 4 per group) were used to compare the effects of bilateral, 45-minute, IR injury with and without calorie restriction (a 40% reduction in food from baseline) or vitamin E (daily gavage of 1000IU) for 10 days prior to IR surgery and then for the length of recovery from IR (4 days). Histological, functional and molecular analyses were used. Old rats had significantly worsened renal injury compared with young rats with IR. Proteins involved in oxidative stress (HO-1, p66Shc and phospho-p66Shc), survival (PKB and phospho-PKB), apoptosis (Bax, Bcl-2), inflammation and fibrosis (NF-&#954;B, tumour necrosis factor-&#945;/TNF&#945;, transforming growth factor-&#946;/TGF&#946;) were differentially expressed according to age and development of IR injury. Vitamin E-supplemented animals showed minimal improvement and calorie restriction generally worsened the outcome in both young and old animals. Changes in protein expression support the notion that these short-term calorie-restricted animals were in a catabolic state, perhaps similar to protein energy wasting seen in some of the human dialysis population. In chapter 6 in vitro experimental models using primary human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) were utilised. Successive passaging in culture of the PTECs showed increasing markers of senescence and oxidative stress. The degree of senescence correlated with expression of the oxidative stress marker phospho-p66Shc and alterations in other key signalling molecules. Hydrogen peroxide (5mM for 1 hour) was used to simulate a burst of oxidative stress and the effects of leptin and resveratrol was examined. Histological and molecular analyses demonstrated some links with the previous in vivo results, for example the involvement of phospho-p66Shc in the development of cell senescence but generally the in vitro experiments did not replicate in vivo xi findings. The lack of complex, heterogeneous, cellular and growth factor/cytokine interactions of the in vivo environment are thought to be a factor in this disappointing result. The tendency for development of CKD differs in males and females in ageing humans. In chapter 7 characteristics of age-related CKD in old male and female rats were compared, summarising data on the WKY rats from Chapters 3 to 5. Minor differences between males and females in histology, function and protein expression are described, but these do not adequately reflect the findings of gender dimorphisms in development of CKD, reported from human and experimental in vivo studies. These experiments demonstrate some of the pathogenetic mechanisms of age-related CKD. The results indicate pathways or molecules that may be targeted in future therapies or may be used as biomarkers of early development of age-related CKD. In particular, the modification of p66Shc may one day be used to minimize renal damage and promote health in the elderly.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">renal ageing</field><field name="subject">fibrosis</field><field name="subject">oxidative stress</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value Orientations and Socialisation Processes of Pre-service Teachers in Health and Physical Education: A case study</field><field name="creator">Nigel Farley</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this case study was to determine the value orientations of health and physical education students (HPE) in an Australian physical education teacher education (PETE) program. Additionally, I was interested in the sympathy or otherwise in the relationship between the explicit Queensland HPE curriculum values and the value profiles of a cohort of pre-service teachers. Values were measured with the Value Orientation Inventory-2 (VOI-2) developed by Ennis and Chen, (1993). The culture and the curriculum goals of HPE and health and physical education teacher education (HPETE), contribute to the socialisation and construction of value orientations (Solmon &amp; Ashy, 1995). Descriptive statistics were compiled for all five-value orientations, along with t-tests and ANOVA&#8217;s. Participants (N=33) were recruited from the 3rd year HPE cohort at a large Australian University and were tested pre and post semester 2, 2007. Initial and final testing demonstrated a diverse range of value orientation profiles. This cohort of HPETE students emphasizes certain value priorities over others. 26 students within this study demonstrated a &#8216;Neutral&#8217; or &#8216;High&#8217; priority towards learning process (LP), additionally 22 students also have a &#8216;Neutral&#8217; or &#8216;High&#8217; disciplinary mastery (DM) priority. The students&#8217; priorities towards social responsibility (SR) were very low, with two students in the &#8216;High&#8217; category and eighteen in the &#8216;Low&#8217; priority. Initial &#8216;High&#8217; dispositions towards LP and DM are consistent with the findings of Solmon and Ashy, (1995). The SR results suggest that many PETE students&#8217; values are unsympathetic with the values underpinning the Queensland HPE curriculum. This may be cause for concern to those interested in curricula orientated around the principles of social justice, equity, diversity, inclusiveness, and supportive contexts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Value Orientations, Socialisation, HPE, HPETE, Pre-service teachers.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">As Best They Can: Canadian Women Athletes Speaking Sport Into Their Lives</field><field name="creator">Yvonne Becker</field><field name="description">Increased participation rates and significant performances of girls and women in sport over the last three decades would have many believing that the barriers and discrimination experienced in the past have been overcome and that continued participation and success into the future is unproblematic. Feminist research has problematized what now seems like acceptance of women&#8217;s participation in sport in this postmodern era by considering the location of the female athlete at the intersecting of discourses of femininity, masculinist sport, heterosexuality and homophobia. Situated among these powerful regulating forces, female athletes become subjects attached to often contradictory identities. For instance, the paradox of femininity and athleticism can result in a troubling experience that requires complex negotiation and time-consuming management of gender boundaries and behaviour expectations. Although sport has been considered a liberatory space for women, that view fails to consider that sport continues to maintain the status quo through workings of power politics that sustain oppressive social structures and relations. In this study, the review of literature in Chapter Two illuminates that sport, as it currently exists, perpetuates gender inequality and builds and maintains socio-cultural boundaries of normative femininity and heterosexuality. Unpacking women&#8217;s sport experience, therefore, involves exploring the discursive force fields that structure their everyday lives. Immersed in the dynamics of power and resistance, women performing so-called &#8220;masculine&#8221; activities such as skilled sport performance create a contradictory and precarious location for themselves. This location could be perceived as transgressive and liberating or as one that must negotiate, and possibly resolve, the tension between discursive expectancies and non-normative performances. My study examined the sport experiences of eight female athletes. Each was interviewed three times using a semi-structured interview process. During the initial interview, the participants were asked to provide the history and priority of sport in their lives and speak about the repetitive act of &#8220;becoming&#8221; an athlete as they make the transitions from other subjectivities. Chapter Four summarizes this conversation with each of the participants. Through a photo-elicitation process, one of the interviews was dedicated to revealing each of the participants&#8217; movements through the social spaces of their daily lives. Another of the interviews was supported by video footage of the athlete as she trained and/or competed in her sport(s). This data collection process allowed for the participants&#8217; multiple subject positions or locations to be spoken by them throughout the conversations. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using discourse analysis. In order to critique the various discourses that dis/advantage female athletes, the theoretical framework provided by feminist poststructuralism was chosen for this project. Through this perspective, detailed in Chapter Three, an understanding of how social power is exercised over and experienced by women is helpful in knowledge production that supports women&#8217;s on-going efforts of contestation and change. For example, continued improvement and achievement in sport performance vi could be the result of new versions of femininity fostered by my critique of the privileged female identity that allows for less docile and more athletic female bodies. Discourse analysis, as described in Chapter Three, allowed for surveying the discursive terrain of the lives of the participants. This method also illuminated the ways of speaking, descriptions and specific images that the athletes used to speak about their sport experiences. The women spoke sport into their lives and created a positive space that featured personal achievement, escape or freedom from the &#8220;rest of life&#8221;; an activity that supported a healthy body and a positive body image; a place of family support; and a social, fun and accepting environment. In contrast to this, the participants&#8217; sport space was troubled by the management and negotiation that was required by them to continue participation. Even though, as described in Chapter Five, they could speak sport into their lives in a positive way, they also spoke sport out of their lives (or at least further down the priority list) because of the effort that was required to juggle it or balance it within their multiple subjectivities. The sometimes simultaneous and always sequential contradictory gendered discursive force fields of motherhood, the ideal feminine body image, intimate relationships, compulsory heterosexuality, and physical activity required constant strategies of negotiation and management that are described in Chapter Six. A brief concluding chapter summarizes how the participants in this study found themselves frustrated by their &#8220;in-between-ness&#8221;. They are not athletes in the dominant heteronormative discursive space of male sport (they are &#8220;othered&#8221;), and they do not fit in the dominant discursive space of privileged femininity. The results of this study reveal that while sport presents itself as a site of empowerment for women, it also perpetuates and maintains traditional patriarchal values. The participants, however, creatively negotiated and renovated that patriarchal space to create a location in which they could evade the strength of dominant discourses and experience the benefits of sport engagement.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Canada</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Female Athletes</field><field name="subject">Feminist Poststructuralism</field><field name="subject">Femininity</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Resistance</field><field name="subject">Sport</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a continuous encapsulation method in a microfluidic device</field><field name="creator">Edeline Wong</field><field name="description">Delivery of a desired &#8216;active&#8217; compound (for example, starch (as an energy substrate)) to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is most easily achieved by oral administration. Unfortunately, the efficacy of most actives is greatly reduced due to the aggressive nature of digestive enzymes and processes which occur in this environment. A commonly applied strategy to prevent deactivation of the active prior to absorption at the target site is to encapsulate the active in another &#8216;sacrificial&#8217; or non-degradable polymer matrix. Traditionally, the active and matrix is processed into a microparticle format for easy oral delivery (dispersed in a liquid or paste). However, established encapsulation methods which rely on bulk-phase processing to produce these microparticles (e.g. emulsification) are far from ideal as they lack control over the final microparticle size, size distribution, composition and shape. The lack of control in the physical properties of the resultant microparticles in turn results in an inherent lack of control over the kinetics of release of the active at the target site. In contrast, recent advances in microfluidic device fabrication and methodology development have firmly proven that these new generation devices can produce monodisperse droplets and microparticles in a continuous, controllable and predictable manner. Their potential as a processing tool for the production of highly tailored microparticles for targeted delivery, however, remains to be fully explored. Both the physical and chemical (physicochemical) properties of microparticles made from a single polymer system may be altered by the deposition of one or more additional polymer layers onto the microparticle surface (for example, alternating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes to produce core-shell like particles), and this method has proven to be favorable with regards to retarding the release of active compounds. However, this addition of alternate layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (so called Layer-by-Layer (LbL) deposition or assembly) does increase the number of processing steps the particles must undergo prior to storage or delivery. Further, the overall effectiveness of this additional processing is still highly dependent on the properties of the original (core) microparticles. In this thesis, a microfluidic technique was developed to encapsulate starch granules in alginate-based microparticles. Using this continuous technique, the size of the microparticles produced were shown to be monodisperse and reproducible. The developed microfluidic device included a drop formation section, followed by a gelation region and a transfer section, where the particles made on-chip are transferred from the carrier oil phase to an aqueous phase prior to collection. The microparticles collected from this microfluidic device were found to be stable for several weeks and in stark contrast to particles produced via a standard bulk emulsification routes, no aggregation was observed over this time frame. The release profile of glucose (as a result of starch hydrolysation) from microparticles produced using both a standard bulk emulsification method and the developed microfluidic-based method were compared. It was found that the monodisperse particles produced using the microfluidic method showed significantly more retardation to release compared to the glucose release profile from bulk-processed particles. This retardation effect was more pronounced when a thin layer of an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (chitosan) was adsorbed onto the negatively charged surface (alginate is an anionic polyelectrolyte) of the microfluidic-processed microparticle. The microfluidic device developed within this thesis and the resulting tailored microparticles thus show significant potential with regards to offering a new generation of microparticle delivery systems with highly deterministic delivery over extended lifetimes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microfluidics</field><field name="subject">microparticles</field><field name="subject">microfabrication</field><field name="subject">Alginate</field><field name="subject">Encapsulation</field><field name="subject">surface patterning</field><field name="subject">release study</field><field name="subject">Rheology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Household Structure and Housework Hours: The Effect of Women's Changing Labour Force Participation on the Domestic Division of Labour</field><field name="creator">Jennifer Chesters</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I examine the relationships between changes in the structure of Australian families, trends in gender attitudes and trends in the housework hours of men and women in couple families. I examine how changing patterns of family formation and labour force participation are affecting patterns of time allocated to housework. Women&#8217;s responsibility for housework affects their ability to compete on equal terms with men in the labour market. Using data collected by three national surveys conducted in 1986, 1993 and 2005 I examine whether there is any evidence of convergence in the type of housework that men and women do (task convergence) and in the amount of time men and women spend doing housework (time convergence). I am primarily interested in whether Australian men are spending more time doing core housework tasks, namely cooking, cleaning and laundry. Tracking change over time in the US and the UK, researchers have found that there has been an increase in the amount of time men spent doing core housework tasks, however, there has been no evidence of a similar trend here in Australia. I review the key theoretical perspectives underpinning research into the gender division of labour: time availability, exchange of economic resources, gender and socialisation, before employing measures of the first three of these perspectives to examine change over time in the housework hours of men and women. The data analysed for this study do not include adequate measures of socialisation, therefore, I do not examine the association between socialisation and housework hours. Although previous researchers have examined the division of domestic labour within couple families, I focus on within gender comparisons examining the housework hours of men and women in various family types. By examining the absolute housework hours rather than the relative housework hours of men and women, I can determine whether men and women are spending a similar proportion of their housework hours doing particular tasks and whether the amount of time men and women spend doing particular tasks has become more similar. The division of housework into female tasks and male tasks is a major barrier to a more equal division of labour. Tasks traditionally regarded as female tasks- meal preparation, doing the dishes, cleaning the house, doing the laundry and shopping for groceries- account for the bulk of household labour and need to be completed on a regular, sometimes daily, basis. On the other hand, tasks traditionally regarded as male tasks- taking out the garbage, mowing the lawn, gardening and home repairs and maintenance- are more discretionary and can be completed on a more flexible schedule. Unless the division of tasks into male tasks and female tasks becomes less rigid, women will continue to spend more time doing housework than men. Overall, I find evidence of convergence in both housework tasks and housework hours. In 2005, men spent a larger proportion and women spent a smaller proportion of their housework time doing the core housework tasks compared to their counterparts in 1986. There is also evidence that the amount of time men spent doing housework increased and the amount of time women spent doing housework decreased. Men spent more time doing both female and male housework tasks and women spent less time doing female housework tasks and more time doing male housework tasks. These findings suggest that housework tasks have become more gender neutral. I also find evidence of a general trend towards a more equal division of labour with men in couple families increasing their housework hours by one and a half hours per week regardless of the employment status of their female partners and women in couple families spending less time doing housework regardless of their own employment status.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Division of domestic labour</field><field name="subject">family structure</field><field name="subject">gender attitudes</field><field name="subject">exchange of economic resources.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:188804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CASAS DE PAJA: Maya House Architectures, Traditions and Transformations</field><field name="creator">James Davidson</field><field name="description">In 1938, the Carnegie Institution of Washington published the results of ethnoarchaeological research conducted in Guatemala and southern Mexico by North American archaeologist Robert Wauchope. This seminal work, titled Modern Maya Houses: A Study of Their Archaeological Significance, aimed to understand the significance of traditional Maya houses (known in the study region as casas de paja) for the identification and interpretation of ancient dwelling remains in archaeological excavations. At the time, Wauchope documented only ten distinct house types among six of the 28 Maya language (cultural) groups. Due to its narrow scope, Wauchope&#8217;s investigation focused more on the physical properties of house construction and less on the social behaviours and beliefs generating the architectural forms. In recognition of Wauchope&#8217;s survey remaining incomplete, the primary aim of this dissertation has been to ethnographically record and comparatively analyse the remaining casas de paja in contributing to a greater cross-cultural understanding and theory of the entire repertoire of Maya house architectures. In combining both architectural and anthropological method, the author was able to make a number of important research findings; most notably that a pan-Maya, and pre-Columbian, semantic relationship existed between individual house types, indexing a shared cultural history and proto-Maya house architecture that possibly originated as early as 4,000 years prior to present times. In addition to the architectural documentation of house traditions, the author also investigated the processes of house transformation and change in the 70 years since Wauchope&#8217;s original survey. The rapid rate of built environment transformation in both Guatemala and Mexico over those intervening years underscores the importance of recording these cultural traditions before they pass. In contemporary times the few remaining chozas or casas de paja stand as historical reminders to a time past but not forgotten and embody traditional knowledge related to cultural beliefs and behaviours, which are intimately linked to the land, materials and climate of the region. Chapter 1 of the dissertation introduces the study region and establishes the primary aims and objectives of the research. Chapters 2 and 3 present the theoretical background and methodological approach governing the research project while Chapter 4 gives an historical overview of Maya house traditions. Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to the ethnographic findings of the regional survey and Chapter 7 discusses Maya house change in the years since Wauchope&#8217;s 1930s investigation. Chapter 8 details the contribution which the ethnographic investigation makes to Euromerican architectural theory in relation to non-Euromerican material and cultural histories in contributing to a world cross-cultural architectural canon and scholarship. In coming to a greater understanding of a past (pre-Columbian) and present (Maya casas de paja) subject, the thesis calls for an understanding, appreciation and acceptance of non-Euromerican architectural forms by Euromerican academics and practitioners in moving toward a greater acceptance of a diversity of human needs in the creation of social, cultural and built environments. The overall significance of this thesis lies in the position that the sustainability of lifestyle practices, and allocation of wisdom, skills, and the fulfilment of human needs, as embodied in building &#8216;traditions&#8217;, are of major relevance to current and future generations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">12 Built Environment and Design</field><field name="subject">pre-Columbian houses</field><field name="subject">Maya</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">tradition</field><field name="subject">transformation</field><field name="subject">culture change</field><field name="subject">Anthropology</field><field name="subject">ethno-archaeology</field><field name="subject">ethno-architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">APPLICATION AND APPRAISAL OF A MULTI-OBJECTIVE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR THE EVALUATION OF FARM FORESTRY VIABILITY</field><field name="creator">David Ian Jeffreys</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis presents innovative applications of Multi-Objective Decision Support Systems (MODSS) to forestry decision support. New MODSS methodologies were developed to assess and evaluate forestry practices and finance regimes. The assessment of forestry investments draw on case studies conducted in the Hodgson Creek catchment on the Darling Downs in south Queensland and on the Atherton Tablelands in north Queensland, Australia. MODSS are systems that aid decision-making, in which a set of alternative management options are evaluated against a set of decision criteria. The criteria, that represent the stakeholders&#8217; goals and objectives, are weighted to reflect stakeholder preferences regarding their relative importance. The weighted criteria scores are then aggregated to create an overall measure of option performance. In the first case study, MODSS procedures identified from the literature as being most suitable to forestry and the MODSS software package DEFINITE was used. After a critical review of the first study, a new MODSS was developed to address the particular needs of forestry evaluations and the weaknesses of current MODSS for addressing these needs. Limitations of the Hodgson Creek MODSS included lack of stakeholder engagement in the MODSS development process, inefficient use of the stakeholder time and an excessive work load on the experts in the scoring process. The new MODSS development process included the combined use of weighted sum and Electr&#233; aggregation methods, these being compensatory and non-compensatory aggregation methods. This combination of aggregation methods provided a measure of overall option performance and identified the presence of fatal flaws in the options. Various criteria weighting methods were trialled &#8211; including rank order methods, the analytical hierarchy process and direct assessments &#8211; to assess their utility for defining weights that reflected stakeholder priorities. A new hybrid weighting technique was developed using a combination of rank order methods and direct assessments. A new and innovative process for scoring options and criteria was developed, using an adaption of the Nominal Group Technique (NGT) in conjunction with a new computer-based Group Decision Support System (GDSS). This iterative process involved repeated rounds of individual scoring and group discussions. In the workshop conducted to elicit scores from experts, the GDSS was used to identify criteria where the elicited scores differed and discussions were focused on these criteria. After the discussions the options were rescored against the criteria and discussed further. This analysis was innovative in that uncertainty around the individual option scores was addressed for the first time using MODSS. This new application was developed in a spreadsheet using the risk analysis package @RISK. Evaluations of forestry options were undertaken at various time scales to address the long delay between incurring costs of tree planting and receiving returns from harvest. The various time scales identify the periods in which environmental and social benefits occurred as the trees grow and the economic benefits occurred at clearfell (or selective) harvest. This thesis specifically focuses on situations where measured and modelled data is not available, and seeks to increase the scientific rigour of the use of expert and stakeholder opinion in MODSS. The MODSS analyses revealed that forestry in the case study areas had the potential to offer considerable economic, environmental and social benefits to both landholders and the wider community. However, these benefits (and the associated costs) were not viewed as equally important. The MODSS developed in this study addressed these concerns. The benefits and costs of an option were reflected in its performance against the criteria. The degree of importance of the individual criteria varied from minor to high and overriding all other considerations. Criteria against which an option performed highly (the option&#8217;s strengths) were identified, as were criteria against which an option performed poorly (the option&#8217;s weaknesses). When these weaknesses occurred in highly important criteria, these were identified as fatal flaws in the option. The first case study in the Hodgson Creek catchment considered eight forestry options against 17 economic criteria, 12 environmental criteria and 12 social criteria. The second case study on the Atherton Tablelands considered 16 forestry options against eight economic criteria, six environmental criteria and five social criteria. The MODSS analysis identified the most preferred forestry options and the strengths and weaknesses of the options. In both case studies the most preferred options were large or medium-sized plantations with monoculture plantings with an element of non-landholder funding, in the form of government funding, joint ventures or land leasing agreements. These options had the highest performance against the economic criteria at all time scales and satisfactory environmental and social performance. Other forestry options that performed well included plantings focused on under-utilised land areas and salinity prevention areas, agroforestry, and selective harvesting of private native forest. These options generally had a higher level of performance against the social and environmental criteria, but lower levels of performance against economic criteria. These plantings would be undertaken for environmental and social reasons and not for financial returns. The application of MODSS developed in this thesis presents a significant scientific contribution to MODSS methodology. This thesis includes: the use of multiple time-periods to address the temporal differences in the delivery of benefits and costs, the use of NGT and a GDSS to provide a process for rapidly eliciting expert opinion, and the use of the combination of Electr&#233; and weighted sum aggregation methods to provide an overall measure of option performance and to identify fatal flaws in the options.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MODSS</field><field name="subject">forestry</field><field name="subject">stakeholder engagement</field><field name="subject">social</field><field name="subject">economic</field><field name="subject">environment</field><field name="subject">risk analysis</field><field name="subject">weighting techniques</field><field name="subject">aggregation techniques</field><field name="subject">decision support</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of gene dose on hyaluronic acid metabolism</field><field name="creator">Wendy Chen</field><field name="description">Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a high value biopolymer that has numerous biomedical and cosmetic applications. It is currently derived from two sources, namely animal tissues and bacterial fermentation (Fong Chong et al. 2005). The molecular weight (Mw) of HA can vary from several hundred thousand dalton (Da) to approximately 8 MDa (Widner et al. 2005). High Mw HA has surgical applications, and therefore constitutes a major component of the lucrative HA market. The current need is largely met by extraction from animal tissues, e.g., rooster comb and bovine vitreous humor (Shiedlin et al. 2004). However, the potential of contamination with adventitious agents (e.g., viruses) have raised regulatory concerns regarding the use of animal extracts in pharmaceutical products. Moreover, with recent reports of zoonotic diseases (e.g., bovine spongiform encephalitis and avian influenza virus), pharmaceutical companies are moving towards microbial HA sources. Although HA obtained from bacterial fermentation does not have the problem of viral contamination, this approach has not yet resulted in a process where HA of sufficiently high Mw for surgical applications can be derived. While attempts have been made to produce higher Mw HA through cross-linking, cross-linked HA is undesirable for certain medical procedures (e.g., ophthalmic applications) which requires a natural polymer with a short half-life. Nevertheless, due to its availability and the relative ease of purification, bacterial fermentation has the potential of replacing extraction from animal tissues as a preferred commercial source of HA. This thesis presents a good example of a metabolic engineering study where modern techniques (e.g., molecular biology, fermentation and omics technologies) are used to explain complex cell metabolism. The hypothesis for this study was that the precursors to HA, i.e., UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and consequently the genes involved in precursor generation, are important for HA Mw. However, environmental manipulation, e.g., anaerobic versus aerobic or glucose versus maltose, often results in large global changes in metabolite concentration and enzyme activities. This makes it impossible to resolve issues related to Mw control. Classical statistical methods do not provide a meaningful inference as the number of explanatory variables always exceeds the number of independent observations. Hence, it is difficult to distinguish between causative and accidental correlation. This work first examined the influence of manipulation of metabolite concentrations in the hyaluronan pathway to find an explanation for the mechanism of Mw control. To achieve this, the five essential genes of the hyaluronan synthesis (has) operon in Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) were first examined. These genes are involved in two pathways which lead to the production of either UDP-glucuronic acid or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Overexpression of genes involved in UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis decreased HA Mw, while overexpression of genes involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis increased HA Mw. The Mw variation generated provided a stepping stone for further understanding of Mw control of HA. The highest Mw observed was achieved with combined overexpression of pgi and glmU. This study proved that there is a positive correlation between UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and Mw. The first model for HA Mw control based on the concentration of activated sugar precursors is described in this study (Chapter 3). This correlation observed led to the hypothesis that high Mw HA can be achieved when an appropriate balance of the two HA precursor is maintained. Three genes in the two precursor pathways are not found in the has operon of S. zooepidemicus. To obtain a complete overview of all genes in the HA pathway, these genes were also examined using overexpression studies. Individual overexpression of these genes had negligible effects on HA Mw and production. Despite the positive correlation previously observed between UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and Mw, sequential overexpression of genes involved in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine precursor pathway did not increase Mw of HA produced. This is surprising since the highest pool of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was achieved in this case. This suggests that a threshold effect is present in the correlation between UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and Mw. This threshold effect may be defined by a balance between the two precursors. To investigate this phenomenon further, the precursor ratio was also manipulated by co-metabolising glucose and N-acetylglucosamine. Similar to the previous experiment, a significant increase in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine levels was observed despite only a marginal increase in Mw (Chapter 4). Surprisingly, an increase in Mw was observed with the introduction of a plasmid in S. zooepidemicus. This plasmid effect was studied on a global scale using transcriptome and proteome analysis to understand the changes occurring in the system. The increase in Mw due to the plasmid effect is independent of the functions, i.e., nisin promoter or antibiotic resistance, encoded in the plasmid. A gene involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine production, UDP-N-acetylglucosamide 1-carboxivinyltransferase (murA), was significantly down-regulated in both the plasmid bearing strain and the high Mw strain (pgi). In addition, overexpression of murA decreased both the concentration of activated sugar precursors and HA Mw. There was however no evidence of down-regulation of murA in the plasmid containing strain from transcriptomics data. This suggests that control is exerted either at the translation level or by protein degradation (Chapter 5). This thesis contributes and represents an ongoing effort to understand the elusive mechanism of Mw control of HA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Streptococcus zooepidemicus</field><field name="subject">hyaluronic acid</field><field name="subject">molecular weight control</field><field name="subject">has operon</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189069</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Endometriosis and naevus-associated gene variants in relation to risk of cutaneous melanoma</field><field name="creator">Marina Kvaskoff</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Background Cutaneous melanoma is a potentially lethal cancer for which incidence rates have risen dramatically in white-skinned populations worldwide over the past decades. While some risk factors for melanoma have been clearly established, such as pigmentary characteristics, sun exposure, and familial history of the disease, emerging evidence suggests that other factors, such as hormonal and genetic factors, may play a role in the aetiology of this cancer. The present work aimed at 1) examining the relationships between hormonal factors, benign gynaecological conditions, and the risk of melanoma, and 2) to explore shared risk factors for endometriosis and melanoma in a large French prospective cohort; and 3) to study the potential associations between novel naevus-associated gene variants and the risk of melanoma in a large Australian population-based study. Methods The E3N prospective cohort includes 98,995 French women insured by a national scheme mostly covering teachers, and aged 40-65 years at inclusion. Women were followed-up approximately every two years starting in 1990 through self-administered questionnaires. A first investigation focused on the potential association between a personal history of endometriosis or of other benign gynaecological conditions and the risk of melanoma, which was examined in the E3N cohort using Cox proportional hazards regression models. A second study explored the potential relationships between cutaneous phenotypic factors associated with melanoma and the risk of endometriosis in the E3N cohort, using unconditional logistic regression models. A third investigation used data from the Q-MEGA (an Australian study that followed-up four population-based samples of melanoma patients in Queensland, diagnosed between 1987 and 1995), as well as from the BTNS (a study including adolescent twins and their parents), from which the parents of the twins served as healthy controls in the present investigation. The association between novel naevus-associated gene variants and the site- and subtype-specific risk of melanoma was assessed using unconditional multinomial logistic regression models. Results A significantly positive association was observed between a personal history of endometriosis and the risk of melanoma in the E3N cohort, as well as a significantly positive association between a personal history of uterine fibroma and melanoma risk. The association between endometriosis and melanoma was even stronger when restricting to endometriosis reported as treated or diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery. However, a history of ovarian cyst, uterine polyp, breast adenoma/fibro-adenoma or breast fibrocystic disease was not significantly associated with the risk of melanoma. Also, significantly positive dose-effect relationships were found in the E3N cohort between the risk of endometriosis and skin sensitivity to sun exposure, number of naevi, and number of freckles, while no significant associations were found with hair or skin colour. Finally, variants of MTAP, PLA2G6 and IRF4 were significantly associated with the propensity to develop naevi in the Q-MEGA study. There was also a statistically significant association between MTAP rs10757257 and the risk of melanoma. Although there was no evidence that this association varied according to anatomical site of the tumour, the risk alleles of this polymorphism were more common in patients with superficial spreading melanoma or nodular melanoma than in controls, while patients with melanoma of the lentigo maligna type were no more likely than controls to carry these alleles. In contrast, no association was found between PLA2G6 and IRF4 variants and the risk of melanoma, globally or by site or type of melanoma. Conclusion The present findings suggest a positive association between endometriosis and melanoma, for which they constitute the strongest evidence to date. This finding may reflect the existence of shared risk factors between endometriosis and melanoma, which is supported by the finding of significant associations between endometriosis and some cutaneous phenotypic traits that are established risk factors for melanoma. Because these traits are mostly genetically determined, it can be speculated that endometriosis and melanoma share similar genetic characteristics. More research will be needed in order to clarify common pathways between endometriosis and melanoma. The finding of a positive association between uterine fibroma and melanoma risk had not been previously reported and warrants further investigation. The presented results also confirm an association between MTAP, PLA2G6 and IRF4 variants and naevus propensity, as well as an association between MTAP and melanoma. The findings suggest that the relationship is subtype-specific, which confirms and further refines the overarching &#8220;divergent pathways&#8221; model. Since MTAP is located at the same locus as CDKN2A, which has also been associated with naevus counts, further research will be necessary to determine whether these results can be attributed to MTAP independently of CDKN2A.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cutaneous melanoma</field><field name="subject">Endometriosis</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Genes</field><field name="subject">Naevus</field><field name="subject">Polymorphisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Buddha's Second Renunciation: doubt, groundlessness and autonomy in contemporary Western Buddhism</field><field name="creator">Martin Kovacic</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a major trend (what might be termed a &#8220;post-Buddhism&#8221;) within contemporary Western Buddhist thinking, and hence practice, emphasising the epistemic, existential and ethical autonomy of self as it engages with the Asian Buddhist traditions. Aligning its enquiry with a corresponding hermeneutic of the Buddha&#8216;s biography in his &#8220;second renunciation&#8221; (his social-psychological and praxiological relinquishment of the structures of religious authority) it focuses on the work of contemporary Western dharma teachers Stephen Batchelor, David Loy and Alan Clements. Their respective emphases of agnostic doubt, ontological groundlessness, and existential-ethical autonomy are investigated in turn, alongside a corresponding reading of the Buddha&#8216;s praxis prior to his enlightenment. Of interest to academic Buddhist Studies, this analysis introduces potential re-theorisations of the meta-epistemic nature of Buddhist praxis and the phenomenology of self and Buddhist &#8216;non-self&#8217; as it/they engage with both Buddhist and Derridean deconstructive (contemplative and intellectual) praxis. It also considers a re-contextualisation of Buddhist ethics as it is influenced by the deconstructive and ethical strategies of Derrida and Levinas, as well as a (native but under-explored) Buddhist &#8216;ethics of non-duality.&#8217; (All of these themes might be seen as more or less implicit also in the work of Western Buddhist theorists such as Roger Jackson, John Makransky, Jos&#233; Ignacio Cabez&#243;n, Alan B. Wallace, John Pickering and so on, and their deconstructionist counterparts in John Caputo, Robert Magliola, Steven Laycock, Carl Olson and others.) The thesis concludes with a general theorisation of the newly-inflected models of Buddhist enlightenment, praxiology and ethical engagement that necessarily emerge from such a shift of emphasis: a post-secular, non-hierarchical trans-religious culture of self-determination both within and without tradition. The Buddha&#8216;s enlightenment itself emerges as a heterogeneous culture of human freedoms rather than a form of univocal religious transcendence. Similarly, Batchelor, Loy and Clements&#8217; concerns around authenticity can be seen as productive elements of an evolving model of Buddhism within Western culture: one that in paradoxically grounding itself in &#8216;groundlessness,&#8217; returns to the meta-religious roots of Gotama Buddha&#8216;s own socio-historic transformation of the (religious and other) conditions of his time. Such a transformation becomes characterised by a greater attention to the contingencies of the unique self and its environment, knowledge-acquisition and its constructed character, justice and ethical ambiguity, and the indeterminacy of normative religious claims.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western Buddhism, biography of the Buddha, contemplative praxiology, non-dual ontology, Buddhist psychotherapy, deconstruction, post-secularity, Levinasian ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industry Policy,Finance and the AIDC: Australia from the 1950s to the 1970s</field><field name="creator">Carol Windsor</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis, conceived within a Marxist framework, addresses key conceptual issues in the writing and theorising on industry policy in post second world- war Australia. Broadly, the thesis challenges the way that industry policy on the left of politics (reflected in the social democratic and Keynesian positions) has been constructed as a practical, progressive policy agenda. Specifically, the thesis poses a direct challenge to the primacy of the &#8216;national&#8217; in interpreting the history of industry policy. The challenge is to the proposition that conflicts between national industry and international finance arose only from the mid 1980s. On the contrary, as will be seen, this is a 1960s issue and any interpretation of the debates and the agendas surrounding industry policy in the 1980s must be predicated on an understanding of how the issue was played out two decades earlier. As was the case in the 1960s, industry policy in the 1980s has been isolated from two key areas of interrogation: the role of the nation state in regulating accumulation and the role of finance in industry policy. In the 1950s and more so in the 1960s and early 1970s there was a reconfiguration of financing internationally but it is one that did not enter into industry policy analysis. The central concern therefore is to simultaneously sketch the historical political economy on industry policy from the 1950s through to the early 1970s in Australia and to analytically and empirically insert the role of finance into that history. In so doing the thesis addresses the economic and social factors that shaped the approach to industry finance in Australia during this critical period. The analysis is supported by a detailed examination of political and industry debates surrounding the proposal for, and institution of, a key national intervention in the form of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Industry policy, finance, global, nation state, AIDC, 1960s, Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrestrial Biodiversity Offsets: The Development of Ecological Guidelines to Inform Planning.</field><field name="creator">Kelsey Dahl</field><field name="description">Development actions such as urban, residential, commercial, industrial and mining contribute significantly to the loss of biodiversity worldwide. As development and subsequent loss and degradation of habitats continue, terrestrial biodiversity offsets, or mitigation schemes are conservation instruments that increasingly are being developed, implemented, and used throughout Australia and abroad. However, the failure of offset policies and practices to incorporate sound ecological principles into their design and implementation has led to ineffective conservation and management of biodiversity through offsetting. The aim of this research was to develop a &#8216;recommended best practice&#8217; offset framework for environments experiencing development pressure, and to inform planners and decision makers on a sound ecological approach to improve biodiversity outcomes for terrestrial ecosystems through the use of offsetting/mitigation schemes. A content analysis technique was applied to evaluate 26 local, provincial, and national biodiversity offset policies, guidance/discussion papers, and planning documents from five countries. Five ecological and planning criteria were applied to evaluate the offset policies. The results from the policy evaluation found that most offset policies contained vague, ambiguous statements and difficult to apply concepts and these results were consistent with a plethora of existing literature, which had identified that the planning of offsets lacked effective consideration and implementation of landscape-ecological principles, and that the protection of biodiversity through offsetting was not occurring. It is therefore important that national, state, and regional policies provide sufficient detail, with definitive performance criteria, indicators and targets, rather than vague principles which are open to ambiguous interpretation and inconsistency in implementation. The results from this research suggested that offset policies failed to protect biodiversity in that the majority of policies evaluated did not effectively incorporate ecological principles that would result in no-net-loss of biodiversity outcomes. This included a failure to recognise and consider the impact of offsets at a landscape-ecosystem scale in relation to ecosystem functionality and the viability of biotic populations. This research also indicated that a variety of tools (e.g., remote sensing, field surveys, and expert opinion) can be used to ensure effective consideration of landscape, ecological, and planning aspects of offsetting. The results of a case study in the Coomera-Pimpama region of Gold Coast City, Australia found that Gold Coast City Council explicitly considered only two of the five recommended off-setting criteria outlined in this research and as a result the conservation of biodiversity and in particular the habitat of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) in this area remained threatened. Key strategies were identified to help improve biodiversity outcomes from offsetting and these included: requirements to assess both impacted and offset sites, minimisation of threats to offset sites, and collaboration with professionals in other agencies, ensure that statements are accompanied by definitions, policies provide sufficient detail with definitive performance criteria, indicators and targets, active engagement with agencies dealing with offsetting procedures, professionals, or researchers, effective commitments to facilitative integration, structural integration and collaboration, and strategic integration.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Offset, mitigation, policy evaluation, biodiversity, criteria, terrestrial, case study</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of higher education for knowledge on and for Africa: A historical critique</field><field name="creator">Adelino Chissale</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the ways in which higher education in Africa has been construing its mission for Africa&#8217;s development and how such constructions are shaped by particular global regimes of knowledge on development. The thesis unpacks the ways in which such regimes are deployed using specific technologies: neo-liberal precepts on economic development. To that end, I pose a set of questions which can be summarized in these two: How has higher education in Africa discursively construed Africa&#8217;s experiences? Second, in which terms such constructions have helped responding to Africa&#8217;s problems of development? Taking Mozambican higher education as a unit of analysis, I used postcolonial theory to unsettle neo-liberal regimes of development and to show how contingent they are. Methodologically, a historical critique was carried out to historize neo-liberal globalization as a contingent process and to understand multiple possibilities of construing Africa&#8217;s experiences. My data consisted of texts discussing ways in which Africa is discursively understood by both, African and Western scholarship, higher education policy in Mozambique, interviews with senior administrators of some Mozambican higher education institutions and text materials from higher education institutions&#8217; websites in Mozambique. The findings suggest that, on the one hand, constructions of Africa as being in crisis are not new. In fact, for centuries Africa has always been a subject of knowledge from which the West constructs its differences. It is from such differences that the West assumed a civilizing mission in order to integrate African peoples in the world order. On the other hand, African scholars&#8217; responses to Western constructions of Africa&#8217;s experiences end up building another crisis at the theoretical level: the difficulties of thinking effectively on Africa so as to solve its problems. The second finding is that Mozambican higher education&#8217;s responses to the crisis have been marked by a development agenda within the broader context of Mozambique&#8217;s history from late the 1970s onwards: first, within the socialist model of central planning economy and, second, within the international agenda of global neo-liberal market economy. My analysis suggests that both development practices reflect, to some extent, continuities of colonial regimes of development which did not take into account the contextualities of the colonized. Finally, my investigation found that higher education institutions in Mozambique are responding to development challenges based on very technological conceptions of development following global trends. The thesis contends that an engagement with the ethics of knowledge and development would lead to a development model more preoccupied with the social contexts beyond market rationalities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Africa, developmentalist discourses, higher education, historical critique, neo-liberal globalization, postcolonial theory, post-independent Mozambique, regimes of knowledge.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ambivalent Fictions: Youth, Irony and Affect in American Smart Film</field><field name="creator">Deborah Thomas</field><field name="description">Smart film, a term coined by Jeffrey Sconce in his 2002 Screen article, &#8220;Irony, Nihilism and the New American &#8216;Smart&#8217; Film&#8221;, refers to a wave of controversial, contemporary American films characterised by irony, quirky black humour, deadpan performance and an observational, blank style. Apart from Sconce, there has been little theorisation on smart cinema within the field of American screen studies. This thesis redresses this gap by providing the first extended study on smart film. It draws on, and adds to, the framework provided by Sconce, via the examination of a particular &#8216;subset&#8217; of smart films concerned with the representation of youth and adolescence. These specifically target a more adult, &#8216;smart&#8217; niche audience, who derive pleasure from their ironic &#8216;cleverness&#8217;, and &#8216;arty&#8217; sensibility. In particular, this project focuses on the way these films are differentiated from more mainstream narrative cinema by their generic, affective and ethical structures. Following Sconce, this thesis analyses the constituents of the &#8216;art of the smart&#8217;&#8212;of the aesthetic strategies that differentiate the smart youth film, and the modes of address that may encourage, or discourage, particular experiences of affectivity and ethical engagement in the films&#8217; portrayals of their youthful, anti-heroic protagonists. This includes a discussion of their cinematic origins, their production contexts with specific reference to institutional shifts in American independent cinema, and the way their reception is particularly aligned to the cultural tastes and consumption patterns of &#8216;Generation X.&#8217; This thesis argues that smart film necessitates the development of more far-reaching ways of theorising the intersection between cinema, genre and youth. It extends the current theorisation on melodrama and the teenpic by arguing that smart film incorporates stylistic and thematic features, which both intersect with these established generic modes for representing youth and the family, and, at the same time, reflect a paradigm shift away from them as a result of their emphasis on irony and black comedy. It explores the cultural significance of their representations of youth, and their familial relationships, and the way this relates to social and cinematic constructions of youth and the family over time. This draws particular attention to their engagement with more serious, socially relevant, and taboo acts of sexual transgression, and how this is problematically mediated by what may appear as an &#8216;inappropriate&#8217; aesthetic of black comedy. Much of the distinction of smart youth films lies in the way they challenge normative modes of cinematic representation via their portrayals of youth, which combine psychological realism with blank, ironic affect. This has specific implications in terms of their spectatorship and reception, and leads to a central concern in this thesis to determine the ways in which irony and distanciation create ambivalent modes of engagement in these films. This is specifically examined in relation to character, drawing on the cognitive framework provided by Murray Smith&#8217;s &#8220;structure of sympathy&#8221;, and the analysis of their ironic, anti-naturalistic strategies of performance, which complicate a realist construction of character subjectivity, authenticity, and allegiance. However, this thesis also argues that an astute examination of smart film&#8217;s formal content and narrative construction often reveals key moments of sincerity, character authenticity, and avenues of empathy that may allow for a momentary emotional connection with character and the filmic world. The final chapter focuses on the ethical dimension of these films, their relationship with nihilism, and the question of whether youth films have a responsibility to offer positive role models and ethical guidance. It discusses the way that irony functions as a strategic gesture, which can offer incisive moral and social criticisms, but is complicated by the lack of cues for how to morally judge, or emotionally relate to, characters and their actions. Overall, smart films&#8217; ambivalence suggests that the spectator may be required to extend their paradigms of response, particularly in the way these films articulate their &#8216;taboo&#8217; content. This necessitates an examination of the dialogic, intersubjective process of the way the materiality of the film intersects with the socialised, contextual body of the spectator to embrace the possibility of a more active, intellectual spectatorship. Specifically, this incorporates an evaluation of the social cognitions, epistemology, and pleasures derived from the contemporary circulation and comprehension of irony, and how this can generate an understanding of smart film in relation to their affective and ethical regimes. Finally, this thesis concludes with an examination of the influence of smart film on television and current post-ironic trends in American cinema.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">smart film, youth, teenpics, genre, irony, affect, ethics, nihilism, spectatorship, post-irony</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">First language influence on second language syntactic processing of English relative clauses</field><field name="creator">Ken-ichi Hashimoto</field><field name="description">Fluent sentence comprehension requires the automatic application of grammatical principles, in combination with other kinds of information, to a linear input string. The latter can vary greatly in complexity, and it has been observed that structures that involve non-adjacent relationships (non-local dependencies) cause particular processing difficulties, for even fluent readers. This thesis focuses on the potential role that L1 transfer plays in processing non-local dependencies in the L2. Although L1 transfer has been demonstrated in a variety of L2 domains (Juffs, 2005), the degree to which L1 syntactic properties influence the L2 in real-time processing remains an open question (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). A better understanding of L1 influence on L2 processing has important implications for emerging models of L2 sentence processing and SLA theory in general. This thesis examines L1 effects on the processing of L2 English relative clauses. It builds on established models of L1 relative clause processing (e.g., Gibson, 1998) and focuses on the asymmetry observed in the processing of subject versus object relative clauses. Research has shown that L1 individuals find object relative clauses more difficult to process than their subject counterparts (King &amp; Just, 1991), and off-line L2 research suggests that this asymmetry might hold for L2 processing as well (Izumi, 2003; Kanno, 2007). This thesis will examine the asymmetry on-line and investigate the role that L1 background plays in on-line performance, both alone and in combination with other processing factors. The main data are on-line performance by three groups of advanced-level learners of L2 English from Japan, China, and Vietnam. The three L1s differ from English to varying degrees in relative clause formation, as reflected in head direction, branching direction and the presence of an overt relative marker. Vietnamese shares all three properties with English and Japanese none, leading to the prediction that the Japanese learners will have the greatest difficulty, as evident in the largest subject/object asymmetry in processing times. Evidence for the effect of L1 syntactic properties on L2 processing will be sought in a set of studies that compare processing outcomes for these learners across key individual difference factors in L2 processing, working memory capacity, lexical processing efficiency, and proficiency. The effect of non-structural information, in the form of animacy contrasts and frequency effects, on L2 syntactic processing across the L1 groups will also be examined. By systematically examining group differences across these key factors, the degree and nature of potential L1 influence on the processing of these non-local dependencies can be better assessed. Three groups of advanced-level L2 English learners from China, Japan, and Vietnam, a group of intermediate-level learners in Japan, and native English controls participated in the data collection. Participants were first tested on a battery of individual difference measures that established language proficiency and general processing skill for individual participants and groups. On-line reading data of relative clause structures were then collected and reported in a set of five studies. Study 1 examined reading when the target structures contained high frequency content words, which minimized word recognition demands. Advanced L2 learners took longer to read object relative clauses, and the difference was the greatest for the Japanese group. Study 2 revealed that the subject/object asymmetry and L1 influence evident in Study 1 disappeared when word recognition was effortful, as in sentences with low frequency words, suggesting that L1 syntactic influence may only be evident when lexical processing is relatively automatic. Study 3 examined the effect of proficiency differences on processing outcomes by comparing performance by Intermediate and Advanced Japanese learners. The Intermediate learners showed no subject/object asymmetry in sentences with high frequency words, providing further evidence that processing efficiency is a key factor when considering possible L1 effects in L2 processing. Study 4 demonstrated that advanced L2 learners benefited from animacy cues in on-line processing, with the difficulty associated with object relative sentences and the L1 effect evident in sentences with animate head nouns neutralized in sentences with inanimate head nouns. The findings indicate that L2 learners may rely on lexical information as an alternative to syntactic knowledge in some cases. Finally, Study 5 compared processing performance on full or reduced relative clauses to examine both the influence of L1 syntactic properties and L1 structural frequency biases on L2 processing outcomes. Although the influence of frequency information was not evident, the results suggested that the availability of an overt relative marker in the L1 affected L2 processing outcomes. Overall, the results provide some support for the view that L1 background influences the processing of complex syntactic structures in the L2, a finding consistent with Juffs (2005) but contrary to Clahsen et al. (Clahsen &amp; Felser, 2006b). However, the effect is sensitive to a range of factors, which appears to support the claim by the latter that L2 learners may rely more on lexical-semantic information than L1 individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relative clause</field><field name="subject">syntactic processing</field><field name="subject">L1 transfer</field><field name="subject">L2 processing</field><field name="subject">working memory</field><field name="subject">second language acquisition</field><field name="subject">word recognition</field><field name="subject">proficiency</field><field name="subject">animacy</field><field name="subject">structural frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hartz revisited: German liberalism and the fragment cultures of 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland</field><field name="creator">Christopher Herde</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the nature of the relationship between migrants&#8217; ideology and the dominant political culture in their host country, exploring what happened to German liberal migrant politicians in 19th century Wisconsin and Queensland. It does this by using Louis Hartz&#8217;s fragment theory which he developed in The Liberal Tradition in America and The Founding of New Societies. Hartz argues that the crucial factor in the political development of the new settler new societies was the migration of a fragment of European society bound by a common Weltanschauung or world view. In the United States, Hartz identifies the relevant group as the Puritans who fled Britain in the 17th century, and whose Calvinism he links to Lockean liberalism. Hartz and his collaborator Richard Rosecrance, who wrote the Australian section of New Societies, argue Australia was shaped by the lower-middle and working-class migrant fragment, inspired by political reform movement in England, and who arrived in the first half of the 19th century armed with a utilitarian-radical ideology. With no strong opposition these fragments congeal without reference to Europe and stagnate into monolithic political cultures where all the disparate elements merge into a broad - although at times quarrelsome &#8211; national consensus. According to Hartz, this consensus is re-enforced by the individualist capitalism of The American Dream or the radical collectivism of The Australian Legend &#8211; which become the foundation of the two nations&#8217; respective national character. Hartz acknowledges that the new migrant from Europe is a constant threat to this political-cultural status quo. However, he says by &#8220;consciously articulating the fragment ethic&#8221;, the new migrant is absorbed, keeping in check the ideological challenges inherent in migration. This thesis argues that, in the case of the German liberals, who left their homeland in the 1840s and 1850s, the process was more complex than the one Hartz describes. In Wisconsin, German liberalism was most aligned to Jeffersonian democracy and the Germans either rejected outright or never fully embraced other strands within the political consensus such as Puritan moralism, Jacksonian democracy and Hamiltonian federalism. In Queensland their German liberalism was most compatible with utilitarianism and the Germans rejected most elements of classical liberalism, the evangelical element within social liberalism and the working-class radicalism of the Labor Party. They accepted Jeffersonian democracy and utilitarianism in their respective new homes because they were closest to their core German liberal principles of secularism, the primacy of the rule of law, romanticism, opposition to the aristocracy, and an aversion to rampant capitalism. Most important, however, were their attitudes towards the Staat and Volk. The Staat was both as a potential enemy and also a vital ally in liberal reform and the Volk were seen as potential colleagues in a liberal state but also as a danger to stability. Over the course of their careers they ideologically realigned, leaving parties and factions whenever challenged and using their German liberal ideals as their political reference point.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Louis Hartz, Queensland, Wisconsin, 19th century, US political culture, Australian political culture, fragment, German liberalism, migration, political history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chondrichthyans and the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery: Bycatch reduction, biology, conservation status and sustainability</field><field name="creator">Peter Kyne</field><field name="description">The chondrichthyan (shark, batoid and holocephalan) bycatch of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (ECTF) was examined through a series of fishery-independent trawl surveys, together with fishery-dependent (opportunistic) sampling. Project aims were to document the chondrichthyan bycatch composition in order to test the effectiveness of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), to examine biological aspects of bycatch species, and to combine data collected through these parts to assess the conservation status and sustainability of bycatch species. A total of 37 chondrichthyan species (one holocephalan, 19 batoids and 17 sharks) from 18 families were recorded in the bycatch of the fishery. The most speciose families recorded were the stingrays (Dasyatidae; 7 species), the requiem sharks (Carcharhinidae; 5 species), the catsharks (Scyliorhinidae; 4 species) and the stingarees (Urolophidae; 3 species). Chondrichthyan bycatch was highly variable between fishery sectors; catch rates were low in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector (north Queensland; 0.02&#8211;0.12 individuals ha-1 trawled) and in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector (southern Queensland; 0.08 individuals ha-1 trawled), intermediate in Hervey Bay (southern Queensland; 0.25 individuals ha-1 trawled) and in the scallop sector (central Queensland coast; 0.31 individuals ha-1 trawled) and highest in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector (southern Queensland; 0.96 individuals ha-1 trawled). Chondrichthyan bycatch in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector was dominated by the three batoids Aptychotrema rostrata, Trygonoptera testacea and Urolophus kapalensis (~92% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector by the skate Dipturus polyommata and the two catsharks Asymbolus rubiginosus and Figaro boardmani (~83% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the scallop sector by the three batoids A. rostrata, Neotrygon kuhlii and Neotrygon picta (~91% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), and in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector by the two batoids Himantura astra and Gymnura australis and the two sharks Chiloscyllium punctatum and Hemigaleus australiensis (~67% of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number). The testing of TEDs and BRDs, which are mandatory throughout the fishery, demonstrated only a limited ability to reduce chondrichthyan bycatch in the ECTF, which is comprised mainly of relatively small species. The shorter trawl durations of the surveys compared with normal commercial activities may have under-represented larger species. No significant reductions in chondrichthyan bycatch were found using a TED and a radial escape section BRD in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector, using a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD in the eastern king prawn (deepwater) sector, or using a TED and a fisheye BRD in Hervey Bay. There was however, a significant difference in the probability of capturing the group &#8216;sharks and guitarfishes&#8217; (comprised largely of A. rostrata) between codend types in the scallop sector, with the lowest probability of capture in nets fitted with both a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD (the difference was largely attributed to the effects of the TED). In the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector, in which three different BRDs were trialed (fisheye, square-mesh codend, square-mesh panel), the probability of capturing chondrichthyans was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD than in the standard (control) net, and the probability of capturing batoids was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD or with a square-mesh codend BRD than in the standard (control) net. The small sample size of chondrichthyan catches in some sectors may have reduced to power to detect bycatch reduction. The biology of several bycatch species from the families Rajidae, Rhinobatidae, Urolophidae and Scyliorhinidae was examined. For D. polyommata, size at birth was estimated at ~100&#8211;110 mm total length (LT), size at first feeding at ~105&#8211;110mm LT, size at 50% maturity (LT50 and 95% CI) at 321 (305&#8211;332) mm LT for females and 300 (285&#8211;306) mm LT for males. Diet (described by the index of relative importance as a percentage) was predominantly crustacean based, with carid shrimps (53.6%) and penaeoid prawns (23.3%) being the most significant prey groups. For A. rostrata, size at birth was estimated at &lt;170 mm LT, size at 50% maturity (LT50 and 95% CI) at 640 (618&#8211;663) mm LT for females and 597 (551&#8211;649) mm LT for males, and litter size was 9&#8211;20 (n = 9; mean &#177; S.E. = 15.1 &#177; 1.2). For T. testacea, size at birth was estimated at 77&#8211;100 mm disc width (WD), size at 50% maturity (WD50 and 95% CI) at 163 (156&#8211;169) mm WD for females and 146 (140&#8211;150) mm WD for males, and litter size was always one (n = 6). For U. kapalensis, size at birth was estimated at 75&#8211;100 mm WD, size at 50% maturity (WD50 and 95% CI) at 154 (145&#8211;160) mm WD for females and 155 (149&#8211;159) mm WD for males, and litter size was always one (n = 16). The catsharks A. analis, A. rubiginosus and F. boardmani were all confirmed as single oviparous species (carrying only one egg case in each uterus at one time). Ovarian fecundity (the number of vitellogenic follicles) averaged 13.6 (range 13&#8211;20) in A. analis, 13.5 (range 5&#8211;23) in A. rubiginosus and 10.4 (range 9&#8211;13) in F. boardmani. While only limited data were available from southern Queensland, several indicators suggest that Asymbolus catsharks are reproductively active year-round. A general lack of small-sized or immature catsharks captured during the study made assessments of size at maturity difficult for these species. The conservation status of ECTF bycatch species was examined through the application of the IUCN Red List of Threatened SpeciesTM Categories and Criteria, which considers extinction risk at the global level. Of the 24 ECTF chondrichthyan bycatch species evaluated against the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, four have been assessed globally as Vulnerable (a threatened category indicating that a species is &#8216;facing a high risk of extinction in the wild&#8217;), seven as Near Threatened, 11 as Least Concern and two as Data Deficient. While the four globally threatened species (A. nichofii, Heteroscyllium colcloughi, Rhynchobatus australiae and Urolophus sufflavus) were only minor components of the ECTF bycatch, their global conservation status warrants that fisheries management and industry should act to ensure minimal impacts on these species. An ecological risk assessment method (Susceptibility-Recovery Analysis) was used to assess the relative sustainability or risk of individual species to the fishing activities of the ECTF. Two separate approaches were taken to the technique, which considers sustainability to be dependent on the susceptibility of a species to the fishery and the recovery potential of a species after depletion by fishing activities. The first approach applied the precautionary principal when data were lacking for the calculation of recovery attributes, while the second used biological data from similar species when species-specific data were lacking. The precautionary approach tended to overestimate risk to poorly known oviparous species. The biological approach suggested that A. nichofii, F. boardmani, Rhizoprionodon acutus, Rhizoprionodon taylori and Rhynchobatus palpebratus face the least risk (i.e. were the most sustainable) while several medium-large batoids and the sharks Loxodon macrorhinus and Heteroscyllium colcloughi were the species most at risk (i.e. least sustainable). Demonstrating ecological sustainability of the ECTF will need to be a continued management objective into the future. To further improve the ecological sustainability of the fishery in relation to sharks, batoids and holocephalans, a number of management recommendations are proposed: (1) give warranted conservation consideration to listed threatened species as well as species identified as being at risk; (2) expand required logbook information on chondrichthyan species to include recording of catches of these species; (3) encourage safe release practices for all chondrichthyans to maximise survivorship of discards; (4) initiate research into the survivorship of discards; (5) ensure long-term observer coverage on commercial vessels to monitor bycatch levels; and, (6) test and quantify reduced TED bar spacings (presently 120 mm) in fishery sectors which show the highest chondrichthyan bycatch levels, that is, the eastern king prawn (shallow water) and scallop sectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bycatch</field><field name="subject">trawl</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyan</field><field name="subject">elasmobranch</field><field name="subject">turtle exclusion device</field><field name="subject">bycatch reduction device</field><field name="subject">ecological risk assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stromal Support of Erythropoiesis During Development</field><field name="creator">Simon Cridland</field><field name="description">Adult haematopoiesis occurs in the context of a supportive stromal cell niche. The bone marrow, spleen and thymus all contain specific, but relatively poorly defined, stromal cells, which are important for maintenance of quiescence and directed differentiation. Even less is known about the haematopoietic niche during haematopoietic development. The formation of red blood cells (erythropoiesis) occurs during haematopoiesis, and is also controlled by a variety of stromal cells. This thesis examined the visceral endoderm, a group of cells that surrounds the developing epiblast and is required for primitive erythropoiesis (early blood production). We attempted to determine which factors in the visceral endoderm were responsible for induction of primitive erythropoiesis, and whether they would be useful as blood induction factors in embryonic stem cell differentiation. Thus, I attempted to immortalise the visceral endoderm using an immortalising agent (SV40Tag), driven off of a previously identified visceral endoderm gene, Indian hedgehog. We modified a bacterial artificial chromosome so that SV40Tag was driven off of the Indian hedgehog gene. The modified bacterial artificial chromosome was used in both pronuclear injections of mouse blastocysts and the electroporation of embryonic stem cells. After neither attempt produced a visceral endoderm cell line, we examined a visceral endoderm-like cell line, END2, for the presence of the blood inducing factors. We demonstrated the ability of END2 conditioned media to apparently increase expression of blood transcripts in differentiating embryonic cells indicating the presence of blood inducing factors. Expression profiles of END2 cells were compared to a previously completed embryonic stem cell differentiation profile to identify enriched genes. Two genes, angiopoietin-like 7 and Bc064033, were tested for an ability to induce blood in differentiating embryonic stem cells. When neither protein was capable of inducing blood, the END2 cells were examined for the presence of other known blood inducing factors and similarity to in vivo visceral endoderm. The END2 cells were found to produce bone morphogenetic protein 4, a potent inducer of blood in embryonic stem cell differentiation, which complicated the search for additional factors. Examination of END2 cells also indicated a lack of visceral endoderm markers such as alpha fetoprotein, indicating that the END2 cells may not be as visceral endoderm-like as expected from the current literature. The previously identified Indian hedgehog gene was also examined for its blood induction abilities in vivo. Indian hedgehog knockout mice were examined for the effect gene removal had on both primitive and definitive erythropoiesis. Levels of primitive erythrocytes were unaffected in the Indian hedgehog knockout mice, but levels of definitive erythrocytes were found to be significantly decreased. Further examination of Indian hedgehog knockout fetal livers also showed that they had decreased numbers of haematopoietic stem cells. The haematopoietic stem cells were fully capable when cultured and generated appropriate numbers of progenitor cells, indicating a non-intrinsic cause for this defect. Levels of hedgehog target genes that are usually highest in the stromal compartment were also found to be most significantly decreased in Indian hedgehog knockout fetal livers. Another hedgehog gene, desert hedgehog, was also shown to be expressed in the fetal liver and may act with Indian hedgehog to regulate stromal production in the fetal liver.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">indian hedgehog</field><field name="subject">visceral endoderm</field><field name="subject">end2</field><field name="subject">angptl7</field><field name="subject">bco64033</field><field name="subject">definitive erythropoiesis</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acceptance and Use of the Service Oriented Computing Paradigm: the IT Professionals&#8217; Perspective</field><field name="creator">Ilse Baumgartner</field><field name="description">The thesis &#8220;Acceptance and use of the Service Oriented Computing paradigm: the IT professionals&#8217; perspective&#8221; focuses on the question: what are the critical factors that influence IT professionals&#8217; intentions to accept and use the Service Oriented Computing (SOC) approach to systems development? This work considers IT professionals as the key stakeholders in the SOC acceptance and use process and argues that the acceptance and practical use of SOC depends &#8211; at an early acceptance stage &#8211; primarily on the individual-level acceptance decisions made by senior IT professionals working for an organisation. Consequently, SOC acceptance and use (in its early stage) is seen as a bottom-up process driven, and to a high degree controlled, by the &#8220;early adopters&#8221; (Rogers 1995) of this technological paradigm (i.e. involved senior IT professionals). Although SOC is considered the enabling technological approach in many different future areas (e.g. eBusiness, eGovernment, eScience etc.), very little research exists on the process of practical acceptance of this paradigm, in particular focusing on the perspective of the &#8220;early stage&#8221; key stakeholders of this acceptance process, namely the IT professionals. This thesis consists of four major parts. First, it reviews existing literature on technology acceptance and use and confirms the absence of an established theoretical framework in the domain of individual-level technology acceptance in the IT industry. Second, based on data collected in a series of exploratory interviews with senior IT practitioners, an initial model explaining the acceptance and use of SOC among IT professionals is being proposed. Third, the derived model is revised and reformulated using an eGovernment case study. And forth, based on the refined model, a survey instrument is developed, pilot-tested and administered to senior IT professionals currently using the SOC approach to systems development in their professional work. This thesis makes a contribution to IS research in several ways. While there exists extensive, well-grounded and well-accepted research in the domain of &#8220;IT end-user&#8221; individual-level technology acceptance, the research on technology acceptance in the IT industry (i.e. technology acceptance by the IT professionals) is very limited, and nearly all studies carried out in this IS research field are concerned with established approaches or technologies. The current study is among the few examining the perspective of &#8220;early adopters&#8221; or &#8220;innovators&#8221; (Rogers 1995) instead of investigating the acceptance process of &#8220;early majority&#8221; or even &#8220;late majority&#8221;. Moreover, to the author&#8217;s knowledge it is the first study examining the process of individual-level SOC acceptance with a particular focus on the perspective of the &#8220;early stage&#8221; key stakeholders of this acceptance process, namely the IT professionals. One of the additional strengths of the study is the usage of multiple research methodologies &#8211; exploratory open-ended interviews, qualitative case study and web-based survey. This research is expected to be very interesting to researchers focusing on technology acceptance in general and on technology acceptance in the IT industry in particular. This research might also be of interest to IT practitioners considering to accept and use the SOC approach in their future applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">service oriented computing</field><field name="subject">individual-level technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">technology acceptance in the IT industry</field><field name="subject">SOC acceptance and use model</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adding gears to the RNA machine: discovery and characterisation of new classes of small RNAs in eukaryotes</field><field name="creator">Ryan Taft</field><field name="description">Genome sequencing has yielded unparalleled insights into fundamental biological processes and the genetics that guide them. In contrast to expectations that protein-coding genes would be the primary output of eukaryotic genomes, however, it is now clear that the vast majority of transcription is devoted to noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). Although originally regarded as 'transcriptional noise', it is now clear that these transcripts are essential regulators of genetic activity. In this thesis I build upon the hypothesis that the genomes of eukaryotes encode a regulatory 'RNA machine' dominated by ncRNAs. In the Introduction (Chapter 1) I discuss how prior gene models may have inadvertently prevented a full understanding of ncRNAs, review the transcriptional landscape of eukaryotes, and examine the biogenesis and function of small regulatory RNAs. In support of a role for ncRNAs in complex metazoa, Chapter 2 presents data showing a positive correlation between the proportion of non-protein-coding DNA and biological complexity, suggesting that the evolutionary trajectory of intricate developmental phenotypes may have been facilitated by ncRNAs. In the following chapters two more 'gears' are added to the RNA machine. Chapter 3 details the discovery of snoRNA-derived RNAs - an evolutionarily ancient class of Argonaute-assocaited RNA whose biogenesis overlaps with microRNAs (miRNAs) and silencing RNAs (siRNAs). Likewise, Chapter 4 reports a new class of ~18 nt transcription initiation RNAs (tiRNAs) derived from regions proximal to transcription start sites. tiRNAs are enriched at GC-rich promoters and regions of active transcription, implicating them in transcriptional regulation. Chapter 5 presents evidence that tiRNAs are restricted to metazoa, and describes a model of RNA Polymerase II dependent tiRNA biogenesis. This thesis concludes with a general discussion of the implications of these findings, and the potential development of RNA therapeutics. Gathering evidence suggests that eukaryotic genomes are driven by a complex and interwoven network of RNA regulatory feedback loops. This thesis takes a small step towards developing a complete picture of this system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">genome</field><field name="subject">noncoding DNA</field><field name="subject">noncoding RNA</field><field name="subject">microRNA</field><field name="subject">piRNA</field><field name="subject">silencing RNA</field><field name="subject">transcript initiation RNA</field><field name="subject">small nucleolar RNA</field><field name="subject">sno-derived RNA</field><field name="subject">evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190270</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and evaluation of a universal preventative web-based early intervention for children and their parents following accidental injury</field><field name="creator">Catherine Cox</field><field name="description">Accidental injury is a common experience for children (ABS, 2004-2005), yet the debilitating psychological effects of the trauma event often go undetected and thus not treated. Whilst for many the accident will result in some distress, many children will naturally recover and move on (Bryant, 2004). In spite of this, 10-18% of children will continue to experience persistent chronic stress symptoms for up to 2 years post accident (Le Brocque, Hendrikz, &amp; Kenardy, 2009). Unfortunately, little psychological assistance is available or offered to children that may assist in their psychological recovery and even prevent the significant and debilitating effects of psychological distress. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop and investigate an intervention for children following accidental injury. This was carried out via three stages and presented as three sections within the thesis. Section 1 aimed to develop a theory driven and evidenced-based intervention. Firstly, a meta-analysis was conducted to identify potential risk factors of significance that predict post-traumatic stress symptoms. This analysis resulted in pre-trauma psychopathology, threat to life, gender (female) and parental distress being relatively strong and consistent predictors. This information helps inform potential screening tools as well as directly guidinge the development of the intervention for this thesis. Secondly, this section conducted a comprehensive literature review of relevant approaches and interventions to help guide the development of the intervention. This review drew on models of traumatic stress development such as the Resilience Framework (Kumpfer, 1999), and Paediatric Medical Traumatic Stress (Kazak et al., 2006) as well as preventative frameworks such as the Paediatric Psychosocial Preventative Health Model (Kazak, 2006) that resulted in a Universal approach being argued as the most appropriate. Following this, a review was conducted of relevant universal preventative interventions currently available or recommended following trauma including, Psychological Debriefing (PD), Psychological First Aid (PFA) and information provision. Overall it was concluded that an information provision intervention that drew on strategies used within PD and PFA (such as normalisation and coping strategies) was the most appropriate and practical approach to offering psychological assistance to children and their parents following accidental injury. Finally, this section culminated in a chapter outlining the design, delivery and content of the intervention. The intervention developed aimed to normalise reactions and enhance coping in children following the accident whilst providing parents with accurate information regarding trauma reactions and how they could assist their child&#8217;s emotional recovery. Of importance was the decision to place the child&#8217;s intervention on the internet. It was argued that this would offer a more child friendly medium and provide greater and easier access for families. Section 2 encompassed the evaluation of the intervention developed. Children (7-16years) and their parents were recruited from the Royal Children&#8217;s Hospital and their trauma reactions were assessed over a 6 month period, with three assessment time points; Time 1 (baseline, within 1-2 weeks of the accident), Time 2 (4-6 weeks) and Time 3 (6 months). Children and their parents were randomised into the intervention group following Time 1. Analyses revealed that children within the intervention group reported significantly decreased anxiety, in comparison to a worsening of symptoms for children in the control group. No significant group differences were noted for the parents. Exploratory analysis conducted on high risk children (those with high initial distress) revealed that those in the control group exhibited a significant worsening of anxiety and social phobias over the 6 months. This significant increase in symptoms was not noted for children who had received the intervention. Furthermore, exploratory analyses revealed that children who initially reported high symptoms were the ones most likely to find the intervention helpful and effective. This result was exhibited in the qualitative responses from the parents and children. Overall, the intervention showed promise and encouraging results in its ability to aid child recovery. Furthermore, the results indicated that high risk children may benefit over and above all those recruited suggested the possible appropriateness for a stepped care approach. Section 3 was conducted in light of the results of Section 2, suggesting that children with high initial distress may benefit more greatly from the intervention compared to those with low initial distress. Therefore, this section examined a number of risk factors identified via the meta-analysis conducted in Section 1, to examine whether they would moderate a child&#8217;s and parent&#8217;s trauma symptoms following treatment compared with no treatment. Thus, this section investigated whether the intervention would be best delivered universally or targeted at children and parents who exhibited certain risk factors. Results indicated that when the child risk factors of initial child distress, attribution of self-blame and parental psychopathology were present, children in the control group had significantly higher trauma symptoms in comparison to those in the intervention. When these factors were not present, there were no significant group differences. For parents, their initial post-accident depression, anxiety and stress levels moderated treatment; in that when it was not present (low) there were no group differences, however when the risk factors was present (high) those in the control group exhibited significantly higher mood disturbances at 6 months. The findings of this section resulted in the conclusion that there are a number of risk factors that impact or influence treatment, thus suggesting that the intervention could be best utilised when targeted at those presenting with risk factors. Therefore, this research developed, investigated and optimised a universal preventative intervention for children and their parents following accidental injury. The limitations and implications for this research are discussed, including debate regarding a universal versus a targeted approach to intervention delivery.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accident, anxiety, trauma, children, web, universal, intervention, prevention, RCT</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Interferon-Induced Antiviral Protein MxA: Functional and Therapeutic Aspects Relating to Virus Infection</field><field name="creator">Antje Hoenen</field><field name="description">Our innate immunity is our first line of defence against pathogens. We require this immunity to control the numerous viral infections we are challenged with during our lives. However, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms of our innate immunity, particularly components that have specific antiviral potential. One potent mediator of this antiviral activity is the interferon system. Activation of the interferon system leads to the production of several interferon-induced proteins, which inhibit the multiplication of viruses by distinct mechanisms. A key example of one of these mediators is the human MxA protein. Human MxA has the capacity to inhibit many different viruses from diverse families. In many cases it is proposed that MxA interferes with key viral components, such as incoming or newly formed nucleocapsids. It is speculated that MxA traps and missorts these viral components so they are no longer available for virus production and virus dissemination is inhibited. West Nile virus belongs to Flaviviridae family of viruses and was involved in the outbreak of virus-associated encephalitis in New York City in 1999. In this thesis I show that West Nile virus is insensitive to antiviral activity of MxA and describe how West Nile virus has developed a replication strategy that avoids MxA recognition and activation. I show that virus-induced changes of cytoplasmic membranes provide a protective microenvironment for viral replication and the viral components essential for viral replication. This hypothesis was proven by preventing the formation of these membrane structures with the fungal chemical Brefeldin A. Under these conditions I observed that stable expression of MxA could partially restrict West Nile virus RNA replication. Subsequently, I showed that the assembly mechanism of West Nile virus prevents interaction between the MxA protein and the viral capsid proteins. This was achieved by the use of a trans-packaging cell line whereby the West Nile virus structural proteins are expressed stably in trans instead of in cis from the polyprotein. When this cell line was transfected with a West Nile virus replicon expressing the human MxA protein distinct co-localisation and redistribution of the MxA with West Nile virus capsid proteins into large tubular structures within the cytoplasm of transfected cells was observed. Strikingly, these tubular aggregates are visually analogous to structures observed during infection of MxA expressing cells infected with members of the Bunyaviridae, particularly La Crosse virus. Moreover, retargeting MxA to specific sites of the endoplasmic reticulum in cells transfected with the West Nile virus infectious clone resulted in co-localisation between MxA and the West Nile virus capsid proteins and significantly inhibited the production of infectious particles. These results suggest that the sequestering of viral capsids within cytoplasmic inclusions maybe a conserved mechanism for antiviral activity of the MxA protein across the viruses families and highlight the innate ability of such molecules to recognise key molecular patterns within pathogens. Finally, I sought to exploit the antiviral potential of MxA as a therapeutic agent against infection with Influenza A viruses; viruses that have a very high sensitivity for the antiviral activity of MxA. By expressing MxA from the West Nile virus replicon, infection with the highly pathogenic Influenza virus H5N1 strain could be inhibited in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo studies in Mx-negative mice indicated that intranasal inoculation with MxA expressed from the West Nile virus replicon can protect these mice against an otherwise lethal infection with a low pathogenic Influenza A virus. Taken all together, in this thesis I provide evidence that strongly supports the existence of an evolutionary working mechanism of a significant mediator of our immune system, the antiviral MxA protein. Furthermore, I show how an important human pathogen, such as West Nile virus has evolved a replication strategy to evade this antiviral protein. These results will open new pathways for the development of a new type of antiviral therapies that utilize the potent antiviral activity of the MxA protein.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MxA</field><field name="subject">Interferon</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Influenza A virus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary Australian Political Satire: Newspaper Cartoonists as Public Intellectuals</field><field name="creator">Amanda Roe</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the role that Australian graphic satirists play in the theatre of public life. The main focus of the thesis is on newspaper cartoonists but for the purposes of comparative analysis, there is a discussion of a representative selection of satiric texts across different media (essentially, television and radio) since the mid-1960s, and also an historical survey of the development of graphic satire from its origins during the Protestant Reformation in Europe. Apart from a small number of references, this study does not venture into the vast field of on-line satire, a topic more properly addressed in a separate scholarly investigation. Graphic satire in the medium of the newspaper is of particular interest because of its consistent production and wide circulation, its relative freedom from censorship and libel laws, and the ability of the cartoon image to condense and concentrate issues which would be too complex or defamatory in print or on television. Political cartooning as it is understood today emerged during the early nineteenth century, at about the same time as the modern newspaper and the profession of journalism, but graphic satire also has links with a venerable tradition of the artist as social critic and has historically been associated with movements for social justice and democracy. It is in the context of these latter associations that I consider political cartoonists as belonging to the sphere of the public intellectual. The discussion of cartoonists as public intellectuals is framed against a discourse of decline that has been circulating for more than a decade, acquiring an urgency in this country during the later years of the Howard administration. This declinist narrative covers a number of areas of cultural and political life and is not confined to the Australian context; as British writer Helen Small points out, it is &#8220;an increasingly transnational conversation&#8221; (02:1). Briefly outlined, there is a perception that the terms of public debate have narrowed; that citizens have become disengaged from the democratic process; that between the &#8216;celebrity intellectual&#8217; and the tenured academic, the life of the mind is not what it used to be, and even political satire itself has been seen by some commentators as being in terminal decline. The different arguments about cultural and social decline can be placed under the more encompassing subject heading of an ongoing debate about democracy and in particular, whether it is functioning as well as it should. With the adoption of neo-liberalism as an overarching political ideology by most western governments in the early 1980s, anxieties about whether the principles of democracy were gradually being usurped or even eroded by the primacy of market values have gathered momentum during the past two decades. The volume of these concerns has been amplified in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and the subsequent &#8216;war on terror&#8217;, with the state&#8217;s increased emphasis on security and control of its citizens being interpreted as threats to some of the basic tenets of the democratic system, such as free speech and the rule of law. In contrast to the various narratives of decline, my thesis proposes that democracy is still very well served by the kind of vigorous and long-standing practice of dissent that the public intellectual represents, and more specifically, the embodiment of this tradition in contemporary newspaper cartoonists. By definition, graphic satire questions and challenges the status quo and at least since Hogarth in the eighteenth century, it has always been a public art-form. Hogarth&#8217;s personal involvement in many of the social issues and philanthropic schemes of his day (such as anti-gin legislation and state care for orphans) also exemplifies an important aspect of the extra-professional work of graphic satirists which further links them to the public intellectual. A commitment to social activism and making use of the different platforms available (for example, public speaking and donating work to charities) in order to support, publicise or promote issues of social justice began with Hogarth and continues with contemporary Australian cartoonists.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian politics, satire, cartoonists, media, art history, public intellectuals, dissent, democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution, Development and Function of Proprioceptors in Larval Diptera</field><field name="creator">Jason Rice</field><field name="description">The evolution, development and function of the embryonic and larval peripheral nervous system (PNS) were investigated in a number of dipteran species, including Aedes aegypti, Hermetia pallescens, Lucilia cuprina, Bactrocera tryoni and Drosophila melanogaster. Comparative immuno-cytochemical data was generated for developmental proteins in the embryonic PNS and degenerative PCR was employed to identify homologous proneural genes amongst the species. Immunocytochemistry revealed aspects of sense-organ evolution amongst the Diptera, particularly an increase in sense-cell number and number of sensilla comprising proprioceptive organs in the crawling versus swimming larvae. The function of putative proprioceptive cells was investigated via mutant analysis and laser ablation. Results indicate that the multiple-dendrite (md) and bipolar-dendrite (bd) neurons contribute in a cumulative and roughly equal fashion to maintain peristaltic waves in crawling larvae.

World aquaculture production in 2006 was 51.7 million tonnes with an estimated value of US$ 78.8 billion (FAO, 2009). World production will need to increase however by 30-40 million tonnes from its current production level by 2030 to meet growing global demand for fish. In this context, aquaculture in Vietnam has developed rapidly over the past decade and the fisheries sector ranked fourth in terms of export value in 2008 (Vietnamnet, 2008). Total fisheries production in Vietnam in 2007 was 4.149 million tonnes, of which fisheries production from catch and aquaculture were 2.064 and 2.085 million tonnes, respectively. A variety of aquatic species are cultured in Vietnam, but shrimps (mainly Black Tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon, and Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei) and &#8216;tra&#8217; or &#8216;basa&#8217; catfish are the most common species used in aquaculture. The giant freshwater prawn (GFP), Macrobrachium rosenbergii, is one of the most important crustacean species in inland aquaculture in many countries across the world where this species is either native or exotic. GFP is suitable for culture in a variety of farming systems, including monoculture or polyculture in ponds, pens, and integrated or rotational rice-prawn culture models. The GFP industry worldwide relies totally on wild or unimproved stocks, a practice that threatens the long-term sustainability of GFP farming due to low productivity and vulnerability of farmed stocks to disease. The current status of GFP aquaculture highlights the need for initiation of a systematic stock improvement program for the species to improve economically important traits. Large-scale selective breeding programs have been instigated for some finfish, salmonids and GIFT tilapia for example, and some selective breeding trials have been conducted on crustacean species, namely marine penaeid shrimp and freshwater crayfish. Examples of selective breeding programs on aquatic species have demonstrated that significant genetic gains can be achieved for growth rates with gains of around 10-20% per generation. While a selective breeding program is an option for GFP stock improvement, an alternative approach to improving GFP productivity, potentially with more immediate effect and one that is less expensive, is crossbreeding which may produce heterosis or hybrid vigour in crossbred offspring. Therefore, a crossbreeding strategy was trialed in the current study as a starting point for a stock improvement program for the GFP industry in Vietnam. The current study assessed the growth performance of three GFP strains (two wild Vietnamese strains from the Dong Nai and Mekong rivers, and a single domesticated Hawaiian strain) and their reciprocal crosses in a complete 3x3 diallel cross, i.e. three purebred and six crossbred strains. The diallel cross was carried out over two consecutive generations (G1 and G2). Juveniles for the experiments were produced using single-pair matings. Juveniles from each strain combination were stocked into three replicate hapas for 15 weeks. Growth data (body weight, carapace length, standard length) from the G1 and G2 were pooled for all subsequent analyses as there was no effect of generation on growth traits. Results showed that the Hawaiian strain performed best among purebred strains, and crosses with the Dong Nai or Mekong strains as dams and the Hawaiian strain as sires grew significantly faster than did the purebred Dong Nai or Mekong strains. These results suggest potential for heterosis among some crosses. Growth data were analyzed in depth by partitioning the strain combination (cross) effect into three components: strain additive genetic effects, heterotic effects, and strain reciprocal effects. Strain additive genetic and reciprocal effects were significant sources of variation for all growth traits measured. Strain additive genetic effects were highest for the Hawaiian strain and lowest for the Mekong strain for all growth traits. Reciprocal effects influenced negatively on growth rate of crosses with the Hawaiian (H) strain as dams and the Dong Nai (D) or Mekong (M) as sires compared with their reciprocal crosses (DH and MH). Heterotic effects for all growth traits were small and not significantly different from zero (P &gt; 0.05). These results indicate that a crossbreeding approach based on the strains evaluated here provides only limited potential for improving growth rates based simply on heterotic outcomes and that a likely more productive option would be to trial artificial selection on a diverse synthetic stock. The current study also employed genetic markers (microsatellites) to characterize levels and patterns of genetic diversity in three purebred strains of GFP that originated from the diallel cross above. All three purebred strains showed relative high levels of genetic diversity in terms of allele number and individual heterozygosity across the six marker loci screened. Levels of genetic diversity present in the three purebred strains combined into a single stock were compared with that from a combination of three wild river stocks to assess the impact of domestication on genetic diversity of a &#8216;synthetic&#8217; population. Results demonstrated that there was no significant loss of genetic diversity in the three purebred strains combined compared with a reference set containing the three wild populations. Therefore, a synthetic population formed from these purebred strains successfully captured the majority of genetic variation present in the wild broodstock. This synthetic population provides a potential stock for a future selective breeding program for GFP in Vietnam. The current study was also the first attempt to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key growth genes in GFP. Two key candidate genes were targeted, actin and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), that are potentially linked to growth performance in GFP. The study screened SNPs in GFP females only, because growth performance of GFP males is influenced strongly by social rank. The study identified four SNPs in intron 3 of the CHH gene that were significantly correlated with individual body weight at harvest, while no SNPs detected in the actin gene were associated with growth traits in GFP. This finding however, needs to be confirmed using larger sample sizes and other GFP lines. The current study has produced important basic knowledge relevant to implementation of an effective stock improvement program for GFP in Vietnam. Results indicate that a selective breeding strategy rather than a crossbreeding approach is likely to be the best strategy for improving GFP culture stocks in Vietnam. In addition, the study demonstrates that application of modern molecular genetic technologies can be efficient in developing a genetically diverse, synthetic population for stock improvement and for identifying potential markers correlated with important commercial traits in GFP. Integration of DNA techniques with traditional breeding practices can facilitate GFP stock improvement in Vietnam and accelerate the industry development when improved lines are available. Some limitations of the current study and recommendations for further work are discussed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, diallel cross, heterosis, growth traits, selective breeding, microsatellite, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), Vietnam</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:190728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating Sequence and Structure for Annotating Proteins in the Twilight Zone: A Machine Learning Approach</field><field name="creator">Isye Arieshanti</field><field name="description">Determining protein structure and function experimentally is both costly and time consuming. Transferring function-related protein annotations based on homology-based methods is relatively straightforward for proteins that have sequence identity of more than 40%. However, there are many proteins in the "twilight zone" where sequence similarity with any other protein is very weak, while being structurally similar to several. Such cases require methods that are capable of using and exploiting both sequence and structural similarity. To understand ways of how such methods can and should be designed is the focus of this study. In this thesis, models that use both sequence and structure features are applied on two protein prediction problems that are particularly challenging when relying on sequence alone. Enzyme classification benefits from both kinds of features because on one hand, enzymes can have identical function with limited sequence similarity while on the other hand, proteins with similar fold may have disparate enzyme class annotation. This thesis shows that the full integration of protein sequence and structure-related features (via the use of kernels) automatically places proteins with similar biological properties closer together, leading to superior classification accuracy using Support Vector Machines. Disulfide-bonds link residues in a protein structure, but may appear distant in sequence. Sequence similarity reflecting such structural properties is thus very hard to detect. It is sufficient for the structure to be similar for accurate prediction of disulfide-bonds, but such information is very scarce and predictors that rely on protein structure are not nearly as useful as those operating on sequence alone. This thesis proposes a novel approach based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis that uses structural features during training only. It does so by finding sequence representations that correlate with structural features that are essential for a disulfide bond. The resulting representations enable high prediction accuracy for a range of disulfide-bond problems. The proposed model thus taps the advantage of structural features without requiring protein structure to be available in the prediction process. The merits of this approach should apply to a number of open protein structure prediction problems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sequence analysis, kernel canonical correlation analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:191113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple Versions and Overlap in Digital Text</field><field name="creator">Desmond Schmidt</field><field name="description">This thesis is unusual in that it tries to solve a problem that exists between two widely separated disciplines: the humanities (and to some extent also linguistics) on the one hand and information science on the other. Chapter 1 explains why it is essential to strike a balance between study of the solution and problem domains. Chapter 2 surveys the various models of cultural heritage text, starting in the remote past, through the coming of the digital era to the present. It establishes why current models are outdated and need to be revised, and also what significance such a revision would have. Chapter 3 examines the history of markup in an attempt to trace how inadequacies of representation arose. It then examines two major problems in cultural heritage and lin- guistics digital texts: overlapping hierarchies and textual variation. It assesses previously proposed solutions to both problems and explains why they are all inadequate. It argues that overlapping hierarchies is a subset of the textual variation problem, and also why markup cannot be the solution to either problem. Chapter 4 develops a new data model for representing cultural heritage and linguistics texts, called a &#8216;variant graph&#8217;, which separates the natural overlapping structures from the content. It develops a simplified list-form of the graph that scales well as the number of versions increases. It also describes the main operations that need to be performed on the graph and explores their algorithmic complexities. Chapter 5 draws on research in bioinformatics and text processing to develop a greedy algorithm that aligns n versions with non-overlapping block transpositions in O(M N ) time in the worst case, where M is the size of the graph and N is the length of the new version being added or updated. It shows how this algorithm can be applied to texts in corpus linguistics and the humanities, and tests an implementation of the algorithm on a variety of real-world texts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">overlapping hierarchies</field><field name="subject">textual variation</field><field name="subject">multiple sequence alignment</field><field name="subject">textual criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:191374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Volatile Sulphur Compounds in UHT Milk</field><field name="creator">Al-Attabi, Zahir</field><field name="description">Heating milk to high temperatures such as 140 &#186;C, as used in ultra high temperature (UHT) processing, causes physical and chemical changes in the milk. The production of a cooked flavour is a major change which reduces consumer acceptance of the UHT milk. It has been correlated with the formation of volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) that result from milk proteins, principally the whey proteins &#946;-lactoglobulin, containing the the sulphur amino acids cystine, cysteine and methionine. The VSCs in milk, whose concentrations are in the parts per billion to parts per million range, are highly reactive, easily oxidised, and sensitive to heat during thermal processing and analysis; this makes them a challenge to analyse. A sensitive method based on gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection coupled with headspace sampling by solid phase microextraction (SPME/GC/PFPD) was developed to detect these compounds in commercial UHT milk and to investigate their production and disappearance during heating and storage. The SPME/GC/PFPD procedure was optimised using different extraction time (15 min, 30 min, &amp; 60 min) &#8211; temperature (30 oC, 45 oC &amp; 60 oC) combinations with CAR/PDMS fibre to obtain maximum sensitivity. A short extraction time (15 min) at low temperature (30 oC) was chosen to provide high sensitivity for detecting all VSCs in UHT milk without introducing artefactual VSCs. The extraction method and GC run time (16 min) make this method simple and fast. Nine VSCs were detected in commercial indirectly processed UHT milk, skim and whole. These are hydrogen sulphide (H2S), carbonyl sulphide (COS), methanethiol (MeSH), dimethyl sulphide (DMS), carbon disulphide (CS2), dimethyl disulphide (DMDS), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), dimethyl sulphone (Me2SO2) and dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS). An additional unknown compound was detected but could not be identified by GC/MS because its concentration was below the detection limit of the MS detector. The concentrations of H2S, DMS and DMTS were higher than their threshold values indicating their importance in milk flavour, especially cooked flavour. Several attempts have been made to reduce the cooked flavour in UHT milk. In the current research, the use of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to oxidise the VSCs and thereby reduce cooked flavour was investigated. H2O2 is used as a milk preservative and is generally recognised as safe (GRAS) in USA. Several concentrations of H2O2 (0.001%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.02% &amp; 0.03%) were added to milk to assess its effects on VSCs and on whey proteins denaturation in UHT milk. H2O2 effectively reduced the concentration of all VSCs, except DMDS which was increased, presumably by oxidation of MeSH. H2S was completely oxidised or reduced below its threshold value. Low concentrations of H2O2 (0.001% &amp; 0.005%) had no effect on, or decreased, the extent of denaturation of &#946;-lactoglobulin when added after or before processing, respectively. Some UHT plants use severe heating conditions, leading to high levels of denaturation of whey proteins, particularly &#946;-Lg, the main source of the VSCs in milk. Correlations between heat severity, &#946;-Lg denaturation and individual VSC generation were investigated in milk batch-heated at 80 oC and 90 oC, and UHT milk processed at 120-150 oC. In accordance with previous reports, &#946;-Lg was more heat-sensitive than &#945;-La. Only five VSCs were detected. The concentrations of H2S and MeSH correlated well with denaturation of &#946;-Lg and &#945;-La. DMS concentration correlated well with &#946;-Lg in UHT milk but not in the batch-heated milk. CS2 did not show a good correlation with heat intensity and appeared to plateau out after a certain level of heating. Conversely, COS and MeSH seemed to require a certain minimum amount of heat before generation commenced; this corresponded to denaturation of &#946;-Lg above 49% and 89% respectively at 80 oC. The higher concentrations of DMS and H2S in UHT milk compared with batch-heated samples having similar degrees of denaturation suggested other possible sources for their production and the importance of the heat severity in generating them. For example, at high heat intensity, S-methylmethionine and thiamine could be sources of DMS and H2S respectively. Furthermore, in whole milk as used in this work, milk fat globule membrane proteins are another source of VSCs. The outcome of this study will help UHT manufacturers to understand the production and disappearance of the VSCs in commercial UHT milk and how to adjust the processing conditions to avoid generation of cooked flavour. Additionally, the promising results of using low concentrations of H2O2 to oxidise the VSCs will provide the industry with another means of reducing cooked flavour. Before H2O2 use is implemented in UHT processing, future studies are required to evaluate all of its effects, including sporicidal effects. Overall, this study makes a contribution to finding a solution to the cooked flavour problem in UHT milk, thereby increasing market share of this milk in countries such as Australia, the UK and North America where cooked flavour is the main barrier to its consumer acceptance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">UHT milk, cooked flavour, volatile sulphur compounds, solid phase microextraction, pulsed flame photometric detector, hydrogen peroxide, heat severity, &#946;-lactoglobulin</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropsychological Assessment of Recovery after Mild Traumatic Brain Injury</field><field name="creator">Karleigh Kwapil</field><field name="description">Mild Traumatic Brain injury (mTBI) is one of the most common forms of acquired neurological damage. However, the term 'mild' TBI is misleading because the physical, cognitive and emotional impairments that can follow from mTBI can be significant. In order to provide objective, prognostic measures for diagnosing the severity of mTBI and identifying individuals who may be at risk for poor outcomes a battery of neuropsychological measures for detecting cognitive impairment was evaluated. The Rapid Screen of Concussion (RSC) is a collection of tests assessing verbal recall, orientation, processing speed and speed of language comprehension. Previous studies have demonstrated that the RSC has acceptable reliability, validity and sensitivity to cognitive impairment that arises during the acute stages of injury. However, no studies have investigated the predictive validity of this instrument. Moreover it is unclear what additional patient or post injury variables could assist in identifying those individuals who may be at risk of poor neuropsychological outcomes following mTBI. These were among the main issues that were addressed across the five empirical studies in this thesis. A pragmatic, prospective, longitudinal and cross-sectional study of the sequelae of mTBI in patients presenting to the Department of Emergency Medicine of the Royal Brisbane and Women's hospital was the basis of this project. The first empirical chapter (chapter 2), examined the psychometric properties of two measures of verbal learning and memory and investigated their potential for discriminating between mTBI and orthopaedic controls. The performance of 93 patients with mTBI and 68 participants with orthopaedic injuries was analysed to identify the number of individuals who performed at ceiling on the Hopkins Verbal Learning test (HVLT-R) versus a 5-word test of immediate and delayed recall. While both of these verbal recall measures were effective in separating the mTBI and orthopaedic groups, overall, the HVLT-R was shown to be a more suitable measure for screening for deficits in verbal learning and memory after mTBI. Given the superiority of the HVLT-R as a measure of verbal learning and memory, chapter 3 aimed to examine whether inclusion of this test could improve the sensitivity of the RSC in mTBI compared to orthopaedic and uninjured control samples. Results were generally within the direction predicted. Significant differences were found between groups on the majority of cognitive indices assessed. Both the orthopaedic and mTBI group performed more poorly than the uninjured group on all measures except the Hopkins delayed recognition. Additional performance decrements shown by the mTBI group compared to the orthopaedic group illustrate that factors beyond the general effects of trauma influence performance and may be related to cognitive impairment specific to sustaining mTBI. Overall it was concluded that the revised RSC is a sensitive instrument deserving investigation in assessing the more long term cognitive effects following mTBI. Chapter 4 applied this sensitive battery for investigation of group and individual recovery of neuropsychological test performance and post-concussive symptom reporting up to 3-months after mTBI. A sample of 30 mTBI participants and 30 uninjured controls were serially assessed on cognitive measures and symptom report scales immediately after injury and after 1-week, 1-month and 3-months. Symptom reporting on the Rivermead post-concussive inventory separated the mTBI and control groups after 1-week but diagnostic accuracy was no greater than chance at 1 and 3-months. In contrast the mTBI group performed more poorly than controls on measures on neuropsychological measures acutely, at 1-week and 1-month, with group differences still evident after 3-months. Nonethless, a trend of progressive recovery over time was seen in the mTBI group. In chapter 5, criteria utilising the concepts of reliable and statistically significant change were applied to the data. Overall, 73% of mTBI patients were impaired on one or more tests acutely. Significant recovery was demonstrated by 20% of mTBI participants by 3-months; however recovery remained incomplete for half of the mTBI participants by 3-months. These results highlighted the importance of an individual approach to the assessment of mTBI and support the notion that a proportion of mTBI cases may have protracted difficulties. Chapter 6 extended these findings by showing that the RSC has prognostic ability. It was found that acute neuropsychological performance on the RSC was a significant predictor of performance on an extended battery at 3-months. The final chapter provides a general discussion and synthesis of the findings. In summary, the present dissertation demonstrated that inclusion of a sensitive measure of verbal recall led to improved diagnostic validity of the RSC. Neuropsychological measures rather than symptom reporting were sensitive in detecting cognitive impairment at 3-months. Analysis of individuals showed that up to 50% of the group had failed to &#8211; demonstrate reliable recovery &#8211; that is, make improvements over and above practice effects after 3-months. Finally, acute neuropsychological performance was predictive of long term performance. Overall, the present thesis has identified a short battery of tests that is suitable for assessment of mTBI within 24 hours and may assist in identifying individuals at risk of poor cognitive outcomes after mTBI.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mild traumatic brain injury</field><field name="subject">Concussion</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological assessment</field><field name="subject">neuropsychological recovery</field><field name="subject">post concussion syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Substrate, Inhibitor, and Mutational Studies of the Human Adrenaline Synthesising Enzyme Phenylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase</field><field name="creator">Nyssa Drinkwater</field><field name="description">Abstract The enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) catalyses the biosynthesis of adrenaline. Although adrenaline is a significant central nervous system (CNS) neurotransmitter, and has been associated with various physiological processes such as the control of blood pressure and the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, its exact role in the CNS is unclear. As part of an international collaborative effort, this project aimed to develop PNMT inhibitors suitable for probing the role of CNS adrenaline, and to generate novel drug leads. Towards the goal of developing potent and selective PNMT inhibitors, this thesis utilised three general approaches. The first approach involved classical structure-guided drug discovery using X-ray crystallography, and is described in Chapter 2. Characterisation of the PNMT pharmacophore provided results that led to a new understanding of how PNMT recognises inhibitors. Structures described in this thesis revealed a cryptic binding pocket that is only revealed on binding of inhibitors that were predicted to be too large to interact with PNMT. The findings therefore demonstrated an extraordinary degree of flexibility inherent to the PNMT binding pocket, and emphasise the need to include greater protein flexibility in inhibitor design strategies. Secondly, this thesis investigated the catalytic mechanism of PNMT, described in Chapters 3 and 4. This research characterised the binding of substrates to wild type and variant PNMT, including the physiological substrate noradrenaline, and model substrates as well as substrate-analogue inhibitors of the enzyme. PNMT catalyses the methylation of a range of substrates. However, differential substitutions to these substrates can dictate the ligand binding position and thereby determine whether methyl transfer will occur. Additionally, the results provided new lessons for the routine use of point mutations in the study of enzymes, because changes are not always simply an indication of the difference in the residue functionality. I found, for example, that single site mutations can induce large movements in enzyme. Therefore structural characterisation of enzyme variants is an important addition to kinetic studies to enable a comprehensive examination of catalytic function. Finally, I have implemented a fragment based screening (FBS) approach to the discovery of novel lead compounds that inhibit PNMT, described in Chapters 5 and 6. The FBS approach has many advantages over existing drug discovery methods including higher hit rates, higher efficiency hits, and the ability to sample a larger range of chemical space. This thesis describes the application of FBS by X-ray crystallography to PNMT. The approach was used to screen a library of 384 compounds yielding 12 novel PNMT fragment leads. Furthermore, chemical elaboration and kinetic evaluation of these hits was performed in Chapter 7. In summary, this thesis has made a significant contribution to our understanding of the chemistry, kinetics and structure of PNMT. This understanding will be important in ongoing efforts to develop potent, selective, and CNS-active inhibitors of the enzyme.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methyltransferase</field><field name="subject">Catalysis</field><field name="subject">Inhibitor</field><field name="subject">Drug Design</field><field name="subject">Fragment</field><field name="subject">Crystallography</field><field name="subject">Biochemical Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Flexibility</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPING A SENSE OF SELF: EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION OF IMMUNE AND ALLORECOGNITION MECHANISMS IN METAZOANS USING THE DEMOSPONGE AMPHIMEDON QUEENSLANDICA</field><field name="creator">Marie Gauthier</field><field name="description">All animals have evolved mechanisms to recognise and eliminate nonself in order to defend against invading pathogens and to prevent chimerism, the fusion between genetically distinct conspecifics. Like other metazoans, sponges are known to rely on sophisticated systems to maintain their self-integrity. As poriferans are also considered one of the most ancient extant metazoan phyla, they represent a critical comparative model for understanding the early evolution of immunity and self/nonself recognition in animals. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling cascade plays a crucial role in immunity, and recent findings in the sponge Suberites domuncula suggest that its origin could predate eumetazoan cladogenesis. My genome and expressed sequence tag (EST) screens of the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica detected homologues to most components of this pathway, supporting the notion that a primordial TLR signalling cascade emerged at the dawn of the Metazoa. The sponge also encodes a couple of putative TLR-related proteins (AmqIgTIRs) that consist of at least one extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig) and an intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor/resistance (TIR) domain. The presence of other unconventional TLRs in S. domuncula and in cnidarian representatives, implies that an ancestral TLR probably existed in the last common ancestor of all living metazoans, and independent duplication and divergence events led to the variety of forms observed in animals. Among the putative transcription factors present in Amphimedon, which are known to be activated by the TLR signalling cascade in other eumetazoans, I detected a single member of the Rel/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#954;B) family, AmqNF-&#954;B, which is also the only Rel homology domain (RHD)-containing gene present in the sponge. This gene encodes a protein that is equipped with both a RHD and ankyrin (ANK) repeats, suggesting that the ancestral metazoan NF-&#954;B was configured identically to contemporary vertebrate and sponge forms, and that the truncated NF-&#954;B found in Nematostella vectensis resulted from the secondary loss of ANK. Aside from immunity, the Toll and TLR pathways contribute to a variety of biological processes in bilaterians, however their functions have only been investigated in detail in a limited number of metazoan model organisms. While studies have tested the immune role of various sponge genes, including components of the TLR cascade, no research has yet established whether they are also involved in development. Therefore, I investigated the expression of some of the immunity-related genes I isolated in Amphimedon in a developmental and immune context to shed light on the potential ancestral function(s) of the proteins they encode. Using in situ hybridisation, I demonstrate that AmqIgTIR2, AmqMyD88, AmqTollip, AmqPellino and AmqNF-&#312;B are expressed during A. queenslandica early development. In contrast, the spatial and temporal expression of AmqIgTIR1 suggests it might encode a receptor that is specifically involved in the detection of metamorphic cues in larvae. A real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) study performed on a pool of adult sponge cDNAs indicates that the expression levels of AmqIgTIR1, AmqIgTIR2, AmqMyD88 and AmqTollip are significantly affected by a nine-hour incubation in 50 &#181;g/ml of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and to a lesser extent by 105 colony forming units (cfu)/ml of live Vibrio harveyi. The gene expression of AmqIgTIR1 and AmqIgTIR2 suggests that they may encode proteins with antagonistic immunological functions. While AmqPellino and AmqNF-&#312;B do not appear to be affected by LPS and Vibrio exposure, it is possible that these genes do not participate in the early immune response of poriferans. Together, my data indicate that the sponge genes surveyed might encode proteins that perform developmental, sensory and immunological functions, suggesting their roles could have also been multifaceted in the last common ancestor to all living metazoans. As is observed in other invertebrates, poriferans display an ontogenic shift in allorecognition; genetically different individuals can fuse during early development but, in most instances, not as adults. However, there is a limited understanding of the cellular organisation of sponge chimeras and the onset of poriferan allorecognition response. By following the fates of fluorescently tagged cells derived from genetically distinct Amphimedon larvae that are fused together at metamorphosis, I establish that there is a rapid ontogenic shift in the sponge allogeneic response about two weeks after the initiation of metamorphosis. Moreover, the molecular basis of the poriferan allorecognition system is possibly involved in creating differential cell affinities, which underlie the construction of the sponge body plan. Compatible with this scenario is the observation that cells from postlarvae that are allowed to develop for two weeks before contact do not fuse, and form a distinct boundary between genotypes. The molecules responsible for sponge cell reaggregation, the aggregation factors (AFs), have been proposed to drive the allorecognition response in poriferans. Notably, the Amphimedon genome encodes six putative AFs, of which five occur in a cluster. These findings indicate that the polymorphic variation observed in other poriferan AFs is probably the result of allelic variations of multiple genes belonging to the same family.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porifera</field><field name="subject">evolution of metazoan immunity</field><field name="subject">allorecognition</field><field name="subject">aggregation factor</field><field name="subject">Toll-like receptor</field><field name="subject">in-situ hybridisation</field><field name="subject">nuclear factor-kappaB</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scottish Friction, Scottish Fiction: The F(r)ictions of James Kelman</field><field name="creator">Kirsty Brash</field><field name="description">The fictions of James Kelman are most intriguing when read in terms of the frictions they reveal. This thesis defines these frictions and uses theories of exile, postcoloniality, nationalism, space and the &#8220;ordinary&#8221; in order to elucidate them. Kelman&#8217;s career has been fraught with tensions born of a troubled relationship with the British literary establishment. Kelman puts this down to the censorship and elitism he believes define that establishment, and his self-confessed refusal to conform to its expectations. This thesis considers the perception of exile that has become the vantage point from which he has written about the lives of marginalised characters and through which he deconstructs Scottish identity and the plight of the Glaswegian working classes. This thesis focuses on three of Kelman&#8217;s finest works of fiction: How Late It Was, How Late (1994), A Disaffection (1989) and The Busconductor Hines (1984), each of which was written in the period between Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s taking office in 1979 and Scotland&#8217;s successful devolution in 1997. This period has proved to be a defining one for Scotland and its latter years have been marked by the development of a newly confident sense of Scottish identity which rejects English hegemony as well traditionally parochial notions of Scottishness. This has informed, and been informed by, a new movement within Scottish literature that seeks to relaunch Scottish culture through a rejection of both past frustrations and &#8220;couthie&#8221; representations of Scotland in favour of more productive explorations of wider human concerns. This thesis makes a case for the key role Kelman has played in this shift, and challenges the widely held perception that his work does little more that mourn a past way of life and expose a relentlessly bleak present.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">british literature</field><field name="subject">scottish literature</field><field name="subject">james kelman</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Nickel-Chelating Fluorinated Lipids for Membrane Protein Monolayer Crystallisations</field><field name="creator">Waleed Hussein</field><field name="description">Abstract 3D crystallisation of membrane proteins presents a bottleneck for the determination of the structures of membrane proteins. Obtaining 3D crystals of membrane proteins is made difficult by a number of factors including the poor solubility and instability of membrane proteins outside of their native membrane environment. 2D crystallisation of membrane proteins offers an alternative to preserve the conformational structure and functional activities of membrane proteins within their native bilayer membranes in 2D arrays from which the structure of membrane proteins can be determined. Different techniques exist for obtaining 2D crystals of membrane proteins including surface crystallisation or more commonly 2D crystallisation by detergent removal (using either dilution, dialysis, hydrophobic resin adsorption or cyclodextrin complexation) to promote reconstitution of the protein molecules within bilayer-forming lipids. Another method which has been emerged and is being used increasingly is the lipid monolayer technique for 2D crystallisation of proteins. The use of lipid monolayers to bind and adsorb proteins is an attractive and increasingly important method for generating high localised concentrations of oriented proteins and protein complexes. These bound proteins can be imaged directly, or they may form 2D crystalline arrays that are amenable to structure determination by single particle analysis or 2D electron crystallography. 2D crystals grown by this technique can also be used to initiate the growth of 3D crystals for X-ray diffraction analysis. Many derivatised lipids have been prepared for use with this technique, incorporating a diverse range of ligands to enable binding to specific proteins. Synthetic lipids containing functionalised head groups that chelate Ni2+ or Cu2+ have also been prepared to bind and orient expressed proteins that contain His-tags. Protein-binding monolayer-forming lipids generally consist of two distinct components: (1) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity to the monolayer and (2) a functionalised hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of protein molecules at the air-water interface. Newer examples of these compounds also incorporate perfluorinated hydrocarbon moieties to confer detergent resistance to these lipids. The present work discusses the chemistry of all these functionalised lipids and their contributions to monolayer 2D protein crystallisation. This thesis focuses on the synthesis of novel nickel-chelating fluorinated lipids to be used as a template for 2D crystallisation of His-tagged membrane proteins at the air/water interface. These monolayer-forming lipids have been designed with three distinct components: (i) a branched hydrocarbon tail to confer fluidity of the monolayer, (ii) a perfluorinated central core for detergent resistance, and (iii) a nickel-chelating hydrophilic head group to facilitate binding of recombinant, polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins. Alkylations of fluorinated alcohols used in these syntheses proceed in good yields only with the application of prolonged sonication and, in some cases, in the presence of phase-transfer catalysts. Biophysical properties of Langmuir monolayers formed by our target synthetic fluorinated lipids were studied, comparing the results obtained with those of DOPC and DOGS Ni-NTA as examples of non fluorinated lipids. The Langmuir films were characterised by surface pressure-area isotherms and X-ray reflectometry to show their fluidity, thickness and packing density. The stability of fluorinated lipid monolayers and their ability to resist the solubilisation effects of a number of detergents were investigated using monolayer and affinity grid techniques. Results showed that fluorinated lipids offer an improved resistance to the solubilisation effects of detergents compared with their non-fluorinated counterparts. A number of trials for 2D crystallisation of both soluble and membrane proteins have been performed using fluorinated lipid monolayers. These new synthetic fluorinated lipids were successfully used to obtain 2D crystals of the His-tagged membrane protein BmrA from Bacillus subtillis by the monolayer technique.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">fluorinated lipids</field><field name="subject">monolayer</field><field name="subject">self-assembly proteins</field><field name="subject">2D crystallisation</field><field name="subject">electron microscopy</field><field name="subject">membrane proteins</field><field name="subject">tagged proteins</field><field name="subject">detergent resistant</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:192988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Commentary</field><field name="creator">Ian Cresswell</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RIPARIAN GROUNDWATER FLOW AND SALT TRANSPORT IN AQUIFER-ESTUARY INTERACTION</field><field name="creator">Mothei Lenkopane</field><field name="description">Estuarine ecosystems are under enormous stress due to rapid coastal developments and climate change. Proper management of these important ecosystems requires a good understanding of their key processes. In this thesis, riparian groundwater-surface water interaction is explored for an aquifer-estuary system primarily by a series of numerical experiments. The work focuses on riparian-scale groundwater flow and salinization. The overall aim of the study was to extend our understanding of aquifer-estuary exchange, which is currently centered on the lower marine estuarine reach, to middle estuaries (i.e., the estuary reach that has variable salinity). The numerical experiments were guided by previous studies and observations made from an exploratory field investigation conducted in and next to Sandy Creek, a macro-tidal estuary incised in the alluvial aquifer of the Pioneer Valley, North-eastern Australia (Longitude 49.11&#176;, Latitude -21.27&#176;). The following observations were made from the field investigation: Sandy Creek estuary experiences a variable salinity regime in its mid reaches that consists of periods of 1) freshwater flushing due to up catchment-derived flooding, 2) persistent freshwater conditions for at least 2 months following the flooding, 3) tidal salinity fluctuations and 4) constant near-seawater salinity; laterally extensive and disconnected aquitards were found to occur at the field site; Sandy Creek had an essentially &#8216;vertical&#8217; bank slope. Numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element modeling code FEFLOW for saturated unsaturated, variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport, to examine the influence of the following factors on aquifer-estuary exchange: a tidally varying estuarine salinity and hydraulic head, a seasonal freshwater flush (i.e., estuary with freshwater and an elevated stage due to an up catchment sourced flood), near estuary aquitard layers, lateral asymmetry (about the estuary centerline) in hydraulic conductivity and regional hydraulic gradients. The simulations neglected seepage face development after numerical experiments showed that for a vertical bank estuary interacting with a sandy loam aquifer, seepage face effects on groundwater flow and associated salinity distribution were minimal. The following observations were drawn from the range of numerical experiments considered. Tidal salinity fluctuations in the estuary (varying between 0 and 1 - i.e., using a relative salinity scale where a salinity of 1 is seawater) produced flow paths and residence times that were distinctly different to the constant seawater salinity case. While the constant average 0.5 salinity case and the corresponding tidally-varying salinity case (i.e., salinity varying between 0 and 1) produced somewhat comparable results in terms of RUC and RLC (RUC represents groundwater discharge to the estuary that originated from recharge to the estuary bank and RLC groundwater discharge to the estuary that originated from recharge through the estuary bed), whereas flow paths and the total salt mass in the aquifer differed. Freshwater flushing simulations indicated that the near-estuary aquifer responds rapidly to a 2-day &#8216;wet season&#8217; flushing event with a short-lived freshwater lens created through freshening of the hyporheic zone. Annual cycling of the seasonal flushing led to significant disruption of the estuary water circulation in the aquifer thereby impacting on residence times, transport pathways, and RUC and RLC, and acting to potentially remobilize groundwater and contaminants previously trapped in continuous and semi-continuous re-circulation cells. Although groundwater flow paths determined using tide-averaged velocity vectors were representative of flow paths from transient tidally driven flow vector field, residence times calculated from the two flow fields were markedly different. The influence of riparian scale aquitards and lateral asymmetry (about the estuary centreline) in hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivity on groundwater flow and associated salinity distribution was also found to be sensitive to estuarine salinity conditions. The results indicate that observations made about aquifer-estuary interaction in the lower estuary may not be directly applicable to the middle estuary. According to the simulations, tidal salinity variations in the estuary are important factors that affect hyporheic-riparian salt transport processes and that the use of a time averaged estuarine salinity as an approximation to variable salinity conditions is unsuitable for the accurate prediction of the near-estuary dynamics in middle estuaries. This study was based on a two dimensional representation of the riparian scale interaction and it is clear that future research needs to focus on the three-dimensionality of the aquifer-estuary system, incorporating spatially and temporally varying flow and transport characteristics. That is, many estuaries are tortuous and the aquifer geology spatially complex such that assumptions required for the two-dimensional section will most likely restrict application to the field. The tidal dynamics in the middle estuary is also expected to generate three dimensional aspects to the aquifer-estuary interaction. Thus further investigation that explicitly models the hydrodynamics and salt transport in the estuary and estuarine morphology is required to refine the insight provided by the simple conceptual model adopted in this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estuarine salinity, riparian zones, groundwater, numerical experiments, seawater intrusion, seepage face, aquitards, asymmetry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development and Clinical Utility of a Cued Retrieval Procedure in Auditory Verbal Working Memory: The Role of Semantic, Phonological and Temporal Cues</field><field name="creator">Dale Fogarty</field><field name="description">The effective operation of auditory verbal working memory processes is essential to both understanding and communicating in everyday life. These processes are particularly vulnerable to disruption in a wide range of clinical conditions that affect brain functioning. Problems with working memory are frequently the primary reason why people with brain dysfunction are referred for neuropsychological assessment; consequently, verbal memory has been ranked as the second most frequently assessed cognitive ability. However, current psychometric approaches, predominantly serial recall, paired-associate- and list-learning tasks have been designed mainly to detect the presence (and severity) or absence of memory impairment rather than identifying intact or impaired processes. Performance is usually measured by scores of free recall and recognition, with testing procedures that are often lengthy and time-consuming for both patients and clinicians. When assessing working memory, the span tasks have been viewed as &#8220;a complete assessment of the function of phonological short-term memory&#8221; (Vallar &amp; Papagno, 2002). Digit span, in particular, has come to be regarded as the principal neuropsychological methodology for evaluating the capacity of auditory working memory (Andrewes, 2001), despite doubts about its lack of sensitivity (Lezak, Howieson, &amp; Loring, 2004) and potential to overestimate capacity (Andrewes, 2001). Theoretical advances regarding the underlying component processes of encoding and retrieval have only slowly been incorporated into clinical practice but have not been applied in any systematic or coherent manner. Concepts of working memory have been extended to include semantic, phonological and temporal aspects. One potentially useful approach examined the role of phonological and semantic codes and cues and their susceptibility and immunity to interference effects (Tehan &amp; Humphreys, 1995). Alternatively, another study investigated patients&#8217; ability to accurately retrieve visual information by keeping track of the current episode, differentiating it from previous similar episodes that had the potential to reduce effective performance because of interference effects or poor discrimination (Parkin, Leng, &amp; Hunkin, 1990). The aim of the research reported in this thesis was to develop a more compact cuedretrieval procedure to directly measure the phonological, semantic and temporal aspects of working memory and to examine its clinical usefulness by administering the task to brain injury rehabilitation patients. The conceptual section of the introductory chapter commences with a discussion on memory systems, particularly working memory, and is followed by an examination of some of the core processes involved in successful and unsuccessful remembering (forgetting). The applied section examines traditional and current approaches to memory assessment in clinical practice and their limitations in addressing the clinical needs of patients with memory impairments. Finally, an alternative approach that focuses on specific encoding and cueing processes rather than overall recall, is proposed. Empirical studies are reported in the following four chapters; Chapter 2 described the development and implementation of the initial studies with non-clinical participants, while Chapter 3 described the refinement of the procedure. Semantic and phonological coding and cueing effects were examined within a temporal context. The findings clearly demonstrated that semantic and phonological processes acted in quite distinct and consistent ways, irrespective of the degree of prior exposure to the word stimuli. Participants had more difficulty keeping track of the current episode when the codes and cues were phonological. Following refinements to the stimuli and procedure, replication of the previous results confirmed that cued-retrieval using semantic, phonological and temporal cues was a legitimate approach to memory assessment. Furthermore, differential effects were still found even after significantly shortening the procedure, thus adding support for its potential usefulness in clinical settings. The next two chapters examined the clinical application of this alternative approach in brain injury rehabilitation patients. The ability of non-clinical participants and brain injury rehabilitation patients to effectively use codes and cues to retrieve verbal information was compared. Quite distinct profiles indicated that the cued-retrieval procedure clearly differentiated clinical and non-clinical participants. Brain injury patients obviously performed more poorly on both semantic and phonological tasks but they also demonstrated a reduced ability to effectively use phonological codes and cues in retrieving information, as their performance declined across successive episodes due to increasing interference effects. Finally, the cued-retrieval procedure was administered to brain injury patients in the context of routine, post-injury, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to examine the comparative value of this process approach in relation to other currently used clinical tests of verbal and working memory. The results clearly indicated that cued-retrieval was more sensitive in detecting memory impairments than most of the other tests in current use and, due to its brevity, was able to provide this information relatively quickly. The closing chapter summarized and integrated the empirical findings of these research studies and highlighted the implications for future clinical practice and further research. The preliminary evidence clearly indicated that this brief and sensitive method of examining the underlying processes of verbal working memory has clinical and theoretical potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Working Memory</field><field name="subject">cued-retrieval</field><field name="subject">phonological</field><field name="subject">Semantic</field><field name="subject">test development</field><field name="subject">memory assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and environmental interplay during development: Variation at metamorphosis in a natural population of the tropical abalone, Haliotis asinina (Linnaeus)</field><field name="creator">Elizabeth Amy Williams</field><field name="description">Regulation of transcription is an important molecular mechanism through which organisms can respond to environmental change. Environmentally-related transcriptional variation can play a significant role in evolution, potentially acting as a mechanism for the formation of new adaptive phenotypes. Organisms are most sensitive to the influence of external environmental variation during development, yet very few studies have explored environmentally-related transcriptional variation in early life history stages. Marine invertebrate metamorphosis, where intimate larval-environment interactions trigger settlement onto the benthos and a drastic morphological shift from larval to adult form, exemplifies the influence of environment on development. Variation in both the timing of metamorphosis and the form of specific metamorphic inductive cues, even at an intraspecific level, suggests that larvae have molecular mechanisms for surviving settlement and metamorphosis in a range of environmental conditions. The extent of transcriptional variation at metamorphosis remains largely unknown due to limited information on both the natural inductive cues and the molecular mechanisms directing metamorphosis in marine invertebrates. Contributing to current understanding of the interplay between genes, environment and phenotype during development, I explored molecular and ecological aspects of metamorphosis in a marine invertebrate, the tropical abalone Haliotis asinina. First, I employed cDNA microarray methods to identify candidate genes and document widespread transcriptional changes occurring in Haliotis asinina larvae during larval development and metamorphosis. Microarray results reveal that as the abalone veliger larva matures, it requires coordinated regulation of temporally different gene batteries involved in a wide range of physiological and developmental processes associated with the transition to a new, benthic habitat. All candidate genes showed changes in expression following exposure of larvae to coralline algae, an external inductive cue, demonstrating the remarkable effect of environment on transcription during marine invertebrate metamorphosis. 144 genes, ~40% of which are novel, were identified as candidates for a role in H. asinina metamorphosis. This high proportion of novel genes indicates that the conserved signaling pathways operating in marine invertebrate metamorphosis likely regulate the expression of taxon-specific genes. The relationship between abalone larvae and their natural inductive cue, coralline algae, is species-specific. To characterize the metamorphic cue preferences of Haliotis asinina larvae from Heron Island Reef, Australia, I documented larval induction response to a number of different coralline algae species commonly found in adult H. asinina habitat. H. asinina larvae exhibit highly specific responses to induction of metamorphosis by different coralline algae species, with 0 &#8211; 100% metamorphosis by 48 hours post induction depending on algae species. Unlike any other abalone species studied, the most effective inducers of Heron Island Reef H. asinina are articulated corallines of the genus Amphiroa. Comparing the response of different larval families to select species of coralline algae indicated that coralline algae community composition is likely to significantly impact H. asinina population structure. Additionally, I compared larval response to dead and live coralline algae to show that induction specificity is driven by chemical, not physical, properties. Characterization of the surface cell biomarkers of three different coralline algae species indicates that algal biomolecular composition relates to variations in H. asinina induction response. To explore the influence of variation in larval induction environment, I compared transcription patterns of 17 metamorphosis-related genes in Haliotis asinina larvae induced by three different species of coralline algae. H. asinina post-induction gene expression profiles vary according to the species of coralline algae inducer. This transcriptional variation occurs in genes with diverse functions and spatial expression patterns, highlighting the global nature of the impact of benthic microhabitat on gene expression. The environment-specific modulation of gene expression in H. asinina post-induction may be a means for marine invertebrates to cope with changes in their settlement environment at metamorphosis. Genes expressed in the larval sensory structures acting to detect external metamorphic cues may be particularly good candidates for studying environmentally-related transcriptional variation. I identified three novel genes expressed in putative sensory structures of Haliotis asinina larvae just prior to metamorphosis. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes correlate with changes in larval ciliation patterns throughout metamorphosis, strongly suggestive of a role in metamorphic initiation. The three genes exhibit significant overlap in spatial expression profiles, indicative of genetic crosstalk between different sensory systems at metamorphosis. Transcriptional variation in gastropod sensory system genes may have assisted the evolution of different metamorphic inductive cues for different species. The results presented here establish an important role for transcriptional variation during marine invertebrate metamorphosis. Transcriptional variation underlies the morphological change from larval to adult body plan and also appears to assist larval recruitment in variable benthic habitats. Modulation of gene expression at metamorphosis in response to the environment may ultimately influence marine invertebrate species biogeography and evolution.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Abalone Haliotis-asinina</field><field name="subject">coralline algae</field><field name="subject">development</field><field name="subject">Ecological Genetics</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">Larval Settlement</field><field name="subject">marine ecology</field><field name="subject">Metamorphosis</field><field name="subject">life history evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene Therapy For Glioblastoma Multiforme: A Novel Treatment For A Fatal Disease</field><field name="creator">Teong Lip Chuah</field><field name="description">Gliomas are the commonest primary tumours of the brain and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents more than 50% of this group. GBM remains a neurosurgical conundrum since patients often succumb to the disease within one year. Surgery followed by radiation and medical regimens over the years have had minimal impact on the prognosis of patients with this cancer and hence, alternative and novel therapeutic modalities are required if the survival of patients with this disease is to be significantly improved. The ATM gene, which is mutated in the disease ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), is implicated in response to radiation-induced DNA damage, leading to profound radiosensitivity. By reducing the levels of ATM in the radioresistant GBM cells through antisense or RNA interference (RNAi) technology delivered by lentiviruses, malignant GBM tumour cells were successfully sensitised to radiation treatment. In conjunction with surgery, this strategy will provide an enhanced therapeutic intervention especially in the case of GBM where the tumour is untreatable.

The biography of Crawford Munro (1904-76) describes his early life in Toowoomba and Sydney, and his maturation as an engineer, working for Sydney Water, Sydney Technical College and in the production of Cruiser tanks in World War II. He was a large confident man with a big voice and an optimistic, humorous personality. As the Foundation Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of New South Wales Munro was liberal, fostered humanist studies and developed the School of Engineering with a unique emphasis on water engineering. He recruited excellent staff for research and postgraduate education who led the nation across all phases of hydrology and hydraulics. Munro developed a remarkable, rational solution for flood mitigation at Launceston, and actively promoted research, partly through the Australian Water Research Foundation and the Institution of Engineers, Australia. He was much involved with predicting flood runoff, developing benefit/cost relations for irrigation schemes, which led him into public controversy, and other hydrological projects. Munro&#8217;s attempts to raise social consciousness about water problems, his multi-disciplinary approach to the evaluation of water resources and his campaigns for the collection of stream and rainfall data helped provide a better basis for proper planning. In his later years he undertook the first Australian environmental impact study. The concluding chapter outlines a vision for the current management of Australia&#8217;s water. Munro posed necessary questions about measuring the supply of water and bringing the demand of water into synchrony with its supply, while providing water security in terms of its availability and quality. He raised the debate about the balance between sustaining environmental flows, utilizing water for agriculture and secondary industry, and maintaining the health of communities. Munro hoped equitable decision making would emerge from public engagement on these issues. 2. Twentieth century science biography in Australia is the province of a group of elite male scientists, whose interests cover wide disciplinary fields; it is focused on popular imagination: health, food and adventure (Antarctica) accounting for fifteen of the seventeen scientists. Empathy for the subject is a significant feature of the nineteen biographers, of whom five are scientists. This small genre is often supported by institutions in small print runs. A key role of biography is to place through science history a more epistemologically plausible version of events. Public discourses of science treated in the essay include conflict about the attribution of scientific discovery, the vocation of the scientist as a contributor to a wider social polity, the light biography sheds on sources of creativity and the evolution of the research and culture of institutions. The biographer attempts to generate a personal portrait of the scientist which conveys authority about the significance and origins of his or her scientific discoveries and their impact in the wider social context. Daniel S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s affirmation of the existential approach which &#8216;emphasizes the freedom and responsibility of the human individual&#8217; resonates with the candidate as expressing characteristics of the lives of many Australian scientists in their passion for intellectual discovery, their motivation to self-empowerment, and their readiness top step outside their social conditioning. This essay extends S&#246;derqvist&#8217;s paradigm to the context of Australian science biography and indicates some constraints on its depiction which arise in the practice of writing science biography. Some epistemological issues are raised in the texts, especially when dealing with oral history and family mythology, and thematic, thematic within a chronological framework or chronological structures of the text are compared. The level of detail and context influence the sustainability of the reader&#8217;s interest. Case studies of the biographies written by the candidate (Ian Clunies Ross, Samuel Wadham, Allan Callaghan, Victor Trikojus, Raymond Hoffenberg and Crawford Munro) illustrate issues which arise in the writing of science biography. The dominant question is the relationship of the biographer to the subject, and this determines the voice the reader hears. The motivation of the biographer may arise in varying degrees of empathy felt for the subject. The high affinity the candidate had for Clunies Ross and Hoffenberg causes him to offer a defence against the charge of hagiography, and the selectivity and subjectivity of the biographer is evident in the arrangement and presentation of factual material. The motivation of the biographer is additionally directed to the communication of the subject&#8217;s research outputs to the wider Australian community, and in the case of Callaghan, Wadham and Clunies Ross there was a specific programmatic function of advancing the status of agricultural science. It is argued that the description of the public life of the subject needs to be complemented from the private life if the biographer is &#8216;to view the world through the eyes of the subject&#8217;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">science biography, epistemology, history, science institutions, munro, water, hydrology, environmental sustainability, irrigation, planning</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SPATIAL VARIATION IN WATER AVAILABILITY, SOIL NUTRIENT AND WATER CONSTRAINTS FOR RAINFED LOWLAND RICE PRODUCTION IN SAVANNAKHET PROVINCE, SOUTHERN LAO PDR</field><field name="creator">Thavone Inthavong</field><field name="description">Drought and poor soil fertility are often cited as major constraints to rainfed lowland rice production in Laos, particularly in the central and southern parts of the country, where uncertainty in the growing season is common, due mainly to a combination of unreliable rainfall and coarse textured soils with a low water holding capacity and high rates of deep percolation. The soil conditions, together with fluctuations in rainfall distribution, are regarded as the most serious constraints to achieving high and stable grain yields in the rainfed lowland rice ecosystem in this region. Improvements in rainfed lowland rice productivity depend, in part, on improved predictions of water availability, as well as better understanding of soil nutrient and water stress limitations to grain yield. The use of a soil water balance model, in conjunction with the quantification of soil nutrient availability, can help in estimating free water levels in the rice fields, thereby helping determine the duration of the growing period, as well as, helping with predictions of potential yield reduction due to water stress and soil nutrient limitations. Linking the simulated results with Geographic Information System (GIS) can help quantify the spatial pattern of these attributes at a provincial or regional scale. This study was aimed at quantifying the spatial distribution of water availability, including the frequency and severity of water stress development during the growing period, and to estimate the effects of soil fertility and water stress on rice productivity in Savannakhet province in southern Lao PDR. The current status in relation to the variability in field water availability, soil fertility, farm crop management practices and grain yield throughout Savannakhet province were quantified, first by collecting farm data from 53 and 48 farmers&#8217; fields in the 2007 and 2008 cropping seasons, respectively, These farms were selected to be representative of a wide range of soil and climate conditions within the province. The results show that rainfall distribution pattern, soil type and toposequence position of paddy fields, are crucial factors contributing to the temporal variation in field water availability. The overall yield loss due to water stress associated with late season drought was estimated to be rather small (10%, 5% and 3% for the top, middle and bottom toposequence positions of rice fields, respectively) in the 2008 wet season. On the other hand, application of chemical fertilizer has a large effect on final grain yield, with 50 kg N ha-1 and 30 kg P2O5 ha-1 increasing yield by 600 to 800 kg and 800 to 1000kg ha-1 respectively, in the 2007 and 2008 cropping seasons. A new soil water balance (SWB) model that incorporates the effect of low soil clay content on deep percolation, was developed to quantify field water availability and the length of growing period (LGP) for various rainfall lowland rice cropping environments. The model estimates the amount of water stored in a soil profile, the profile being divided into two layers: Layer 1 (0-200 mm) consists of standing water and the topsoil layer, while Layer 2 (200-1000 mm) is the subsoil layer. The SWB model was validated with field experimental data obtained in the 2002 and 2008 cropping seasons. The simulated free water levels were close to those recorded for the observed field data, with a small mean average error, lower root mean square error, and significant correlation coefficient and index of agreement over all sites across the three toposequence positions of paddy fields. Maps of the length, start and end of growing period (LGP, SGP and EGP, respectively) for rainfed lowland rice in Savannakhet province, were developed using the SWB model, with inputs of median weekly climatic data and soil water characteristics. The province was delineated into three main LGP zones with a short LGP zone (less than 21 weeks) in the east, northwest and some rice fields in the south-western corner of the province; an intermediate LGP zone (21 to 24 weeks) was defined in the central and western part of the province; and a long LGP zone (greater than 24 weeks) for the south and for some rice fields in the western part of the province. The variation in the SGP from year-to-year was due largely to the variation in rainfall early in the wet-season (e.g. April), while EGP was strongly dependent upon the clay content of the soils being cropped. The SWB model was combined with other models that estimate yield potential, soil nutrient supply and yield reduction by low soil water level, to characterize and map the suitability zones for rainfed lowland rice in Savannakhet province. The overall results of the model performance on yield estimates were satisfactorily, with a significant correlation coefficient (0.54**) and high index of agreement (0.68) over the 2007 and 2008 seasons. The model classified three main rice agro-ecological zones according to the suitability of climate and soil conditions. The majority of the lowland rice growing areas are classified as moderately suitable to marginally suitable, while the potential area classified as being high suitable is very small. A large potential response of rice yields to fertilizer inputs is predicted for most of rice growing areas in the province. The best sowing time for achieving a high yield, as evaluated by the model, is the first half of June. Appropriate crop phenology and increasing fertilizer use efficiency that matches with water availability and soil conditions in each rice agro-ecological zone, are important in achieving improvements in rice productivity, as substantial improvements in rice fields cannot be achieved by improving water availability alone, where paddy fields are dominated by soils with low level of indigenous fertility. Although the model is capable of quantifying field water availability and crop yield due to the limitations associated with low levels of soil nutrients and water stress, the model has the potential for further improvements in two areas. First, the estimates of water loss need to be modified by incorporating variable factors such as slope of paddy field, which can affects lateral water movement and hence free water level. Second, the model should incorporate some key agronomic variables, such as internal efficiencies and recovery efficiencies of applied fertilizer, which depend on variety, crop management and climatic conditions, and these factors can be modelled.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial variation</field><field name="subject">Water availability</field><field name="subject">Soil nutrient</field><field name="subject">Water constraint</field><field name="subject">Rainfed lowland rice</field><field name="subject">Production</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Subsoil constraints to root growth and water use efficiency in northern grain soils: osmotic and toxic effects of salinity</field><field name="creator">Anna Sheldon</field><field name="description">Abstract Salinity has considerable adverse effects on agriculture through reduction in plant growth and water use. Sodium chloride salinity has both an osmotic effect on plant water relations, and a toxic effect on cellular processes. The relative contribution of these two effects to plant growth depends on a range of factors including plant specific tolerance mechanisms, such as Na and Cl exclusion, compartmentation of ions at a whole plant and cellular level, and synthesis of organic osmotic compounds for plant osmotic adjustment. Plants growing in saline soil would also experience reduced plant available water, due to the additional osmotic effect on soil water potential. The effect of salinity on plant growth is further complicated by the interactions of environmental conditions with plant water and ion uptake. This thesis examines the osmotic and toxic effects of salinity on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), with particular focus on plant water availability, effects of Na and Cl toxicity, and temperature and humidity effects. While considerable research has been undertaken into the physiological response of plants to NaCl, our understanding of the capacity of plants to extract water from saline soils has remained largely theoretical. Total plant available water is largely determined by the matric potential of the soil. Presence of sodium chloride would have an additional osmotic effect, and previous theory stated that the salt tolerance of the plant determined the extent to which this osmotic potential reduced plant available water. The capacity of wheat and chickpea to extract water from saline soils was examined in a soil experiment where water stress was imposed on established plants, which were then grown until permanent wilting point (PWP) was reached. Wheat extracted to lower soil water potentials (-1.5 MPa), than chickpea (-900 kPa) in 0 NaCl treatments. Where salinity was low to moderate, plants were able to extract water to a PWP determined by the combined total of matric and osmotic potentials. Wheat extracted water to PWP in salinity treatments up to soil ECse of 5.3 dS/m, and chickpea to 2.9 dS/m. As salinity increased, toxic effects of salinity dominated, and water extraction by plants was significantly lower than that determined by total soil water potential. Solution culture experiments investigated the comparative toxic effects of Na, Cl and salt mixtures. Growth of wheat was reduced by Na toxicity, but not Cl toxicity, with Na causing a small, but significant additional reduction in growth, compared to high Cl or a salt mixture. Reductions in growth of 50% from control treatments occurred at -500 kPa for the Na treatment, and -630 kPa for the Cl and mixed salt treatments. In contrast, growth of chickpea was significantly reduced by both Na and Cl toxicity, with a large difference in growth compared to the salt mixture. Growth reductions of 50% occurred at -330 kPa for the Cl treatments, and -450 kPa for the Na treatment. A 50% growth reduction was not observed in the mixed salt treatment. Tolerance of saline conditions is reduced under stressful environmental conditions, such as high temperature and low relative humidity. Hot and dry conditions were shown to reduce the tolerance of saline conditions by both wheat and chickpea, compared to cool or humid conditions. Tissue concentrations of Na in wheat were disproportionately high in treatments with high evaporative demand, while tissue Cl was not related to evaporative demand. Tissue concentrations of Na in chickpea increased with temperature, but not relative humidity, while tissue Cl concentrations were highly correlated with evaporative demand. The relationships between NaCl salinity, plant water use, and environmental conditions were examined, allowing further development of the two phase salinity model. In particular, the transition point between the osmotic and toxic salinity effects. While the concentration of NaCl in the soil remains the primary factor, soil water status, environmental stresses and presence of other salts may dictate whether salinity be tolerated by the plant or not. The ability of the plant to extract water to PWP, as determined by total matric and osmotic potential has been identified as a useful indicator of salinity tolerance. The point at which toxicity of Na and/or Cl is observed is associated with a rapid increase in Na and Cl uptake by the shoot tissue, and a decrease in the amount of water the plant is able to extract from the soil. Within the osmotic region of salinity stress, the plant is able to extract water to PWP, but as NaCl becomes toxic the plant is unable to utilize this water.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat</field><field name="subject">Chickpea</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Sodium</field><field name="subject">Chloride</field><field name="subject">Toxicity</field><field name="subject">plant available water</field><field name="subject">Osmotic Stress</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE USE OF COACHING BEHAVIOUR SCALE - SPORT IN EVALUATING AND DEVELOPING THE WORK OF HIGH PERFORMANCE BASKETBALL COACHES IN SINGAPORE</field><field name="creator">Koon Teck Koh</field><field name="description">Coaching is highly complex and dynamic, especially at the high performance level when the work demands and expectations are significant (Lyle, 2002). High performance coaches have to systematically plan, monitor and evaluate their programmes. At the same time, they have to manage a complex performance environment, including support systems (e.g., sports sciences, logistics and officials), to ensure that their athletes perform and achieve successful results (Knowles, Tyler, Gilbourne, &amp; Eubank, 2006; Lyle, 2002; Potrac, Brewer, Jones, Armour, &amp; Holf, 2000). Accordingly, I have substantiated throughout this thesis that there is a need to: (1) understand how the Singapore high performance basketball coaches develop to their current position, (2) examine what the perceived important work tasks of these coaches are as perceived by the team managers, players, coaches and experts in basketball, (3) develop a context-specific tool to evaluate basketball coaches&#8217; work, and (4) engage coaches in reflection and to guide them through the reflection process, with the aim of enhancing their coaching practices, and subsequently improving players&#8217; performance and satisfaction level in the Under-18 national team. Research showed that there is a strong correlation between the experiences/background of coaches and the way they coach (e.g., Erickson, C&#244;t&#233;, &amp; Fraser-Thomas, 2007). Study 1 identified the coaching pathways of high performance basketball coaches in Singapore to enhance understanding of how these experiences may have influenced and shaped their coaching behaviour. The result supports the benefits of diversified sports participation during early childhood. Qualitative data also shows that all coaches involved in this study perceived benefit from diversified sports participation during early childhood. Such exposure to a variety of physical activities was considered beneficial for later sports specialization during adolescence as some of the concepts and skills were transferrable (e.g., Erickson et al., 2007). A point that is consistently emphasized throughout this thesis is that coaching is context-specific. The work tasks performed by the high performance basketball coaches in Singapore may not be congruent with coaches in other countries and sports. Therefore, it is my view that there is a need to examine the important work tasks of high performance basketball coaches in Singapore, and consequently, to develop a sport and context-specific instrument to capture and evaluate their work appropriately. Study 2 sought to examine the key tasks of high performance basketball coaches in Singapore using the Coach Behaviour Scale for Sports (CBS-S; C&#244;t&#233;, Yardley, Hay, Sedgwick, &amp; Baker, 1999). The CBS-S (C&#244;t&#233; et al., 1999) was developed from research conducted on high performance gymnastic coaches and athletes. It was subsequently used in a few countries in different sports to measure the perception of athletes and their satisfaction level with regard to the coaching they have received. Seventeen participants (national coaches, team managers, players and other experts) took part in the study in which quantitative (CBS-S) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews) data were collected. The quantitative data were analysed using SPSS (Version 15.0) and the qualitative data were content analysed by three experienced researchers in sport psychology and coaching. The findings revealed that the dimensions and items from the CBS-S were considered mostly relevant in evaluating the work of Singapore&#8217;s high performance basketball coaches. Nevertheless, some modifications were made to the CBS-S to make it more specific to the basketball context in Singapore based on conceptual, theoretical and empirical considerations. The final version of the Singapore CBS-S (Basketball) has 10 dimensions with 104 items as opposed to the original CBS-S with 8 dimensions and 77 items. Overall, the findings from this study were consistent with the literature on coaches&#8217; work. There are benefits for engaging in the reflection process. As stated in Chapter 3, reflective practice has gained popularity in many contexts such as art (e.g., Roberts, 2001), education (e.g., Smyth, 1991) and sports (Gilbert &amp; Trudel, 2001; Kidman, 2001) just to name a few. Reflection, if done properly, has the potential to enhance performance. The aim of Study 3 is to use the data collected from the Singapore CBS-S (Basketball) to guide coaches in their reflection, with the aim of enhancing the quality of their coaching practices. Feedback was given to these coaches at the end of pre-season and during training sessions. Qualitative data showed that both coaches in this study were involved in different forms (e.g., Gilbert &amp; Trudel, 2004; Knowles, Gilbourne, Borrie, &amp; Neville, 2001; Sch&#246;n, 1983, 1987) and levels of reflection (Van Manen, 1977) as suggested in the literature. There was sufficient evidence to suggest that both coaches had made adjustments to their coaching behaviours and methods after the pre-season feedback session. Nevertheless, post-season results from the men&#8217;s team players revealed that their coach has made significant improvement in his coaching; whilst players from the women&#8217;s team felt otherwise. The difference in results may be closely linked to the coaching philosophy, athletic and coaching background of the two coaches who were involved in this study. These factors may have shaped the way they reflected and addressed the coaching issues. Post-season qualitative data showed that coaches and players affirmed the benefits of the feedback process, using the Singapore CBS-S (Basketball) as an objective tool to gather data. Such findings will have significant impact on the future of Basketball coaching in Singapore at the high performance level.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coaching behaviour, CBS-S, evaluation of coaches&#8217; work, reflective practice</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rejected! The harmful effects of workgroup mistreatment and the moderating role of organizational norms</field><field name="creator">Nikki Penhaligon</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the harmful effects of mistreatment by the workgroup, and the role of perceived rejection as a critical mediator linking mistreatment and outcomes. This research program had three primary purposes. First, the research aimed to examine the important role of workgroup mistreatment as an independent predictor of negative outcomes, over and above the influence of supervisor mistreatment. Second, the research aimed to examine the effect of perceived rejection as an explanatory variable linking workgroup mistreatment and outcomes. Finally, the moderating effect of organizational norms on the relationship between workgroup mistreatment and perceived rejection was examined. The relationships of interest were examined over four studies, using multiple methods of data collection, across part-time and full-time working samples. In Study 1 (Chapter 2), the independent role of workgroup mistreatment and the mediating role of perceived rejection were examined. One hundred and forty two part-time working participants took part in the study. The participants completed a questionnaire on workplace behaviors in their organizations. The results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed a strong harmful effect of workgroup mistreatment, independent of mistreatment by the supervisor. In addition, the results showed that perceived rejection fully mediated the relationship between workgroup mistreatment and depression and organizational based self esteem. The study highlighted that perceived rejection acts as a key underlying psychological mechanism involved in the effect of workgroup mistreatment. This study has been published in the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. Study 2 and Study 3 were presented as one paper in Chapter 3. The aims of these two studies was to explore the effects of workgroup mistreatment on a wider range of individual and organizational level outcomes, and to provide further evidence of the mediating role of perceived rejection as observed in Study 1. The results from both studies demonstrated that workgroup mistreatment had a significant and independent role in predicting negative individual and organizational level outcomes, providing support for the findings of Study 1. In the first study, 189 participants received scenarios manipulating workgroup mistreatment and supervisor mistreatment. The results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed that workgroup mistreatment harmfully affected participants, over and above that of the supervisor. The results also demonstrated that perceived rejection mediated the positive relationships between workgroup mistreatment and depression and organizational deviance, and also the negative relationships between workgroup mistreatment and organizational based self esteem and organizational citizenship behaviors. The second study included an additional aim, to examine the moderating role of supportive organizational norms. Two hundred and twenty nine participants read scenarios that manipulated workgroup mistreatment, supervisor mistreatment and organizational norms. The results of hierarchical regression analyses revealed the significant harmful effects of workgroup mistreatment, over and above the influence of supervisor mistreatment. The results also revealed the mediating role of perceived rejection. The direct effect of positive organizational norms also emerged, consistent with previous research. In addition, the result revealed that employees who experienced supportive organizational norms were more likely to reconcile with their workgroup members after experiencing mistreatment compared to employees who experienced hostile organizational norms. Finally, an unexpected pattern on the key affective variables of depression and organizational based self esteem emerged, such that mistreatment led to more negative outcomes in the supportive norms condition than in the hostile condition, where employees appeared to be desensitized. This paper is currently under review at the Journal of Applied Social Psychology. In Study 4 (Chapter 4), the overall model of workplace mistreatment was tested on a sample of full-time workers in an applied setting. One hundred and seventy two adults took part in the study. Participants were required to evaluate their workplace regarding mistreatment and organizational norms and to report their own psychological, behavioral and organizational outcomes. The results revealed that workgroup mistreatment was associated with increased depression, stress and avoidance, over and above supervisor mistreatment. In addition, the results revealed that perceived rejection acted as an explanatory variable linking workgroup mistreatment to a number of outcomes. Furthermore, the moderating role of hostile organizational norms emerged on depression, stress, reconciliation and avoidance. This paper is currently under review at the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. Overall, the four studies provided empirical support for the majority of the hypotheses. The effects were demonstrated for a range of psychological, behavioral, and organizational level outcomes, using multiple methods of data collection, across part-time and full-time workers. At the conclusion of the thesis (Chapter 5), an overall summary is provided of the findings across all four studies, practical and theoretical implications and research directions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Workgroup mistreatment, perceived rejection, organizational norms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elucidating the Metabolic Function of RORalpha and gamma in Skeletal Muscle</field><field name="creator">Surya Prakash</field><field name="description">Nuclear Hormone Receptors (NRs) are hormone dependent DNA binding proteins that translate physiological signals into gene expression. Gene products have been identified that belong to the NR superfamily on the basis of homology. However, the endogenous and /or synthetic ligands that regulate their activity remain unknown, consequently, this subgroup of proteins are designated as orphans). Retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptors alpha and gamma(ROR&#945; and &#947;) are orphan NRs, and are preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle a major metabolic tissue and other tissues including pancreas, thymus, prostate, liver, adipose and testis. Surprisingly, the specific roles of ROR &#945; and &#947; in skeletal muscle, a peripheral tissue, have not been examined. Muscle is one of the most energy demanding tissues which accounts for ~40% of the total body mass and energy expenditure, ~75% of glucose disposal and relies heavily on &#946;-oxidation of fatty acids. We hypothesize that ROR &#945; and &#947; regulates metabolism in this major mass lean tissue. Initially, this hypothesis was examined by &#8220;gain and loss&#8221; of function studies in an in-vitro mouse skeletal muscle cell culture model. Previous in vitro studies analyzed the role of ROR&#945; in the regulation of lipid homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. We similarly conducted in vitro ROR&#947; gain and loss of function studies in skeletal muscle cells to understand the role of this isoform in metabolism. We utilized stable ectopic over-expression of VP16-ROR&#947; (gain of function), native ROR&#947; and ROR&#947;&#916;H12 (loss of function) vectors to modulate ROR&#947; mRNA expression and function. Candidate driven expression profiling of lines that ectopically express the native and variant forms of ROR&#947; suggested that this orphan NR has a function in regulating the expression of genes that control lipid homeostasis (fatty acid-binding protein 4), CD36 (fatty acid translocase), lipoprotein lipase and uncoupling protein 3), carbohydrate metabolism (GLUT5 (fructose transporter), adiponectin receptor 2 and interleukin 15 (IL-15)) and muscle mass (including myostatin and IL-15). Interestingly, our study revealed a function for ROR&#947; in the pathway that regulates production of reactive oxygen species which was also correlated with increased expression of UCP3 mRNA. Subsequently, we conducted in vivo studies with mouse models displaying global and muscle specific perturbation in ROR&#945; expression and function to elucidate the physiological role of this orphan NR in the context of metabolism.Along these lines, we characterized homozygous staggerer mice (sg/sg) in the context of lipid, carbohydrate and energy homeostasis. Staggerer mice were characterized by decreased and dysfunctional retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (ROR&#945;) expression. We observed decreases in serum (and liver) triglycerides and total and high density lipoprotein serum cholesterol in staggerer mice. Moreover, the staggerer mice were associated with reduced adiposity, decreased fat pad mass and adipocyte size. Candidate-based expression profiling demonstrated that the dyslipidemia in staggerer mice was associated with decreased hepatic expression of SREBP-1c, and the reverse cholesterol transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1. This was consistent with the reduced serum lipids. Furthermore, the lean phenotype in staggerer mice was also characterized by significantly increased expression of PGC-1&#945;, PGC-1&#946;, and lipin1mRNAin liver and white and brown adipose tissue from staggerer mice. In addition, we observed a significant 4-fold increase in &#946;2-adrenergic receptor mRNA in brown adipose tissue. Finally, dysfunctional ROR&#945; expression protects against diet-induced obesity. Following a 10-week high fat diet, wild-type (but not sg/sg) mice exhibited a ~20% weight gain, increased hepatic triglycerides, and notable white and brown adipose tissue accumulation. In summary, these changes in gene expression (that modulate lipid homeostasis) in metabolic tissues were involved in decreased adiposity and resistance to diet induced obesity in the sg/sg mice, despite hyperphagia. Finally, we specifically modulated ROR&#945; signaling in skeletal muscle by the targeted over-expression of truncated ROR&#945;&#916;DE (lacking the ligand binding domain) driven by a myogenic specific promoter, to investigate the contribution of this peripheral tissue to the ROR&#945; phenotype. Interestingly, transgenic heterozygous animals exhibit increased fasting blood glucose levels and mild glucose intolerance. Expression profiling (and western analysis) identified perturbations in the insulin signaling cascade. For example, we observed attenuation of p85alpha (PI3K) and Akt2 (mRNA and protein) expression; and insulin dependent induction of phospho-Akt2. In concordance, significantly increased levels of active phospho-AMPK were detected in the muscle of transgenic mice (relative to wt littermates). The increase in phospho-AMPK correlated with: (i) the suppression of lipogenic gene expression; and (ii) increased phospho-ACC and activation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal muscle of transgenic animals. In conclusion, we suggest these orphan nuclear receptors (ROR&#945; and &#947;) are key modulators of fat and carbohydrate homeostasis in skeletal muscle tissue. Specifically, we propose that, ROR&#945; plays vital role in fat accumulation in adipose tissue and insulin mediated glucose homeostasis in skeletal muscle. Therefore we suggest that selective muscle specific ROR&#945; modulators may have utility in the treatment of type2 diabetes and obesity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nuclear receptor, gene expression, lipid homeostasis, carbohydrate homeostasis, energy homeostasis,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) Nanoparticle-Based Nucleic Acid Delivery System</field><field name="creator">Yunyi Wong</field><field name="description">There has been much interest in the use of therapeutics based on ribonucleic acid interference(RNAi) to inhibit synthesis of mutant proteins ever since Elbashir et al. (Elbashir, S. M., Harborth, J., Lendeckel, W., Yalcin, A., Weber, K. and Tuschl, T., 2001. Duplexes of 21-nucleotide RNAs mediate RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells. Nature. 411, 494-498.) found that synthetic double stranded small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) can initiate this evolutionarily conserved process in mammalian cells. Since RNAi is able to target single genes and therefore mitigate the underlying molecular pathology of diseases, RNAi-based therapeutics will most likely benefit monogenic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington&#8217;s disease. It is however particularly difficult to deliver exogenous materials such as siRNAs into neurons in vivo as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) isolates the brain from the vascular system and prevents permeation of most materials. Neurons also do not take up exogenous materials readily. Therefore, effective delivery of siRNAs into the brain remains one of the biggest challenges impeding their use as a potential neurotherapeutic. Layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles are a class of anionic clay materials that have demonstrated great potential as a DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) delivery system for a variety of mammalian cell lines due to their unique physiochemical properties. This thesis examined the feasibility of LDH as a siRNA delivery system for cultured neurons and demonstrated that the delivered siRNAs are able to effectively down-regulate synthesis of a target protein with minimal toxicity. Experiments were conducted using double stranded DNAs (dsDNAs) initially, and siRNAs were then used to verify these results. It was shown that nucleic acids(dsDNAs and siRNAs) could successfully intercalate into pristine LDHs to form nucleic acid-LDH complexes that had properties suitable for use as a delivery system in mammalian cells. These studies established that LDHs and nucleic acid-LDH complexes were biocompatible with neurons isolated from embryonic day 17.5 mouse cerebral cortex, suggesting that LDH can be used for nucleic acid delivery into cultured neurons. LDHs were also shown to successfully deliver nucleic acids into a non-neural mammalian cell line (NIH 3T3 cells). Finally, this thesis demonstrated for the first time that LDHs were able to deliver siRNAs into neurons, providing encouraging preliminary evidence that sequence specific gene silencing of the Mus Musculus Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) gene had occurred. However, down-regulation of the DCC protein did not occur consistently, suggesting that further optimisation is needed to improve the efficacy of siRNA-LDH complexes to inhibit expression of target protein in neurons. In future, LDHs should be further developed as an efficient siRNA delivery system for therapeutic gene silencing in the central nervous system using a neurodegenerative disease model such as the Huntington&#8217;s disease mouse model, which closely phenocopies the human disease. This model will allow the in vivo efficacy of these nanoparticles to be tested and subsequently improved in order to deliver siRNAs locally and systematically into the brain.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH)</field><field name="subject">Nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">Cellular uptake</field><field name="subject">Neurons</field><field name="subject">Neurodegenerative disease</field><field name="subject">Nonviral delivery system</field><field name="subject">RNAi</field><field name="subject">dsDNA-LDH</field><field name="subject">siRNA-LDH</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRCA1, Kap1 and the DNA Damage Response</field><field name="creator">Kienan Savage</field><field name="description">Cancer cells exhibit genomic instability and are commonly defective in DNA damage signalling and/or DNA repair. There are many types of DNA damage inducing agents such as mechanical stress on chromosomes during recombination, chemotherapeutics, ionising and ultraviolet radiation and endogenously produced free radicals. These genetic lesions pose a serious threat to the cell and evoke a rapid and intricate DNA damage response signalling pathway involving many transducer and effector pathways including cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, chromatin remodelling, and apoptotic pathways. Genetic mutations within genes in this pathway often lead to genomic instability and cancer. The main effectors of the DNA damage response are the protein kinases ATM and ATR which are rapidly activated in response to DNA damage induction and phosphorylate a large and diverse number of targets including the checkpoint kinases Chk1, and Chk2, the tumour suppressors p53 and BRCA1 and chromatin associated proteins such as H2AX. BRCA1 is a key transducer molecule within the DNA damage response. This is evident from its loss, which leads to defects in many damage response processes such as cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. BRCA1s binding partner BARD1 has also been implicated in the DNA damage response and recent reports indicate that these proteins co-operate in this pathway. This study utilises a multifaceted approach to further characterise the function of the BRCA1/BARD1 complex within the DNA damage response. Firstly we have used shRNA to deplete the BRCA1/BARD1 complex and have shown that the BRCA1/BARD1 complex is required for ATM/ATR dependent phosphorylation of p53Ser-15 in response to IR and UV induced DNA damage. In contrast, we have shown that the phosphorylation of a number of other ATM/ATR dependent targets including H2AX, Chk2, and c-jun do not require the BRCA1/BARD1 complex. The study has also revealed that the prior phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 is required for the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-15. Furthermore, we have shown that these phosphorylation events are required for IR induced G1/S cell cycle arrest via transcriptional induction of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The second part of this study involved the characterisation of a putative BRCA1 interacting protein &#8211; The KRAB associated protein 1 (Kap1). During this study we have been unable to confirm Kap1 as a bona fide BRCA1 interactor, however we have identified a clear role for Kap1 in the DNA damage response pathway. Using Mass spectrometric phospho amino acid mapping we have identified a novel Chk2 dependent phosphorylation site, Ser-473, within Kap1. Furthermore, we have shown that this phosphorylation event may regulate Histone H3-Lys-9 acetylation after DNA damage possibly regulating chromatin relaxation. This study has also identified a number of novel Kap1 interacting proteins, which appear to be regulated by Kap1 phosphorylation at Ser-473. These interactors may play an important role in the regulation of chromatin modification and/or structure after DNA damage. By studying the role of BRCA1 in the DNA damage response pathway we have not only uncovered a novel scaffolding function for BRCA1 in the G1/S checkpoint but have also identified a novel protein, Kap1, acting within the DNA damage response pathway. This study has identified a role for Kap-1 in the regulation of chromatin structure in response to DNA damage via the ATM &#8211; Chk2 pathway.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">BRCA1, BARD1, Kap1, ATM, ATR, Chk1, Chk2, DNA Damage.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194157</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Requirements on Nonlinear Optical Quantum Gates</field><field name="creator">Mingyin Patrick Leung</field><field name="description">Quantum information science has shown that computers which exploit the quantum nature of particles, namely quantum computers, can outperform contemporary computers in some computational tasks. The fundamental building blocks of a quantum computer are quantum logical gates and quantum bits (qubits). Previous research has shown that the optical approach to quantum computing is promising. However, linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) schemes require a huge amount of resource, which makes large scale LOQC impractical, and hence there have been renewed interests in nonlinear optical quantum computing schemes, where less resource is required. The performance of these quantum gates depends on the properties of the nonlinear media. However, requirements on some of the properties for high performance quantum gates are not fully known. This thesis intends to bridge this gap of knowledge and examines the necessary conditions on several types optical nonlinearities that are common in two-qubit quantum gates schemes. These types of nonlinearities are, namely two-photon absorption, $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity and $\chi^{(3)}$ cross-Kerr nonlinearity. The two-photon absorption based quantum Zeno gate is modeled in this thesis. It is shown that for practical absorbers, the photon loss significantly lowers the quantum fidelity of the Zeno gate. Nevertheless, this thesis proposes to use the Zeno gate for fusing optical cluster states. With the best theoretical estimate of single photon loss in the absorbers, the Zeno gate can outperform linear optical schemes. This thesis also proposes to embed the Zeno gate in the teleportation-type of two-qubit gate, namely GC-Zeno gate, such that the success rate of the gate can be traded off for higher gate fidelity. The effect of some mode matching error and detector inefficiency on the GC-Zeno gate are also considered here. It is shown that the photon loss requirement as well as the mode matching requirement are both stringent for having a fault tolerant GC-Zeno gate. This thesis models some of the properties of a $\chi^{(3)}$ optical medium and explores how they affect the fidelity of the cross-Kerr nonlinearity based quantum gate. This thesis shows that for a cross-Kerr medium with fast time response but negligible wave dispersion, the medium would induce spectral entanglement between the input photons and this significantly lowers the fidelity of the quantum gate. Nevertheless, when the dispersion has a stronger effect than the time response, and if phase noise is negligible, it is possible to achieve a quantum gate with high fidelity. However, the noise is actually significant, and this thesis suggests that spectral filtering can be applied to prohibit the occurrence of the noise. The requirements on employing optical $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity for quantum computing are also examined. This study models the spectral effects of a $\chi^{(2)}$ medium on its efficiency. It is shown in this thesis that since the Hamiltonian of the medium does not commute at different times, the unitary operation should be modeled by a Dyson series, which leads to undesired spectral entanglement that lowers the efficiency of the medium. However, in the case of periodical poling, the unitary operation can be modeled by a Taylor series, where under some phase matching conditions, the medium can have a high efficiency. Furthermore, this thesis proposes a Bell measurement scheme and a quantum gate scheme based on $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity that can always outperform linear optics even when the nonlinearity strength is weak. In the case of sufficiently strong nonlinearity, a quantum gate with high success rate can be achieved. In summary, this thesis models some of the properties of two-photon absorbers, $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearity, and shows that it is possible to achieve the conditions required for high performance quantum gates, however these conditions are experimentally challenging to meet.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">quantum computing</field><field name="subject">optical nonlinearity</field><field name="subject">two-photon absorption</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tree growth and mortality and implications for restoration and carbon sequestration in Australian subtropical semi-arid forests and woodlands</field><field name="creator">John Dwyer</field><field name="description">Many researchers have highlighted the dire prospects for biodiversity in fragmented agricultural landscapes and stressed the need for increasing the area of, and connectivity between, natural ecosystems. Some have advocated the use of naturally regenerating forest ecosystems for sequestering atmospheric carbon, with opportunities for dual restoration and carbon benefits. However, no studies have explicitly explored the feasibility of obtaining such dual benefits from a regenerating woody ecosystem. This thesis aims to provide a detailed assessment of the restoration and carbon potential of Brigalow regrowth, an extensive naturally regenerating ecosystem throughout the pastoral regions of north eastern Australia. It combines observational, experimental and modelling techniques to describe the agricultural legacy of pastoral development, identify constraints to restoration and explore methods to remove these constraints. A review of existing ecological knowledge of Brigalow ecosystems is provided in chapter 3, along with discussion of policy and socio-economic issues that are likely to influence how and to what extent regrowth is utilised for restoration and carbon purposes in the Brigalow Belt. The review found restoring regrowth is likely to have benefits for a wide range of native flora and fauna, including the endangered bridled nailtail wallaby. Knowledge gaps exist relating to the landscape ecology of Brigalow regrowth and the impacts of management and climate change on carbon and restoration potential. Also, a conflict exists between short-term carbon sequestration and long-term restoration goals. Regional demand for high biomass regrowth as a carbon offset is likely to be high but ambiguities in carbon policy threaten to diminish the use of natural regrowth for reforestation projects. A large cross-sectional study of regrowth is presented in chapter 4. Data were analysed using multi-level / hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs). Firstly, we found that repeated attempts at clearing Brigalow regrowth increases stem densities and densities remain high over the long term, particularly in high rainfall areas and on clay soils with deep gilgais. Secondly, higher density stands have slower biomass accumulation and structural development in the long term. Spatial extrapolations of the HBMs indicated that the central and eastern parts of the study region are most environmentally suitability for biomass accumulation, however these may not correspond to the areas that historically supported the highest biomass Brigalow forests. We conclude that carbon and restoration goals are largely congruent within regions of similar climate. At the regional scale however, spatial prioritisation of restoration and carbon projects may only be aligned in areas with higher carbon potential. Given the importance of stem density in determining restoration and carbon potential, an experimental thinning trial was established in dense Brigalow regrowth in southern Queensland (chapter 5). Four treatments were applied in a randomised block design and growth and mortality of a subset of stems was monitored for two years. Data were analysed using mixed-effects models and HBMs and the latter were subsequently used to parameterise an individual-based simulation model of stand structural development and biomass accumulation over 50 years. The main findings of this study were that growth and mortality of stems is influenced by the amount of space available to each stem (a neighbourhood effect) and that thinning accelerates structural development and increases woody species diversity. The examination of neighbourhood effects is taken further by considering drought-related mortality in a Eucalyptus savanna ecosystem (chapter 6). For this work a multi-faceted approach was employed including spatial pattern analyses and statistical models of stem survival to test three competing hypotheses relating to neighbourhood effects on drought related tree mortality. The main finding of this study was that neighbour density and microsite effects both influence drought-related mortality and the observed patterns can readily be explained by an interaction between these two factors. As a whole, this thesis contributes the following scientific insights: (1) restoration and carbon goals may be aligned for naturally regenerating woody ecosystems, but the degree of goal congruence will vary across the landscape in question, (2) while some woody ecosystems retain an excellent capacity to regenerate naturally, the agricultural legacy may still have long term effects on restoration and carbon potential, (3) neighbourhood effects that operate at the stem scale strongly influence dynamics at the ecosystem scale.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Brigalow, Acacia harpophylla, Silver-leaved Ironbark, Eucalyptus melanophloia, regrowth, restoration, carbon sequestration, agricultural legacy, biotic and abiotic legacy, multi-level models, hierarchical Bayesian models, intraspecific competition, neighb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Neuroinvasion and Neuropathology of West Nile virus</field><field name="creator">Rebecca Biron</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) has emerged as a major cause of viral encephalitis. Since its outbreak in the United States 27,000 people have presented with clinical WNV disease resulting in 1074 fatalities. WNV causes a range of disease from mild febrile illnesses to severe and fatal encephalitis. To date, there are currently no therapeutic agents or vaccines available to treat WNV infection in humans. In order to address this, a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for viral neuroinvasion and neuropathology are required. Using a range of in vitro and in vivo studies, we have investigated the routes by which WNV enters the CNS. Virus replication was observed in the brain microvascular endothelial cells in mice that succumbed to WNV encephalitis. Moreover, we demonstrated that infection of a polarized HBMEC with WNV induced apoptosis. Microarray analysis of WNV-infected HBMEC&#8217;s revealed that WNV elicited the expression of cytokines that have been shown to contribute to permeablization of the BBB. These findings suggest that WNV can enter the CNS through the BBB via multiple mechanisms. Real-time RT-PCR performed on WNVinfected HBMECs identified two host genes involved in the host cellular anti-oxidant response that were differentially regulated during viral infection. Furthermore, the addition of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, restored cell viability and decreased viral replication, indicating that oxidative stress contributes to WNV-induced pathogenesis. The current state of knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of WNV encephalitis is based on studies that have defined the role of systemic immune responses to WNV. Limited investigations have been undertaken to determine the contribution of brain cells in the defence, or damage to the brain once WNV has gained access to the CNS. Real-time RT-PCR results in conjunction with in vivo CBA assay data, suggested several candidate host genes that could contribute to the pathogenesis of WNV. Thus, it is necessary to further define the mechanisms of WNV induced pathogenesis as this will aid in the development of targeted strategies to prevent neurological infection and mitigate neurological diseases in affected individuals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">neuroinvasion</field><field name="subject">neuropathology</field><field name="subject">blood-brain-barrier</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Change in the Cultural Identity of German Settlers of the Logan and Maroochy Rivers, Queensland, 1860-1914</field><field name="creator">Jasmine Sommer</field><field name="description">This thesis concentrates on the 1860s migration and settlement experience of the first German settlers of Gramzow on Queensland&#8217;s Logan River. It also describes the internal migration of some among them to the North Arm of the Maroochy River in the early 1880s. The latter journey was undertaken in the company of other Germans from the Logan River district and formed part of a pattern of cluster and chain migration to the North Coast. The first chapter in this thesis discusses the early German settlers&#8217; decision to migrate from their homelands, and their economic and societal reasons for migration. The role played by Johann Christian Heussler in the Germans&#8217; choice of Queensland as a destination, and his contributions to the economic development of Queensland through his position as Emigration Agent to the German States, are reviewed. This thesis also attempts to bring balance to the reputation of Godeffroy and Son, the Hamburg shipping line engaged by Heussler, which brought most of the German settlers to Queensland in the 1860s. The company&#8217;s visible commercial strengths such as their size and experience in the Pacific, and their private, internal weaknesses such as failure to adopt new technologies, are examined. Conditions on the Godeffroy vessels are compared with the conditions on ships sailing from Hamburg to America. This approach avoids the usual comparison of German with British sailing ships coming into Moreton Bay. Britain&#8217;s exemplary standards for passenger health were beyond the reach of emigrant fleets who operated under Hamburg&#8217;s older regulations. The research concludes that, in the early 1860s, conditions on the Godeffroy ships for Queensland were superior to Hamburg ships for New York. Furthermore, this thesis describes the 1868 German settlement of Gramzow on the Logan River and compares it to Bethania. The significance of Queensland&#8217;s 1868 lands legislation to the German settlers is explored. It is suggested that the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act is connected to the U.S. Homestead Act, 1862, and a comparison is drawn between the Australian, American and Canadian lands settlement legislation. This comparison enables the further suggestion that homestead selectors of the Logan were part of an international group of homesteaders whose occupational identity was tied to opening the land to agricultural smallholding at little cost through many similar or identical legislative rules that predominantly impacted their economic standing positively. How land orders enabled Logan settlers to increase their land holdings is discussed, as are the negative aspects of the lands legislation such as the upper 160 acre limit on land holding. The migration of early German settlers of the Logan district north to Maroochy occurred under Queensland&#8217;s 1876 lands legislation. This thesis examines the settlement of Germans on the Canando Run along the North Arm of the Maroochy River in the early 1880s, and describes their settlement conditions. Their motives for moving are examined, how the discovery of gold at Gympie affected them is explored, and the establishment of three German businesses at Maroochy is described. A chart comparing the settlers&#8217; land holdings on the Logan with those at Maroochy illustrates that by moving north, some settlers were able to increase their land holdings threefold. The disappearance of Deutschtum (&#8216;German culture&#8217;) after the turn of the century is examined in the final chapter. This thesis asks whether it is appropriate to continue to use the term &#8216;assimilation&#8217; when speaking of Queensland&#8217;s German settler community before and during the First World War. The term appears to draw a veil over the political and economic subjugation of the community during this period. The thesis proposes that it was easier to survive the difficulties of war in rural rather than in urban communities. Although the historiography of the German settlers of Queensland supports an academic conversation on topics such as German emigration, land acquisition and settlement, this thesis focuses on issues outside the boundaries of the current academic thrust. These issues include the settlement of Gramzow in 1868, the homestead provisions in the 1868 Crown Lands Alienation Act and their origins in lands legislation in America, the services provided through Johann Christian Heussler by the German emigrant shipping line &#8216;Godeffroy and Son,&#8217; the settlement of the North Arm of the Maroochy River by Logan Germans in the early 1880s, and a rejection of the term &#8216;assimilation&#8217; to describe the eradication of German culture in Queensland after 1914. The leitmotif of this thesis is cultural identity and it explores change in German settlers through various aspects of their identity such as their psychological identity, diasporic experiences, language, and legal and political identity after taking citizenship.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">German settlers of Queensland, Logan River, Maroochy, German migration to Queensland, Crown Lands Acts, naturalization, citizenship, cultural identity, assimilation.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of one-dimensional quantum gases</field><field name="creator">Andrew Sykes</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study the physics of quantum many-body systems confined to one-dimensional geometries. The work was motivated by the recent success of experimentalists in developing atom traps, capable of restricting the motion of the individual atoms to a single spatial dimension. Specifically, we look at aspects of the one-dimensional Bose gas including; excitation spectrum, correlation functions, and dynamical behaviour. In Chapter \ref{ch:excitation1D} we consider the Lieb-Liniger model of interacting bosons in one-dimension. We numerically solve the equations arising from the Bethe ansatz solution for the exact many-body wave function in a finite-size system of up to twenty particles for attractive interactions. We discuss novel features of the solutions, including deviations from the well-known string solutions due to finite size effects. We present excited state string solutions in the limit of strong interactions and discuss their physical interpretation, as well as the characteristics of the quantum phase transition that occurs as a function of interaction strength in the mean-field limit. Our results are compared to those obtained via exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in a truncated basis. In Chapter \ref{ch:g2} we analytically calculate the spatial nonlocal pair correlation function for an interacting uniform one dimensional Bose gas at finite temperature and propose an experimental method to measure nonlocal correlations. Our results span six different physical realms, including the weakly and strongly interacting regimes. We show explicitly that the characteristic correlation lengths are given by one of four length scales: the thermal de Broglie wavelength, the mean interparticle separation, the healing length, or the phase coherence length. In all regimes, we identify the profound role of interactions and find that under certain conditions the pair correlation may develop a global maximum at a finite interparticle separation due to the competition between repulsive interactions and thermal effects. In Chapter \ref{ch:casimirdrag} we study the drag force below the critical velocity for obstacles moving in a superfluid. The absence of drag is well established in the context of the mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii theory. We calculate the next order correction due to quantum and thermal fluctuations and find a non-zero force acting on a delta-function impurity moving through a quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate at all subcritical velocities and at all temperatures. The force occurs due to an imbalance in the Doppler shifts of reflected quantum fluctuations from either side of the impurity. Our calculation is based on a consistent extension of Bogoliubov theory to second order in the interaction strength, and finds new analytic solutions to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for a gray soliton. In Chapter \ref{ch:solitons} we study the effect of quantum noise on the stability of a soliton. We find the soliton solutions exactly define the reflectionless potentials of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. This results in complete stability of the solitons in a purely one dimensional system. We look at the modifications to the density profile of a black soliton due to quantum fluctuations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Many-body quantum theory, one-dimensional, ultra-cold atoms, Bose-Einstein condensation, superfluidity, solitons</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF WASTEWATER FROM ETHANOL DISTILLATION (SPENT WASH/ VINASSE) AS A SOIL AMELIORANT (ORGANIC-CLAY NUTRIENTS)</field><field name="creator">Wannipa Soda</field><field name="description">Abstract The chemical characteristics of spent wash, an effluent from the distillation of ethanol from molasses, can vary, depending on the initial feed stock and the operations of the factory. Spent wash from Australia contained large quantities of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), K, N and Cl with moderate to low concentrations of Ca, Mg, Na, and S, and small amounts of trace elements (Fe, Al, Mn, Cu, Zn). Spent wash from Thailand was obtained from whisky distillation and generally had similar chemical attributes to the spent wash from ethanol production, although the Zn concentration was much higher (399-974 mg Zn L-1). Large differences in EC and pH were found between Australian (pH: 4.08-4.49; EC: 40.4-42.2 dS m-1) and Thai spent wash (pH: 7.86-9.20; EC: 11.3-82.4 dS m-1). However, the high concentration of K in spent wash from both manufacturing processes indicates the unique chemical characteristic of wastewater produced from molasses-based distillation. While chemical characterisations of spent wash have shown its potential value as a fertilizer, its utility needs to be more practical than by direct application. This is due to its dilute nature, associated with the presence of organic carbon (OC) and nutrients in soluble form, thus making direct application susceptible to leaching losses of nutrients, especially in soils of low cation exchange capacity (CEC). It was hypothesized that capturing OC and nutrients on a high activity exchanger would overcome this problem. Since the charge on organic components in spent wash is important to the capturing process, pH manipulation is one of the major factors affecting the efficiency of this capture. The study of the influence of pH on development of charge on organic components in spent wash was undertaken using potentiometric titration. The potentiometric titration, and derived pH buffer curve, showed that the organic components in spent wash comprised a wide range of ionizable organic functional groups behaving like a mix of weak acids. While the inflection point (s) could not be obtained from the potentriometric titration, the absorbance of spent wash in the UV waveband (250 to 400 nm) confirmed the presence of phenolic groups in spent wash. The charge on organic components in spent wash was strongly pH dependent, and highest in the pH range of 4.0-5.0. The manipulation of pH and salt concentration (EC) was shown to have an effect on flocculation/dispersion and it is inferred that this was due to changes in the molecular arrangement of organic components in spent wash. A coiled configuration is suggested at acidic pH, whereas a linear flexible configuration and macromolecular structure tending to occur at neutral and alkaline pH respectively. Ca-saturated bentonite, originally sourced from Mantuan Downs, Central Queensland, was used in an investigation of the capture of OC and nutrients from Sarina spent wash at different pH values (4.5, 6.0, 8.0). This study demonstrated that manipulation of pH and electrolyte concentration had a small effect on adsorption of OC by the clay, probably the result of effects on the charge characteristics of both clay mineral surfaces and organic molecules and also on molecular sizes of the dissolved organic matter (DOM). The highest absorption of OC was only 28% for dewatered spent wash, suggesting Ca-saturated bentonite may not be a strong sorbent for DOM from a wastewater of high EC and which contains high concentration of DOC of the composition found in spent wash. The study of the adsorption of K by bentonite in a pure inorganic system (without DOM) indicated sufficiently high concentrations of K can compete with divalent Ca2+ for exchange sites on the clay surface. The adsorption of K in an organic system (the DOM component in spent wash) showed that DOM had a positive influence on adsorption of inorganic ions (e.g. K+). Characterisation of the spent wash/ clay mixture demonstrated its potential to be used as a soil ameliorant on the basis of the large quantity of OC and nutrients it contained (especially N and K). Wet and dry organic clays were produced and assessed as ameliorants in a glasshouse trial using forage oat (Avena sativa var. Coolobah) as test species. This pot study indicated a positive influence of application of either wet or dry organic clay on crop biomass at the high application rate (equivalent to 40 tonnes ha-1). The high proportional K recovery from this high application rate application suggests that organic clays can be used as K fertilizer. The crop nutrient uptake data also indicated its use as a source of S and Mn.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords wastewater, spent wash, vinasse, ethanol distillation, dissolved organic molecule (DOM), potassium (K), adsorption of organic matter (OM) on clay, bentonite, organic clay, soil ameliorant.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of c-Src in E-Cadherin Activity</field><field name="creator">Robert Mclachlan</field><field name="description">Cadherin-based cell-cell contacts are prominent sites for phosphotyrosine signalling, being enriched in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. The functional interplay between cadherin adhesion and tyrosine kinase signalling, however, is complex and incompletely understood. In my thesis I have tested the hypothesis that c-Src contributes positively to cadherin biology by functioning as part of an adhesion activated cell-signalling pathway. I found that c-Src is active at both established and reforming cell-cell contacts, and c-Src can be activated by homophilic ligation of the adhesion receptor. However, c-Src has a biphasic impact on cadherin function, exerting a positive supportive role at lower signal strengths, but inhibiting function at high signal strengths. Inhibiting c-Src under circumstances when it is activated by cadherin adhesion decreased several measures of cadherin function. This suggests that the cadherin-activated c-Src signalling pathway serves positively to support cadherin function, while quantitative changes in signal strength may result in qualitative differences in functional outcome. Finally, my data implicated PI3-kinase signalling and cortactin as potential targets for cadherin-activated c-Src signalling. By inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatases with pervanadate, I found that tyrosine phosphatase activity and not just protein binding was required to stimulate Src activity in response to cadherin ligation. I identified the tyrosine phosphatase RPTP&#945; as a possible regulator of cadherin-activated Src signalling. RPTP&#945; localises to cell-cell adhesions and it is found in a complex with E-cadherin and c-Src. Furthermore, knockdown of RPTP&#945; disrupted the integrity of cadherin-based contacts and the activity of Src at these cell-cell contacts. This suggests that in response to cadherin-homophilic ligation PTP activity is required to stimulate Src signalling. Finally, I identified a novel pathway by which aberrant growth factor signalling could be downregulating cadherin function and promoting the invasion of epithelial cells. Stimulating cells with high levels of EGF revealed that aberrant epidermal growth factor signalling could disrupt cadherin-activated cell signalling. The integrity of cadherin-based contacts and the activity of Src at the cell-cell contacts were both disrupted in the presence of high levels of EGF. Analysis of E-cadherin and RPTP&#945; immunoprecipitates suggested that activation of cadherin-bound EGFR might disrupt Src activation by displacing E-cadherin-RPTP&#945; binding. Finally, analysing the subcellular distribution of these proteins revealed that, in response to high levels of EGF, E-cadherin, &#946;-catenin, EGFR and pEGFR are internalised together in phospho-cortactin-rich endosomal-like structures. Therefore I propose that E-cadherin adhesion activates a cell-signalling pathway involving c-Src that functions to dynamically regulate the actin cytoskeleton and to maintain the adhesive strength of cell-cell adhesions. Perturbation of cadherin-activated Src signalling downregulates cadherin function and promotes the disassembly of cell-cell adhesive contacts. The concept of a cadherin-activated Src signalling pathway provides a new way to think about cadherin biology. Instead of merely functioning as passive glue holding two cells together, E-cadherin functions as an adhesion-activated signalling receptor. Dysregulation of E-cadherin-activated Src signalling and downregulation of cell-cell adhesions could be a mechanism promoting the invasion and metastasis of epithelial tumours.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">E-cadherin</field><field name="subject">Src</field><field name="subject">Cell-Cell Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">RPTP&#945;</field><field name="subject">Receptor Crosstalk</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Group opinion change and reintegration of deviant group members</field><field name="creator">Khai Huei Chan</field><field name="description">The present thesis investigates two theoretically novel processes of change in groups relevant to agents for change. Specifically, it examines the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on group members&#8217; evaluation of ingroup change-agents. Group opinion change is operationalized as the group adopting the position advocated by a change-agent, and reintegration is operationalized as the group responding more positively towards a change-agent. These formulations of change processes within groups extend past theorizing in opinion deviance research (e.g., Festinger, 1950; Schachter, 1951; Marques &amp; Paez, 1994) by a) examining how contextual differences that result from changes in the group may affect group members&#8217; reactions to opinion deviates, and b) considering contingencies that result in acceptance or rejection of change-agents and their messages. In addition, this thesis investigates the psychological processes that may mediate and moderate the effects of group opinion change and reintegration on appraisals of change-agents. Specifically, it considers attributed motives of change-agents (i.e., perceived constructiveness; Hornsey, 2005), and target prototypicality (e.g., Hogg, 1993; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, &amp; Wetherell, 1987) as two possible mediators of these novel effects. Finally, group members&#8217; identification with the group is examined as a moderator of these processes. Chapter 3 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of group opinion change on the evaluation of change-agents. Experiment 1 (N=100) was a scenario-based study that had a change-agent express a non-conformist view of giving water to an outgroup state at a time when the ingroup state was experiencing a water crisis. Experiment 2 (N=103) was a scenario-based study that looked at a change-agent who expressed pro-immigration views to the ingroup country at an earlier time when popular attitudes toward immigration were poor. In both experiments the deviants were marginalized initially because they endorsed non-conformist opinions. Depending on the condition, group opinions either shifted toward the positions advocated by the deviants or remained unchanged. Results showed group members&#8217; target evaluations shifted as a function of group opinion change. Target evaluations became less favourable in Experiment 1, and more favourable in Experiment 2. There also was evidence that increased perceived constructiveness mediated more favourable target evaluations in Experiment 2. Chapter 4 presents the first two experiments that tested the effects of reintegration and group members&#8217; identification on the evaluation of change-agents. Both Experiments 3 (N=103) and 4 (N=94) involved a scenario where there was a severe drought in the ingroup state. In Experiment 3, a deviant politician argued for more investment on water infrastructure 10 years earlier when water shortage was not a critical problem. Thus, the politician expressed a minority opinion. In Experiment 4, a deviant water commissioner expressed a controversial opinion to give water to an outgroup state at the height of the drought. Both deviants were marginalized/excluded initially by the group. Reintegration was manipulated by showing that popular support for the deviant had increased (Experiment 3) or the deviant was reinstated (Experiment 4), or the group did not increase support for the deviant at all (not reintegrated). Results showed that high identifiers evaluated the deviant less positively, and perceived the deviant as more destructive after he or she was reintegrated than when marginalization continued. Further, perceived destructiveness mediated the effects of reintegration and identification on trait evaluations. Experiment 4 also showed that high identifiers were less willing to support change after the deviant was reintegrated, than when marginalization continued. Finally, Chapter 5 tested the interactive effects of group opinion change and reintegration on evaluation of change-agents. I also assessed group members&#8217; responses to change-agents in light of the group&#8217;s resistance to change even though the change-agents were right and the groups were wrong. Experiment 5 was a scenario-based study in a minimal-groups situation that had a deviant arguing for a more equitable research funding than the existing distribution. Experiment 6 was a scenario-based study on the disagreement between Galileo Galilei and the Catholic Church on planetary motion. Again, the deviants initially were marginalized by the groups. For opinion change, the groups either adopted or rejected the deviants&#8217; opinions. For reintegration, the groups either treated the deviants more favourably or continued to reject them. Results showed that either opinion change or reintegration was sufficient to defuse negativity towards the deviants. More importantly, group members continued mistreating the deviants when the groups rejected opinion change and reintegration. That is, negativity towards the deviants was highest when opinion was unchanged, and marginalization continued. Overall, this thesis shows that group members&#8217; evaluations of deviant agents for change can shift as a function of group opinion change and reintegration. Group opinion change and/or reintegration defuse negativity toward change-agents in the absence of psychological threat (i.e., perceived destructiveness). However, if threat is present, opinion change or reintegration may ironically elicit more group members&#8217; negativity towards these targets. This thesis also contributes to the literature by showing how change promotes or inhibits group members&#8217; endorsement of change-agents.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Deviance</field><field name="subject">Dissent</field><field name="subject">Group Opinion change</field><field name="subject">Deviant Reintegration</field><field name="subject">Rejection</field><field name="subject">Threat</field><field name="subject">Criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of novel Australian rhabdoviruses isolated from vertebrates and insects</field><field name="creator">Aneta Gubala</field><field name="description">As an outcome of very active arbovirus monitoring programs that began in Australia in the 1950s, some of the most diverse and unusual rhabdoviruses in the world have been isolated from this continent. These novel rhabdoviruses represent an important and valuable pool of highly diverse viruses; however, most of them have remained poorly characterised. In light of the significant disease potential of numerous rhabdoviruses, the characterisation of novel rhabdoviruses is indispensable for threat assessment to livestock, wildlife and humans and preparedness for outbreaks. The genetic characterisation of novel viruses is also an essential step for the development of molecular detection assays for improved monitoring and investigations into unidentified disease cases. In this study, the complete genomes of four novel rhabdoviruses have been sequenced and a fifth is close to completion. The substantial new data generated has significantly extended the understanding of the biology and evolution of the Rhabdoviridae. Wongabel virus (WONV), isolated from the biting midge Culicoides austropalpalis, was found to contain a unique genome structure encoding ten genes, including five novel genes (Chapter 2). Analysis by western blotting suggested that four out of the five novel genes were expressed in infected cell cultures. Ngaingan virus (NGAV), isolated from Culicoides brevitarsis, was found to have the largest genome of any rhabdovirus sequenced to date, and with thirteen genes has the largest number of genes of any (-) ssRNA virus sequenced to date (Chapter 3). Seven of the thirteen genes are novel. Similar to viruses in the genus Ephemerovirus (bovine ephemeral fever virus and Adelaide River virus), NGAV contains a second glycoprotein with an unknown function. Phylogenetic analysis places this virus alongside WONV and the north-American bird and mosquito-associated Flanders virus within the Hart Park group that remains to be classified by the ICTV. Screening of various wildlife and livestock sera collected in northern Australia indicated a strong association of NGAV with macropods. Tibrogargan virus (TIBV) and Coastal Plains virus (CPV) were isolated from cattle and Culicoides brevitarsis (TIBV). Past serological surveys reported both viruses to be highly prevalent in cattle in northern Australia and demonstrated that the two viruses share a relatively close relationship at the antigenic level. The genomic analyses revealed that these two viruses have a unique genome organization, with three additional genes (Chapter 4). These additional genes are highly diverged at the sequence level but the encoded putative proteins share a significant conservation of secondary structure elements. The sequencing of these two related viruses has provided a unique opportunity to gain insights into the characteristics and evolution of novel proteins in two different rhabdoviruses. Phylogenetic analyses showed that TIBV and CPV form an independent cluster which does not appear to belong to any of the current genera, but which is most closely related to the genus Ephemerovirus based on N protein analysis. Although neither virus has been associated with disease, a serological survey of various animal sera collected in northern Australia showed that these viruses are currently highly prevalent in sentinel cattle and buffalo. Oak Vale virus (OVRV) was isolated from mosquitoes, Culex edwardsi and Ochlerotatus vigilax, from two geographically diverse regions of Australia located approximately 3000 km apart. The genome of OVRV was found to contain only one novel gene (Chapter 5). Comparatively, the genome of this virus is much less complex than the others in this study, but this virus displays considerable divergence from all other rhabdoviruses. A high seroprevalence for this virus was found in the feral pig population in northern Australia. The data generated from this study represents a considerable increase in the quantity of genetic data available for this viral family, and has revealed the existence of a large number of previously unidentified genes, highlighting that that the potential for complexity within the prototype genomic model of a rhabdovirus is much greater than previously thought. The novel nature of the additional genes provides grounds for further research into rhabdovirus evolution. Analysis of this new data suggests that these viruses cannot be classified into existing genera under the current criteria and it is clear that the taxonomy of the Rhabdoviridae requires revision. The observation that these viruses are currently circulating in livestock and wildlife in northern Australia accentuates the need for closer monitoring of animals and the need for further study of this diverse and fascinating group of viruses.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">virus, rhabdovirus, rhabdoviridae, arbovirus, genetics, evolution, sequencing, characterisation,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineered Surfaces for Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering</field><field name="creator">Peter George</field><field name="description">The interaction of materials with biological systems is of critical importance to a vast number of applications from medical implants, tissue engineering scaffolds, blood-contacting devices, cell-culture products, as well as many other products in industries as diverse as agriculture. This thesis describes a method for the modification of biomaterial surfaces and the generation of tissue engineering scaffolds that utilises the self assembly of poly (styrene)-block-poly (ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) block copolymers. Block copolymers consist of alternating segments of two or more chemically distinct polymers. The salient feature of these materials is their ability to self organise into a wide range of micro-phase separated structures generating patterned surfaces that have domain sizes in the order of 10-100nm. Further, it is also possible to specifically functionalise only one segment of the block copolymer, providing a means to precisely locate specific biological signals within the 10-100nm domains of a nano-patterned surface, formed via the programmed micro-phase separation of the block copolymer system. The density and spatial location of signalling molecules can be controlled by altering several variables, such as block length, block asymmetry, as well as processing parameters, providing the potential to authentically emulate the cellular micro to nano-environment and thus greatly improving on existing biomaterial and tissue engineering technologies. This thesis achieved several aims as outlined below; Developed methods to control the self-assembly of PS-PEO block copolymers and generate nano-patterned surfaces and scaffolds with utility for biomaterials applications. PS-PEO diblock copolymers were blended with polystyrene (PS) homopolymer and spin cast, resulting in the rapid self-assembly of vertically oriented PEO cylinders in a matrix of PS. Due to the kinetically constrained phase-separation of the system, increasing addition of homopolymer is shown to reduce the diameter of the PEO domains. This outcome provides a simple method that requires the adjustment of a single variable to tune the size of vertically oriented PEO domains between 10-100nm. Polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering were manufactured via a method that combines macro-scale temperature induced phase separation with micro-phase separation of block copolymers. The phase behaviour of these polymer-solvent systems is described, and potential mechanisms leading to this spectacular structure formation are presented. The result is highly porous scaffolds with surfaces comprised of nano-scale self-assembled block copolymer domains, representing a significant advance in currently available technologies. Characterised the properties of these unique nano-structured materials as well as their interaction with proteinaceous fluids and cells. Nano-patterned PS-PEO self-assembled surfaces showed a significant reduction in protein adsorption compared to control PS surfaces. The adhesion of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells was shown to be significantly affected by the surface coverage of PEO nano-domains formed by copolymer self-assembly. These nano-islands, when presented at high number density (almost 1000 domains per square micron), were shown to completely prevent cellular attachment, even though small amounts of protein were able to bind to the surface. In order to understand the mechanism by which these surfaces resisted protein and cellular adsorption we utilised neutron reflection to study their solvation and swelling properties. The results indicate that the PEO domains are highly solvated in water; however, the PEO chains do not extend into the solvent but remain in their isolated domains. The data supports growing evidence that the key mechanism by which PEO prevents protein adsorption is the blocking of protein adsorption sites. Control the nano-scale presentation of cellular adhesion and other biological molecules via the self-assembly of functionalised PS-PEO block copolymers Precise control over the nano-scale presentation of adhesion molecules and other biological factors represents a new frontier for biomaterials science. Recently, the control of integrin spacing and cellular shape has been shown to affect fundamental biological processes, including differentiation and apoptosis. We present the self-assembly of maleimide functionalised PS-PEO copolymers as a simple, yet highly precise method for controlling the position of cellular adhesion molecules. By controlling the phase separation of the functional PS-PEO block copolymer we alter the nano-scale (on PEO islands of 8-14 nm in size) presentation of the adhesion peptide, GRGDS, decreasing lateral spacing from 62 nm to 44 nm and increasing the number density from ~ 450 to ~ 900 islands per um2. The results indicate that the spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts increases as the spacing between islands of RGD binding peptides decreases. Further, the same functional PS-PEO surfaces were utilised to immobilise poly-histidine tagged proteins and ECM fragments. The technologies developed in this thesis aim to improve on several weaknesses of existing biomaterials, in particular, directing cellular behaviour on surfaces, and within tissue engineering scaffolds, but also, on the prevention of fouling of biomaterials via non-specific protein adsorption. The application of block copolymer self-assembly for biomaterial and tissue engineering systems described in this thesis has great potential as a platform technology for the investigation of fundamental cell-surface and protein-surface interactions as well as for use in existing and emerging biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Block copolymer</field><field name="subject">polystyrene-block-poly (ethylene oxide)</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnolgy</field><field name="subject">Surface Modification</field><field name="subject">Protein Adsorption</field><field name="subject">cell spreading</field><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">integrin</field><field name="subject">RGD</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Analysis of Islamic Conceptualisations of Press Freedom in Malaysia</field><field name="creator">Nerawi Sedu</field><field name="description">This research study investigated the conceptions of press freedom from the Islamic perspective. It examined how certain segments of Malaysian society, including government officers, religious leaders, members of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and members of political parties, perceive press freedom in their country. Compared to previous studies on media freedom or press freedom in Malaysia, this study offered a comprehensive analysis of variables significantly related to the conceptualisation and practice of press freedom, which include economic development, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and globalisation. One significant difference between this study and previous studies was the specific examination of Islamic conceptions of press freedom, which represents a major contribution to existing knowledge. As Malaysia is a complex multi-racial and multi-religious nation, factors such as national ideologies and cultural values were addressed when examining conceptions of press freedom. Due to the focus of the study, two types of framework were utilised: an Islamic theoretical framework and media theories developed by Western scholars. Methodologically, this study employed an ethnographic approach for analysing Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom. A combination of three qualitative research techniques - in-depth face-to-face interviews, examination of archival documents, and personal observations - was utilised to investigate the issues identified in relation to perceptions of press freedom in Malaysia. In-depth face-to-face interviews involved the participation of staff and members from ten organisations and individuals who were not affiliated with these organisations. The organisations involved in this study were: Ministry of Internal Security Malaysia (MOIS); Institute of Islamic Understanding Malaysia (IKIM); Islamic Da&#8217;wah Foundation Malaysia (YADIM); Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia (ABIM); Pertubuhan Jamaah Islah Malaysia (JIM); Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ); Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM); Islamic Party of Malaysia (PAS), People&#8217;s Justice Party (PKR); and Puteri UMNO. The archival documents analysed in this study were gathered from these ten organisations. However, due to certain organisational policies and security concerns, personal observations were only conducted at eight organisations, IKIM, YADIM, ABIM, JIM, CIJ, SUARAM, PAS and PKR. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the data analysis were triangulated to ascertain the extent to which the information obtained was consistent or inconsistent across sources. The findings of the study showed that there were diverse views among respondents on what constitutes an Islamic press freedom in a multi-racial and multi-religious Malaysia. Due to the different levels of Islamic understanding and divergent interpretations of Islam among Muslims, especially among members of political parties, this study also found that the Islamic theory of press freedom is a highly contested concept. More often than not, the respondents of these organisations claimed that Islamic conceptualisations of press freedom should be based on their personal versions of Islam.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom, Islamic perspective, tawhid, conservatism, liberalism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Material Culture and Behaviour in Pleistocene Sahul: Examining the Archaeological Representation of Pleistocene Behavioural Modernity in Sahul</field><field name="creator">Michelle Langley</field><field name="description">Sahul, the combined landmass of Australia and New Guinea, provides a record of behavioural modernity extending over at least the last 50,000 years. Colonised solely by anatomically and behaviourally modern humans, this continent provides an alternative record in the investigation of behavioural modernity to the extensively studied Middle Stone Age African and Upper Palaeolithic Eurasian archaeological records. In the past, the archaeological record of behavioural modernity in Sahul has been described as simple, sparse and essentially different to those records of Africa and Eurasia. These differences have been attributed to either low population densities during the Pleistocene or the loss of behavioural &#8216;traits&#8217; on the journey from Africa to Sahul. While a number of studies have been undertaken, no single researcher has attempted to investigate the role of taphonomy and sampling on the representation of behavioural modernity in the archaeological record, despite Sahul being characterised by extreme environments, highly variable climates, and archaeologically, usually only small excavations. This study compiles the most complete record of chronology, evidence for behavioural modernity and excavation details for 223 Pleistocene sites yet attempted. It is also the most extensive dataset assembled for the examination of the issue of behavioural modernity on a single landmass. Site spatial and temporal distribution, site characteristics, excavations, absolute dating, preservation and sample size are examined to determine how the behavioural complexity of a modern human population is characterised on this isolated southern continent and the impact of taphonomy and archaeological sampling on that representation. Results demonstrate that preservation and sampling play a significant role in structuring the spatial and temporal representation of behavioural modernity in the archaeological record of Pleistocene Sahul. Contrary to previous findings, the evidence for behavioural modernity in Sahul is found to resemble the archaeological records of the African Middle Stone Age and Eurasian Upper Palaeolithic in terms of behaviour and artefact diversity. In terms of global narratives, these results also indicate that current understandings of behavioural modernity are incomplete and may misrepresent levels of behavioural complexity in early periods in some regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sahul, Pleistocene, behavioural modernity, modern cognition, material culture, taphonomy, sampling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Students' Higher Education Choice: Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour to Identify Key Choice Attributes by Segment</field><field name="creator">Sunita Prugsamatz</field><field name="description">Abstract This research develops and tests an application of the latest version of the expectancy-value model&#8212;the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), to a new context, that of higher education overseas enrolment choice. The study argues that TPB is well suited for modelling and predicting international students&#8217; university choice processes. Choosing a university in a foreign country is probably more difficult than making a domestic choice. While there has been some literature on undergraduate domestic university choice, scant attention has been directed at the understanding of international students&#8217; choice of universities. Past studies have looked mainly at factors that influence choice of programmes and destinations with little emphasis on the students&#8217; cognitive processes. Furthermore, these past models, intended to help predict student choice, have been limited to economics-based, pragmatic or statistical frameworks. Now, more than ever, this gap in the literature needs to be filled. International education is currently worth more than $4 billion a year. More and more universities today are increasingly dependent on overseas full fee paying student revenue, sometimes to an enormous and alarming extent. This competition and globalisation of higher education is forcing universities to better understand how students choose. A simple understanding of international student choice behaviour is not enough when so many universities are competing for vital revenues and market share. The Theory of Planned Behaviour, as a rigorous and comprehensive choice-model, well supported by hundreds of published studies, is proposed as a way forward to help better predict, segment and profile international students&#8217; university choices. This research attempts to answer the following three main research questions: 1. How do international students choose overseas universities? 2. How do international students&#8217; choice processes differ by culture? 3. Can TPB be applied in an international student choice context and can it usefully be applied for cross-cultural segmentation? Underpinning the development of the conceptual model presented are two research themes. The first of these themes investigates the choice processes of international students with respect to three main cognitive factors: attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The second theme of this research investigates the differences in choice processes between students from different national cultures with respect to attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control and behavioural intentions. It examines how the relationship between these constructs can help determine appropriate segments of international students. Collectively, these research themes lead to a new model for the choice process international students engage in when selecting an overseas university. The study conducted in this thesis involved a two-stage design. The first, qualitative, stage consisted of a pilot study (Study 1). The primary purpose of the pilot study, using semi-structured questionnaires, was to elicit the attributes to be addressed by the quantitative part of the research (Study 2). The second, quantitative, stage consisted of a questionnaire survey. A total sample of 500 potential international students from four countries (Norway, China, Thailand and India) was collected. Careful translation and cross-cultural measurement validity processes were followed. The findings provide insights into the three research questions proposed. Firstly, results indicate that choice for a potential international student is a complex, highly involved, cognitive and individualistic process. Findings also underscore the important influence of sources of information on students when choosing an overseas university. Additionally, this study concludes, for the first time in this research area, that information sources indirectly influence changes to students&#8217; intention through attitude or subjective norms, whereas prior research has skipped the detailed process and looked only at the direct influence of information sources on intention. Results of analyses on structural models show that attitude is the best indicator in predicting students&#8217; intentions to choose an overseas university, while perceived behavioural control contributes little toward predicting students&#8217; intention for the TPB model. However, perceived behavioural control showed a positive relationship with intentions for the total group. The more control a student feels he/she has, the more likely the formation of intentions to attend an overseas university. Secondly, the results of post hoc tests for multiple comparisons between groups showed differences between all cultural groups. This result meant that regardless of culture, differences in process or criteria weights can be found and so it is important to use a segmentation approach. The findings show that when marketers analyse the international student market as a whole, which is by grouping all the different country data together, this could result in serious &#8220;aggregation error,&#8221; i.e., when grouped data results are misleading because the groups are heterogeneous. Instead, the data must first be disaggregated by country and then by behavioural attributes, such as attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. In terms of measurement reliability and the structural fit of each model with the data, the results were positive. Finally, the present research confirms the usefulness of TPB as a choice model in the context of understanding international students&#8217; decision making process. The use of a rigorous cognitive model such as this offers insight to educational marketers on segmentation and positioning. Additionally, this research demonstrates that the choice process is complex and that the diversity of the choice process requires attention. If universities wish to continue to attract and retain international students, they must understand students&#8217; attitudes, normative beliefs, and control beliefs as well as the factors that influence their choice.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of planned behaviour, higher education, choice, international students, segmentation</field><field name="subject">Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classifications (ANZSRC) Marketing, Business and Management, (ERA Cluster Four: SBE) 150308 International Business 40%, 150506 Marketing Theory 179999 40% Psychology and Cognitive Sciences 20%</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hearing and Quality of Life in children with cancer</field><field name="creator">Josephine Manjaji</field><field name="description">The advances in cancer treatment for the last three decades have seen a significant improvement in survival following childhood cancer, with cure rates approaching 80% in some developed countries. However, most of these survivors develop long term side effects, such as ototoxicity, secondary to their medical treatment (surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy). Despite the varied nature of childhood cancer, existing studies show a high incidence of ototoxic hearing loss amongst young cancer survivors. A hearing loss caused by ototoxicity can have a negative impact on communication, speech and language development, cognitive and learning abilities, academic progress, psychosocial relationships and vocational opportunities. The purpose of the present study was to investigate firstly, the audiological habilitation management and ongoing communicative needs for these children and secondly, the perception of carers and their children about the effects and risks of cancer treatment on hearing, and the children&#8217;s quality of life. The participants in this study included 13 children (who received anti-cancer treatment for medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, osteosarcoma and astrocytoma) and 17 carers. Audiological assessment and management data were obtained by an audit of all children&#8217;s files held at respective hearing centres. Quality of life data were obtained through face to face interviews or by phone interview using the Sunshine Hearing Analysis (SHA) developed specifically for this population. The audiological assessment data showed that all child participants had audiometric configurations typical of an ototoxic hearing loss with poorer hearing thresholds in the high than in the low frequencies. All child participants required habilitation services provided by Australian Hearing, Education Queensland and State Health Services to different extents, which depend on the severity of the hearing loss. These habilitation services included provision of counselling by health and allied health professionals, amplification devices, special education services, learning support from advisory visiting teachers, speech therapy, occupational therapy and oncology outreach programmes. These services provided the most needed support to the affected children and their families to improve their quality of life. The SHA data revealed that child participants had better functioning in the social than in the emotional and physical domains, suggesting that they coped quite well in their social life, despite having the inevitable negative side effects arisen from their medical treatment. The child participants with a moderately-severe to severe high frequency hearing loss and those who were treated for medulloblastomas were found to have significantly reduced emotional functioning in a variety of listening situations when compared to their peers. The SHA data collected from carers of the young cancer survivors showed that the severity of the children&#8217;s hearing loss had a negative emotional effect on communication and quality of life of their children. In particular, carers of female child participants reported that their children demonstrated significantly lower functioning in the emotional domain than that reported by carers of the male child participants. In conclusion, although hearing loss caused by anticancer medical treatments is seldom a reason to stop treatment of cancer, the findings of the present study indicate that the resulting permanent hearing impairment can have a negative impact on children&#8217;s communication, learning at school and, consequently, their quality of life. These children should be given sufficient and appropriate ongoing habilitation services to reduce this impact and, hence, improve their quality of life.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hearing</field><field name="subject">Quality of life</field><field name="subject">children</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Searching the secretome of Opisthorchis viverrini for growth factor-like molecules</field><field name="creator">Michael Smout</field><field name="description">Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or cancer of the bile ducts, is extremely prevalent in people from Laos and Thailand whose staple diet is uncooked fish which harbour the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini. There is no stronger link between a parasite and cancer than that between O. viverrini and CCA. Indeed WHO data suggests that one in six infected people contract liver cancer derived from the fluke. In vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that the fluke&#8217;s excretory/secretory (ES) proteins are mitogenic and likely make significant contributions to the initiation of CCA. To identify these carcinogenic components I undertook two distinct yet related approaches - (1) traditional protein purification methods to separate ES products, specifically targeting mitogenic proteins, and, (2) bioinformatic screening of 5,000 expressed sequences tags (ESTs) and ES proteins characterized by shotgun proteomic approaches, searching for homologues of molecules that are associated with human cancers. The protein purification approach utilized a cell proliferation assay that I developed for measuring cell replication rates in NIH-3T3 fibroblast and human CCA (KKU-100) cell lines stimulated with ES products. ES products were separated by a combination of ion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, size exclusion and a final ion exchange polishing chromatography steps. ES products and chromatographically separated ES proteins were added to cultured cells to observe mitogenic activity. A four-step purification process resulted in the isolation of 23 and 31 kDa proteins that stimulated cell proliferation at just picomolar quantities. These proteins account for a very small proportion of the total protein biomass (6 ppm and 39 ppm respectively) secreted by the parasite. Their identities are currently being explored using alternate proteomic approaches. Some growth factors bind to heparin, so an alternative purification process was developed using a heparin affinity column to purify ES mitogens. In combination with ion exchange chromatography a 20 kDa heparin-binding protein was identified using tandem mass spectrometry as a member of the sperm-coating protein 65 (SCP)-like extracellular proteins, also called SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc766 (SCP/TAPS; Pfam accession number no. PF00188). The O. viverrini heparin-binding SCP/TAPs protein shared similarity with secreted proteins from other parasitic helminths including the hookworm activation-associated protein family, some of which are known to bind to host cells. In silico screening of the O. viverrini ESTs and ES peptides generated by mass spectrometry for proteins associated with cell proliferation and cancer revealed numerous secreted proteins of interest. One of these proteins shared identity with granulin, a vertebrate growth factor. The cDNA corresponding to this protein was termed Ov-grn-1. The predicted molecular characteristics of Ov-GRN-1 (isoelectric point and molecular weight) corresponded with the biochemical properties of the semi-purified mitogen that was chromatographically purified from ES products. Recombinant Ov-GRN-1 was expressed in E. coli in inclusion bodies and the purified denatured protein was refolded to produce a soluble protein. Refolded Ov-GRN-1 stimulated proliferation of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts at nanomolar concentrations and induced shape changes in affected cells. Antibodies raised to recombinant Ov-GRN-1 inhibited the ability of O. viverrini ES products to induce proliferation of fibroblasts and the KKU-100 CCA cell line in vitro, indicating that Ov-GRN-1 is the major growth factor present in O. viverrini ES products. This is the first report of a secreted growth factor from a parasitic worm that induces proliferation of host cells, and supports a role for this fluke protein in establishment of a tumourigenic environment that may ultimately manifest as CCA.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Opisthorchis viverrini</field><field name="subject">Liver Fluke</field><field name="subject">Cholangiocarcinoma</field><field name="subject">bile duct cancer</field><field name="subject">ES products</field><field name="subject">Parasite</field><field name="subject">granulin</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Mitogen</field><field name="subject">Carcinogen</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualization, design, and scaling of drop generation in coflow processes</field><field name="creator">Manuela Duxenneuner</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drop formation, coflow, monodispersity, scaling, dimensionless numbers, microfluidics, microPIV, hydroxypropyl-ether guar gum, Tween, sunflower oil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194990</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WISE USE PRINCIPLES FOR WETLAND MANAGEMENT: A CASE STUDY OF PEMALANG COASTAL AREA &#8211; CENTRAL JAVA INDONESIA</field><field name="creator">Hadi-suseno</field><field name="description">Wise use has been widely recognized as a central tenet of sustainable development in wetland management throughout the world. In 2005 the concept of wetland wise use was incorporated into the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) framework to highlight the importance of maintaining a balance between wetland utilization and maintenance of ecosystem diversity. However, the implementation of this framework has been less than effective due to a lack of official government support in terms of institutional and organisational arrangements and lack of local community engagement. The aim of this thesis was to explore the mental models of local communities and decision makers involved in wetland planning and management in Indonesia, as a means to unravel the barriers and opportunities for achieving more effective outcomes for both wetlands and local communities. The specific objectives were to better understand the mental models of the key actors involved in wetland management, as well as the broad policy, economic, social and cultural issues surrounding wetlands at multiple scales from local to national. The term mental models as used in this study referred to a collection of individual worldviews, values, beliefs and mindsets in relation to understanding human-wetland relationships. This thesis presents the findings from a case study of the mental models of community-based rehabilitation of coastal wetlands in Pemalang, Central Java. It drew from a constructivist and pragmatic research paradigm to illuminate the importance of understanding wetland wise use across the key stakeholders involved. The assumptions of the constructivist and pragmatic paradigms indicate that this approach is appropriate for gaining insight into the social and cultural context of communities in the Pemalang district. The research targeted all 110 community members, who were actively engaged in wetland rehabilitation in Pemalang coastal areas. Interviews were conducted with 22 key decision makers involved in wetland management. Systematic procedures were used to minimise the potential for bias that can be evident in interpretive research and to ensure that the findings represented accurate information regarding the phenomenon under investigation. Techniques that included face-to-face validity, triangulation, repeated and prolong observation were used to ensure the reliability and validity of the research. The data analysis used a grounded approach. Leximancer Software and Nvivo QSR analysis were used to enable the complexity of the phenomenon associated with wetland wise use within the community-based activities to be identified. A key finding of this research was that effective wetland management should incorporate community objectives that address economic, social and cultural issues. In particular, enhanced understanding of a range of social aspects is important in developing the stakeholders&#8217; ability to nurture and provide stewardship of wetlands and to contribute to management practices that are collectively endorsed and coordinated and are socially accepted across the stakeholders involved. Decision makers viewed wetlands and their wise use on the basis of the relevant regulatory framework and had dominant anthropocentric orientations. The communities&#8217; concerns about subsistence were the main drivers in all members who were engaged in wetland rehabilitation programs (i.e. seaweed and crab farmers, and shrimp paste makers). The community also prioritised cultural and traditional values in addressing wetland wise use. The local Pemalang communities displayed a combination of both anthropocentric and ecocentric worldviews. Comparisons across the community groups studied revealed that fish farmers&#8217; mental models tended toward ecocentric worldviews, whereas the crab farmers and shrimp paste makers displayed strongly anthropocentric worldviews and utilitarian values concerning the meaning of wetlands and their wise use. In contrast, the decision makers&#8217; mental models related to wetland wise use implementation showed a strong anthropocentric worldview, which was oriented to the optimisation of land use functions and compliance with the regulatory framework. This research is important as it combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches, including interviews and participant observation to provide rich descriptions and a deeper understanding of stakeholders&#8217; mental models. By understanding these mental models, the views of the stakeholders can be more closely aligned with a stewarding and nurturing approach towards the environment. A key recommendation is the need to re-capitalise the existing National Committee of Wetland Management, through providing a more effective regulatory framework that accommodates various government regulations and integrates this with other levels of government (i.e. provincial and local). Stakeholder capacity building can be improved through encouraging and supporting local government involvement in the international network on wetland management. These findings also suggest that there is the need to support local communities in their management of wetlands by applying programs that incorporate local values, including traditional practices. Incentives should be generated through incorporating the existing international program such as bio-right entitlements for the community and introducing microfinance practices that are currently being widely practised in many less developed nations. The integration of these findings will provide insights and opportunity for more effective wetland wise use in Indonesia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">05 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Wetland, wetland wise use, mental model, Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Material exchange in mangroves during tidal inundation</field><field name="creator">Maria Adame Vivanco</field><field name="description">Coastal wetlands dominated by mangroves provide important ecological services to the coastal zone, many of which are associated with tidal inundation . In this study I investigated whether all coastal wetlands provide similar ecosystem services, or whether these varied depending on their geomorphological setting and the eutrophication level of the floodwater. Sampling was conducted over two years with significantly different levels of rainfall over six estuaries in Southeast Queensland, Australia. Sediment, nutrient and carbon exchange were investigated in tidal and riverine estuaries dominated by mangrove forests. The estuaries selected also comprised a gradient from low mesotrophic to low eutrophic. Spatial variation within the coastal wetlands was also investigated, comparing nutrient exchange in the low and high intertidal cyanobacteria mat . To assess sediment exchange, I measured retention of total suspended solids and sedimentation rates. Additionally, in order to assess the origin of sediment deposited in mangroves, glomalin, a novel terrestrial soil carbon (C) tracer, was used. Nutrient and C exchange were quantified by comparison of concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrogen oxides (NOx--N), ammonium (NH4+) total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic C (DOC) in water entering and leaving the mangroves during complete tidal cycles (3 tidal cycles in 6 estuaries for 2 years). Finally, the biogeochemical function of the cyanobacteria mat was measured through experiments investigating nitrogen fixation (N) and nutrient exchange in the extensive mats in the Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia. My results show that the seaward fringe mangrove retains the majority of sediment entering the wetland during a tidal cycle accounting for 52.5 &#177; 12.5 % of the total sedimentation (fringe mangrove + scrub mangrove + saltmarsh/ cyanobacteria mat). Geomorphological setting had a stronger influence on spatial patterns of deposition than on sedimentation rates. Riverine mangroves had more homogeneous distribution of sediments across the intertidal zone than tidal mangroves, where most sedimentation occurred in the seaward fringe mangrove zone. The presence of glomalin in sediments, and thus the relative importance of terrigenous sediment, was strongly influenced by geomorphological setting. Glomalin was primarily delivered to riverine mangroves and deposited within the scrub mangrove zone, while tidal mangroves received less glomalin during tidal inundation and most of it was deposited within the fringe mangrove zone. Overall, NOx--N concentrations decreased in the floodwater after flooding the coastal wetland, suggesting that these ecosystems act as sinks of dissolved NOx--N during tidal inundation. In average, NOx--N concentrations in the floodwater decreased 28 %. Additionally, during periods of high rainfall the decrease in nutrient concentrations was more pronounced, and not only NOx--N but also SRP and NH4+ concentrations decreased to up to 51 % and 83 %, respectively. My results suggest that rainfall enhances nutrient removal by coastal wetlands in the region. Geomorphological setting also affected nutrient removal. Riverine mangroves received stronger nutrient pulses, which resulted in strongest rates of nutrient removal during tidal inundation. Nutrient removal was closely related to the nutrient concentration of the floodwater: high nutrient removal occurred when floodwater was rich in nutrients. The C entering the wetland in the floodwater was mainly composed of DOC and its exchange did not vary among sites with differing geomorphological setting. However, DOC exchange was strongly affected by the water quality of floodwater inundating the coastal wetland. DOC concentrations were higher in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH4+ and SRP, suggesting DOC import. Contrary, DOC concentrations were lower in the flood compared to the ebb tide in sites flooded by water high in C, NH4+ and SRP, suggesting DOC export. The high intertidal cyanobacteria mat was important in regulating N fluxes in coastal wetlands. In the arid Exmouth Gulf, where cyanobacteria mats are abundant, nitrogen fixation rates were 4.9 &#177; 3.2 nmol cm-1 h-1. Cyanobacteria mats also removed N from the floodwater in the form of NOx--N (0.47 &#177; 0.45 g m-2 h-1) and NH4+ (0.31 &#177; 0.02 g m-2 h-1). N fixation and nutrient removal from the floodwater was highly variable spatially and temporally. N fixation rates were highest during the day in the mat situated at low tidal elevations. Overall, I found that the material exchange in coastal wetlands is variable within the coastal zone as a result of natural factors, such as geomorphology, vegetation composition and rainfall. But material exchange in wetlands is also affected by anthropogenic factors, particularly eutrophication. From all these factors, eutrophication of the floodwater appears to be the most critical, shifting the mangrove function from a DOC source to a nutrient and DOC sink. Approximate thresholds of nutrient and C concentrations in the floodwater that are likely to trigger shifts in ecosystem function in coastal wetlands in Southeast Queensland, and thus in the ecosystem services they provide, are 0.02 mg L-1 of SRP, 0.04 mg L-1 of NH4+ and 7.5 mg L-1 of DOC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coastal wetlands, mangroves, tidal exchange, nutrients, carbon, nutrient pollution, eutrophication, ecosystem services</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultures of Authenticity: Popular Music, Food Television, and Travel Writing</field><field name="creator">John Gunders</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the way in which the concept of authenticity is mobilised throughout popular cultural productions as a politically informed way of constructing value and meaning. It posits authenticity as a cultural category, the composition of which shifts according to the discursive and cultural contexts within which it operates, but whose significance lies in its capacity to signify the genuine, the real, and the fundamental. The thesis further proposes that three discourses are predominant in their participation in the construction and significance of authenticity: community, the natural, and creativity. Through a series of three case-study chapters, the thesis tracks this definition through extended analyses of a variety of cultural texts of different genres and media, and in different topic areas. First it examines the discourses of community and creativity in relation to popular music, drawing on texts such as video clips and film, journalistic writing, and fan discussions, in order to demonstrate that fan communities draw on the commonality of experience and the expressed creativity and skill of the performer in order to draw their own boundaries around what they consider to be authentic and inauthentic. Second, it looks at the discourses of the natural and of community in relation to food television and theorises that a fundamental meaning within the discourses of community&#8212;tradition&#8212;is at the heart of many valorised food cultures, and that this valorisation is played up in most televisual texts concerning food. Finally, the thesis examines the discourses of community and the natural in relation to travel writing, looking closely at the subgenre of the &#8220;villa book,&#8221; and claiming that the success of the subgenre is largely due to the intersection of the two key discourses. Similarly, the discourses of community and the natural are obvious within the practices of package-tourism, particularly within online discussions of this sort of travel. The thesis argues that in spite of an academic suspicion about authenticity as a valuing and explanatory mechanism, there is widespread use of the themes of authenticity&#8212;largely untheorised and undefined&#8212;within popular culture, and that the academy ignores these constructions at its peril. This thesis makes this examination, not in defence of authenticity as an essential, objective fact, but as a powerful, and largely unexamined, explanatory construction that is at the heart of what many people in this society consider important.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">authenticity</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">food television</field><field name="subject">travel writing</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the impacts of Devil Facial Tumour Disease in wild Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) populations to inform management decisions</field><field name="creator">Shelly Lachish</field><field name="description">Infectious diseases are increasingly being recognised as significant threatening processes in conservation biology. Developing strategies to effectively manage infectious diseases in wildlife is, therefore, of the utmost importance to the maintenance of global biodiversity. The effective management of infectious diseases relies on understanding the ecology of the host, the epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen and the impacts of the pathogen on the host population. However, for most wildlife-disease systems this information remains poorly understood. This is particularly true for endangered species threatened by novel infectious agents as opportunities to observe and assess disease impacts and host-pathogen dynamics in the wild are limited. The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), the world&#8217;s largest carnivorous marsupial, is threatened with extinction as a result of an epidemic of an emerging disease, a fatal infectious cancer known as Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD). In this thesis I capitalised on a unique dataset from a population of Tasmanian devils where disease arrived part-way through an intensive longitudinal study, and utilised existing genetic samples collected prior to DFTD outbreak, to determine the impact of DFTD on the demography, population dynamics, genetic diversity and population genetic structure of wild Tasmanian devils. I then used this knowledge of the impacts of DFTD impacts in an unmanaged population to evaluate the effectiveness of a disease management trial involving the selective culling of infected individuals. I employed mark-recapture models to investigate the impact of DFTD on age-specific and sex-specific apparent survival rates, to examine the pattern of variation in infection rates (force of infection), and to investigate the impact of DFTD on population growth rate. I investigated demography, life-history traits and morphometric parameters of infected and uninfected individuals to determine the impacts of DFTD on age-structure and sex-structure, female fecundity and individual growth rates. I used this information to assess the population&#8217;s ability to respond to low population densities and to compensate for the detrimental impacts of DFTD. To determine the genetic consequences of disease-induced population decline I used microsatellite DNA to compare genetic diversity, population genetic structure and dispersal patterns in three Tasmanian devil populations prior to and following DFTD outbreaks. Capture-mark-recapture analyses revealed that the arrival of DFTD triggered an immediate decline in apparent survival rates of devils, the rate of which was predicted well by the increase in disease prevalence in the population over time. Transition rates of healthy individuals to the diseased class (the force of infection) increased in relation to disease prevalence, while the arrival of DFTD coincided with a marked and ongoing decline in the population growth rate. There was a significant change to the age structure following the arrival of DFTD. This shift to a younger population was caused by the loss of older individuals as a direct consequence of DFTD-driven declines in adult survival rates. Evidence of reproductive compensation in response to these disease impacts was observed via a reduction in the age of sexual maturity of females over time. However, widespread precocial breeding in devils was precluded by physiological and ecological constraints that limited the ability of one year olds to breed. Using temporally-replicated spatial genetic data, I found evidence of increased inbreeding following DFTD arrival and greater population genetic differentiation in post-disease populations. These changes appeared to be driven by a combination of selection and altered dispersal patterns of females in DFTD-affected populations. Comparison of demographic and epidemiological parameters indicative of disease progression and impact between the managed and unmanaged populations revealed that selective culling of infected individuals neither slowed the rate of disease progression nor reduced the population level impacts of this debilitating disease; with culling mortality simply compensating for disease mortality. This thesis provides one of the few direct empirical evaluations of the impact of an emerging wildlife disease epidemic on a wild population. This thesis revealed that infectious diseases can result in major demographic and genetic changes in host populations over relatively few generations and short time-scales. Results showing dramatic and ongoing population declines and very limited population compensation in DFTD-affected populations indicate that DFTD poses a significant extinction risk for wild devil populations. Hence, this study confirms that host-specific pathogens can pose a significant extinction risk for wild species, even in the absence of alternate reservoir hosts, a finding critical to our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics. My thesis also highlights the potential negative interplay between disease susceptibility and host genetic variability, which is of utmost importance to the management of novel wildlife epizootics and the conservation of threatened wildlife in general. The thorough understanding of the ecology and impacts of DFTD in the wild obtained in this study has provided a solid base from which to both rigorously assess the outcome of management strategies and also formulate recommendations for the management of this disease in the wild. The lack of evidence for successful control of the DFTD epidemic in a wild population during the first phase of a selective culling experimental adaptive management approach, points to the need to implement a multi-faceted disease management program when attempting to control a novel infectious disease in the wild. By drawing on the lessons learnt in this case study I show that it is possible to establish a set of general guidelines for the future management of infectious diseases in threatened wildlife.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wildlife disease ecology</field><field name="subject">demography</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">disease management</field><field name="subject">Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease</field><field name="subject">capture-mark-recapture</field><field name="subject">multi-state models</field><field name="subject">life-history</field><field name="subject">selective culling</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dose individualisation of enoxaparin</field><field name="creator">Michael Barras</field><field name="description">Abstract The global aims of this thesis were: to evaluate if an individualised dose strategy for enoxaparin, based on lean body weight and renal function, resulted in a reduction in the prevalence of bleeding and bruising events when compared to conventional dosing; to further understand the dose-exposure-response relationship for enoxaparin using population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) modelling. This thesis comprises seven chapters: an introduction to the current knowledge and literature pertaining to low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), in particular enoxaparin; five research chapters; and a discussion. Each of the five research chapters consists of a manuscript that has been published in, accepted or submitted for peer review in a scientific journal. Preceding each chapter is a synopsis of the important features of the publication. Supplementary information that supports the findings of the publication, but could not be included in the publication, is provided at the end of the chapter. Appendices relevant to each chapter are located at the end of the thesis. Chapter one is the introduction to this thesis. It commences with an overview of the LMWHs, their mechanism of action, customary uses, licensed doses and adverse effects. There is a brief introduction to renal function and body composition; physiological factors that influence the disposition of LMWHs. As much of this thesis is centred on defining the dose-exposure-response relationship for enoxaparin, there is a critique of the existing literature relevant to each segment of this relationship, namely: dose-exposure, exposure-response and dose-response. To conclude this chapter there is a review of pharmacostatistical models and population modelling, followed by an appraisal of population PK and PKPD models that have previously been developed for enoxaparin, including the two key publications that are critical to this thesis. These two papers were the first to fully describe the dose-exposure relationship for enoxaparin in subjects with renal impairment and obesity. It is from these studies that the individualised dosing strategy, explored throughout this thesis, was developed. The specific aims of the five research chapters are then stated. Chapter two describes a confirmatory, randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare an individualised dose of enoxaparin to conventional, label based dosing. The RCT was conducted at a major tertiary teaching hospital over an 18 month period. The primary endpoint was the prevalence of overt bleeding events and the secondary endpoint a combination of bleeding or major bruising events. A time-to-bleeding event analysis (Kaplan-Meier) was used and markers of effectiveness such as mortality and readmission were assessed out to 30 days post recruitment. Bleeding and bruising data, along with anti-Xa (aXa)-concentrations were collected for use in additional research described in chapters four and five. Chapter three details the evolution, progression and contemporary knowledge of drug dosing based on body composition and focuses on dosing in obese subjects with cardiovascular disease. The concept of dose-individualisation is explored in this chapter with reference to the methods used to normalise drug exposure across the spectrum of body compositions. Subsequently, there is a review of body size descriptors, such as lean body weight, that are used to scale dosing in the obese. Enoxaparin is used as a motivating example, with reference to data presented in Chapter two of this thesis. There is also a discussion about the type of research designs that are required to maximise information about PK parameters. This chapter was published within a book chapter which was intended for clinical practitioners in the discipline of cardiology. Chapter four is focused on the development and evaluation of population PK and PKPD models to describe the time-course of effects for enoxaparin. A population PK model linked to a proportional-odds model was used to describe the severity of an adverse event as a function of exposure and demographic variables. The final model was used to explore the likely occurrence of bleeding and bruising events in patients with obesity and / or renal impairment dosed using either the individualised or conventional dose strategies from Chapter two. Chapter five describes a study that was undertaken to evaluate the ability of the individualised dosing strategy to achieve and maintain aXa-concentrations within the therapeutic range (500 to 1000 IU L-1), by comparison to conventional dosing. As the confirmatory study focused on the prevalence of adverse events there was no assessment of the therapeutic capability of the dose strategies however, as aXa-concentrations were collected using a sparse design during the confirmatory study, the two dose strategies could not be compared using observed data. Therefore, the population PK model developed in Chapter four was used to predict individual subject concentration-time profiles to 120 hours of enoxaparin therapy. The time spent in the therapeutic, supra-therapeutic and sub-therapeutic ranges was computed for each subject and the dosing strategies statistically compared. This study also allowed the evaluation of the results from Chapter two from a dose-exposure perspective. Chapter six of this thesis describes a survey. The aim of this survey was to gain an understanding of how dosing strategies of enoxaparin vary in four countries, investigate if clinicians are prescribing according to the Product label, and determine the methods used to dose-individualise enoxaparin. In doing so, individual hospitals in the international community will be able to compare, critique or benchmark their own strategies to peer hospitals, as well as the current literature. The publication arising from this survey would assist in the dissemination of knowledge gained from the earlier chapters of this thesis. Chapter seven is the final discussion and conclusions of the thesis along with prospects for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">enoxaparin</field><field name="subject">Low-molecular-weight heparins</field><field name="subject">bleeding</field><field name="subject">dose-individualisation</field><field name="subject">renal impairment</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">lean body weight</field><field name="subject">cardiology</field><field name="subject">population modelling</field><field name="subject">drug exposure</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195298</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new method for computing anharmonic rovibrational densities of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters at arbitrary angular momenta</field><field name="creator">Sarah Windsor</field><field name="description">A new methodology is developed to calculate density of states of interstellar and atmospheric clusters that takes account of their loosely bound nature and incorporates kinetically important angular momentum constraints explicitly. The method is based on classical phase space integration for the intermonomer modes of the cluster with imposition of the constraints of selected total energy and total angular momentum. It achieves considerable efficiency via essentially analytic evaluation of the momentum space integrals coupled with efficient Monte Carlo sampling of configurations. The derivation for the equation for the density of states is outlined and all steps in the simplification of the accessible momentum space volume are detailed. The method is tested rigorously against an entirely analytic result obtained for the ideal case of a dimer with spherical top fragments and no interaction potential. Interstellar applications of the new approach are presented for (HCN)2 and (CO)2. The new intermononmer density of states has been integrated over metastable states to obtain the intermonomer partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the metastable equilibrium constants for interstellar clusters, which in turn is used tocalculate the second order rate constant of overall dimer formation in the interstellar environment. Atmospheric applications of the new approach are presented for (H2O)2. The new intermonomer density of states is convoluted with the intramonomer density of states to obtain the convoluted density of states. This convoluted density of states is then integrated over total energy and angular momentum to obtain the anharmonic partition function, which in turn is used to calculate the equilibrium constant for atmospheric clusters, which in turn is used to calculate the third order rate constant for overall dimer formation in the atmospheric environment. Kinetic quantities are also calculated with the intermonomer and convoluted density of states for interstellar and atmospheric clusters, respectively. These densities of states are combined with RRKM theory to compute unimolecular dissociation rate constants, which are then averaged with respect to the thermal capture flux distribution to compute average lifetimes as a function of temperature.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interstellar, atmospheric, classical, density of states, metastable, partition function,</field><field name="subject">equilibrium constant, rate constant, lifetime</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY OF LEUCAENA (LEUCAENA LEUCOCEPHALA)-GRASS PASTURES IN QUEENSLAND</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Radrizzani Bonadeo</field><field name="description">Hedgerows of the fodder tree legume Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit ssp. glabrata (Rose Z&#225;rate) (leucaena) planted with companion grass (leucaena-grass pasture) form a productive, profitable and sustainable tropical pasture in northern Australia. Leucaena is renowned for its longevity (&gt;30 years) and productivity under regular grazing, and this is a key factor in its profitability. To-date graziers and researchers have not been concerned about the sustainability of commercial leucaena-grass pastures, which are rarely fertilized. However, nutrient depletion could be expected after many years of nutrient removal under heavy grazing without replenishment, even on soils of moderate initial fertility. This study investigated the long-term productivity of leucaena-grass pastures in relation to nutrient depletion in Queensland. Experimental trials were conducted at 3 research stations and 6 commercial cattle properties. Prior to conducting field trials, a postal survey of leucaena growers ascertained perceived changes in leucaena, grass and livestock productivity over time. Physical and management factors influencing long-term pasture productivity were also explored. Graziers reported that leucaena productivity had declined in 58% of aging pastures. Lower livestock productivity was associated with declining leucaena growth, even though grass growth remained vigorous. Leucaena growth decline was more frequent on soil types of marginal initial fertility. Maintenance fertilizer was not applied to most (98%) leucaena pastures surveyed despite significant amounts of nutrient removal, particularly phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S), occurring over prolonged periods of moderate to high grazing pressure. It was predicted that under current management practices large areas of commercial leucaena pasture will be affected by soil nutrient depletion over the next 10 years. The effect of age of leucaena plants on pasture productivity was investigated in pastures aged from 8 to 38 years. Leucaena growth, expressed as rainfall use efficiency (RUE), declined with age (from 4.0 to 1.9 kg total dry matter (DM)/ha/mm), as did leaf nitrogen (N), P and S concentrations. Leucaena productivity decline was attributed to P and S deficiency restricting growth and symbiotic dinitrogen (N2) fixation. Composition of interrow grass changed from native grass dominance before leucaena establishment to green panic (Panicum maximum var. trichoglume) dominance in the aging leucaena pastures, particularly adjacent to leucaena hedgerows. This was attributed to increased soil Navailability. Leucaena and grass roots were concentrated in the topsoil; however, leucaena roots did extend beyond 1 m depth while grass roots did not. Changes in topsoil organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (TN) resulting from the planting of leucaena hedgerows into native grass pastures and previously cropped soils were studied. Topsoil OC and TN contents increased significantly under leucaena pasture (OC from 81-290 kg/ha/year and TN from 12-24 kg/ha/yr). Since TN and OC showed similar trends, there was no significant effect on carbon:N ratios. Leucaena contributed to soil OC both directly via plant part decomposition, and indirectly, via enhanced grass growth in the inter-row. Lower topsoil OC accumulation rates (81 kg/ha/yr) were observed in the older leucaena-grass pastures related to the decline in yield and vigour of leucaena in these aging pastures. The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) accumulated in soil OC in productive leucaena-grass pasture was estimated to be higher than the amount of CO2-e emitted in methane from beef production from these pastures, thus positively impacting on their greenhouse gas balance. Leucaena responses to P and/or S applications were evaluated in a 30 year-old leucaenagrass pasture. Leucaena RUE and symbiotic N2 fixation were restricted by S deficiency. Sulfur concentration in leaf tissue and high N:S ratio were useful indicators of S deficiency. Although leucaena growth and its nutritional status were little affected by P application, symbiotic N2 fixation did respond significantly to P application. Leucaena and grass responses to fertiliser applications were further evaluated at a variety of soil types and environments on 8 sites in Queensland. Increased leucaena RUE (from 3.1 to 4.6 kg total DM/ha/mm) and enhanced nutritional status at most sites showed that leucaena plants were restricted by P and/or S deficiency. The major factors contributing to the P and S deficiencies were: a) inherent low soil P and/or S fertility, b) nutrient removal by cropping and grazing, c) shallow soils, d) acid soils, and e) grass competition for available water and nutrients. Inter-row cultivation (with or without fertiliser) had little effect on leucaena growth but significantly increased grass RUE (from 4.7 to 7.0 kg total DM/ha/mm) at some sites probably due to enhanced mineralization of N. Leaf P and S concentrations were not reliable indicators of deficiencies of these nutrients, possibly due to inadequate leaf sampling conditions. The effects of ambient temperature, water stress and phenological development of plant on nutrient concentrations in leucaena leaf was investigated to determine whether leaf tissueanalysis can reliably predict nutrient deficiencies. The youngest fully expanded leaf (YFEL) was established as the most appropriate leaf tissue for predicting nutritional status of leucaena plants since the YFEL: (a) was an easily identifiable tissue in which nutrient shifts were at a minimum; (b) provided information for readily mobile (N, P and potassium) and variably mobile (S, copper and zinc) nutrients, thus simplifying leaf collection; and (c) facilitated comparison of data from leaves of similar physiological age in different growing conditions and sites. Nutrient concentrations in YFEL were significantly influenced by water stress and phenological stage of plant development (particularly flowering and pod filling) through the mechanism of rate of leaf appearance. Chronological age of the YFEL, an indicator of leaf appearance, varied from 12 to &gt;70 days depending upon plant phenological stage, being &gt;140 days under prolonged water stress. It was found that nutrient concentrations in leucaena YFEL can only be interpreted against critical concentrations if plants are actively growing (October-April) in a vegetative stage and YFEL are &lt;20 days old. This will occur if there is no water stress for &#8805;28 days prior to sampling. A close correlation existed between chronological age of YFEL and leaf calcium (Ca) concentration. Calcium concentration could be used to assess the age of YFEL and thereby determine the suitability of tissue samples for nutrient analysis and interpretation. Leaves with Ca concentrations &gt;0.7% DM should be discarded as they are likely to be too old (&gt;20 days). The research program has identified that leucaena established on non-alluvial soils need to be provided with regular maintenance P and S fertiliser to promote symbiotic N2 fixation and to maintain high RUE. At present, many leucaena pastures are likely to be suffering undiagnosed nutrient deficiencies that will be limiting pasture and animal productivity and enterprise profitability. Youngest fully expanded leaf analysis can be used as a predictive tool to diagnose nutrient deficiencies provided the recommended protocol is followed. Further investigation is required to: a) assess the duration of responses to applied fertiliser to determine frequency of application; b) investigate the rate of maintenance fertiliser P and S that has to be applied to maintain leucaena symbiotic N2 fixation and RUE at a desired level to benefit both forage quality and quantity, and soil fertility; c) study methods of fertiliser placement for adequate and timely supply of nutrients, particularly P, to leucaena roots; and d) confirm the use of Ca concentration in YFEL as a predictor of optimum leaf age for the range of soils and areas where leucaena is grown.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tree legumes, sustainability, RUE, nitrogen fixation, nutrient depletion,</field><field name="subject">fertiliser, plant nutrition, plant analysis, nutrient concentration, leaf age.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A NOVEL AND COST-EFFECTIVE UNDERWATER WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE FOR SENSOR NETWORKS.</field><field name="creator">Umberto Cella</field><field name="description">abstract: This thesis presents a novel, thorough approach to the application of low frequency electromagnetic (EM) wave wireless communication in marine environment. This investigation is both theoretical and experimental, and is oriented towards marine sensor network applications. Different solutions within the underwater low frequency EM communication area are compared on the basis of their feasibility and practicality, especially in relation to scientific environmental monitoring applications. As a result, this thesis gathers a coordinated series of application oriented analyses of devices, such as antennas, transmitters, receivers, and of propagation issues, like signal attenuation and antenna positioning. The concluding step in this analysis is constituted by experimental field tests. As a final outcome, this works provides facts, guidelines and prototype designs related to the application of EM communication in shallow water environment, and demonstrates this communication technique is convenient for shallow water sensor networks implementation. The process followed in this analysis starts from practical considerations regarding the characteristics required by scientific equipment used in environmental monitoring. A case study is presented where a hybrid (partially wired) marine sensor network is deployed in Moreton Bay, Queensland. Strengths and weaknesses of this system are analysed, and, based on this experience, new requirements and constraints are set for a prospective improved fully wireless sensor network. In particular, the shallow water marine environment is recognized as the most likely target for scientific investigation because of its biological, economical and social importance. Firstly, various underwater communication techniques are analysed and compared. This is done on the basis of two factors: the first one is the final use of the sensor network, and the second one is the peculiar nature of the shallow water marine environment. From this analysis, it emerges that EM communication may be, in the shallow water environment, a viable and good alternative to acoustic- and optical-based techniques. From this point on, this work is aimed to prove this possibility. The next step undertaken is the theoretical analysis of EM propagation in the shallow water environment, which is modelled as a stratified lossy dielectric. The outcome of theoretical calculations is that, within a certain distance, and for a given transmitter power, low frequency EM waves are a communication channel exploitable by underwater wireless sensor networks. This is particularly true when the required data rate is low, as it is in the case of monitoring variables such as temperatures or concentrations of dissolved substances in the sea. Following this, the electric dipole and the loop antenna are studied and compared when immersed in a lossy medium such as seawater. In particular, the comparison is drawn in terms of antenna size, with absorbed power and radiated field level held equal. This, together with other practical considerations, allows the choice of the electric dipole &#8211; with some variations with respect to free space applications &#8211; as the preferred transmitting and receiving antenna. Theoretical results are verified and completed by simulations, and final prototype design guidelines are presented, together with best deployment practice suggestions. Finally, measurements are conducted in order to verify the previous calculations and considerations. In addition to them, a sensor network prototype that uses EM underwater communication is presented and tested. The field tests verify, in a real situation and at several frequencies, the maximum distance coverable with a 100 mW power source. Moreover, the same test is also conducted in fresh water, and results are compared. The instruments used for the measurements are thoroughly described, as it is the wireless sensor prototype presented. The main feature of this design is its simplicity, demonstrating that shallow water EM communication is easily achievable and that it meets the standards required by a local area marine sensor network. It can be concluded that this work offers a thorough theoretical analysis of EM propagation in shallow water environment: in parallel with this, a synthesis of practical issues that are encountered in the design of EM communication devices for underwater sensor networks is also presented. In particular, EM underwater propagation, antennas, transmitters and receiver circuits and deployment issues are thoroughly covered. Aspects such as the application of advanced signal modulations and communication protocols, however, are intentionally left open to further investigation. In fact, the range of research topics opened by this work is very wide, and they could not be all covered within this work: they span from energy harvesting to communication protocols, from antenna design to power management. All these areas are well covered by literature for terrestrial sensor networks, but they are not covered for underwater sensor networks that use EM communication: these latter are, in fact, a novelty by themselves. The problems related to this particular application have been, therefore, thoroughly exposed and opened to future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">underwater communication</field><field name="subject">electromagnetic</field><field name="subject">underwater sensor networks</field><field name="subject">experimental</field><field name="subject">environmental monitoring</field><field name="subject">prototype</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:195885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framing analysis of the British news media&#8217;s coverage of the Maldives during the tsunami: Towards a crisis communications model</field><field name="creator">Aminath Ahmed Shihab</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the diversity of print news media frames during different stages of a crisis to enhance a model of media crisis communication, based on a framing analysis of the British print news media&#8217;s coverage of the Maldives after the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of 2004. The tourism sector is vulnerable to disasters and crises with a series of recent events ranging from natural disasters and epidemics to terrorists attacks, many of which have had devastating impacts on the economy of destinations. In 2004, one such event of significance for the tourism industry was the 9.2 magnitude earthquake that hit the coast of northwest Sumatra, unleashing a tsunami that destroyed coastal areas in the Indian Ocean region including the Maldives. This disaster led to extensive media coverage, and has highlighted the importance of immediate and strategic communications after a crisis such as this tsunami. This research adopts the theory of framing and applies it during a tourism crisis situation. There is a lack of knowledge about the process of framing in crisis communications in the tourism literature, especially as it relates to the implications for planning and managing a tourism destination during and after a crisis situation. Previous literature on the framing by the media of tourism events and issues has focused on travel articles, advertising and promotion messages. This thesis finds that framing theory is also useful to identify how the news media responds during a crisis and how that knowledge could help improve tourism crisis management. This study analyzes the print news media regarding Maldives tourism in the aftermath of the tsunami crisis, and evaluates the diversity of frames used by the British news media in different stages of a crisis to enable the enhancement of a media crisis communications model in a tourism related context. This research is underpinned by constructivism with an interpretive orientation with the strategy of inquiry based on a qualitative case study method, and aims to understand aspects of the social and cultural contexts interrelating media and tourism. The framing analysis uses newspaper articles from the British press between December 26, 2004 and December 31, 2005 inclusive. The research uses content analysis of the news stories within a framing analysis paradigm, identifying both the diversity of frames used at different times after a disaster or crisis and the media phases that correspond to the last four stages of Faulkner&#8217;s (2001) tourism disaster management framework. The framing analysis reveals how the frames change during the different stages of the crisis and contributes to theory development in the areas of media effects, news discourse and crisis management as well as offering practical advice on tourism destination marketing during a crisis situation. The findings from this research contribute to the theory of framing by finding that during the coverage of crises where events are changing rapidly the media frames also change and different frames become predominant during the stages of a crisis. The findings also contribute to the literature on news discourse by providing evidence on the evolution of news discourse concerning a crisis situation over an extended period. By examining the news media crisis communication language as used at various stages of a crisis, the findings reveal that the media&#8217;s response and the frames they use differ over time as a crisis evolves, and that this enables the identification of different media roles during a crisis and crisis communication action stages. The result is a model that contributes to theoretical knowledge in media effects research, news discourse and crisis communications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crisis, crisis communications, framing, tourism management, tsunami, Maldives</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sino-Australian wool trade in the WTO era: socio-economic and transaction cost factors as determinants of vertical coordination</field><field name="creator">Benjamin Lyons</field><field name="description">The Sino-Australian wool trade relationship is the most significant in the international wool industry. China accounts for 65 per cent of Australia&#8217;s wool exports and Australian wool around 70 per cent of China&#8217;s imports. At the same time, it has also been one of the most contentious areas of Sino- Australian trade. There have been frequent disputes, protracted trade negotiations and numerous problems unsettling the smooth flow of product from Australian woolgrowers to Chinese wool textile mills. Despite a number of investigations and several bilateral and multilateral initiatives to improve trade protocols, in particular associated with China&#8217;s accession in the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, many of these longstanding problems remain unresolved. A range of different methods are employed by China-located early-stage wool processors (ESWPs) to obtain their raw wool requirements. This research applies transaction cost analysis to examine the extent to which different raw material purchasing channels have changed (and are changing) over time. The research aims both to elucidate how China-located ESWPs govern the wool procurement transaction and to investigate the interaction of socio-economic (asset specificity, frequency, uncertainty) and transactional cost factors (information, negotiation and monitoring costs) influencing the decision-making of the ESWPs. This research is unique in that it has been conducted by a wool industry &#8220;insider&#8221; who speaks Mandarin and who has applied the Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) from the perspective of the Chinese management of the ESWP firm in order to identify possible improvements. Transaction Cost Analysis seeks to analyse the &#8220;make or buy decision&#8221; or in this case the degrees of backwards vertical integration into the Australian wool marketing system by China&#8217;s ESWPs. The &#8220;make or buy&#8221; decision has become a theoretical reality since China&#8217;s WTO accession &#8212; an institutional change that allows more vertical coordination and the potential for improved fibre selection in Australia&#8217;s wool market. Understanding these structures can provide considerable insight into how the Australian wool supply chain (particularly fibre selection and soft attribute differentiation) can be improved to the benefit of stakeholders. This is especially important from the viewpoint of improving the quality of China&#8217;s intermediate wool processing &#8212; a vital stage where any mistakes in fibre selection cannot be undone and are expensive, often only &#8220;discovered&#8221; much later at garment or fabric delivery stage. Being a natural fibre destined for the high-end apparel market, quality with consistency is always a challenge for wool, &#8220;the fibre&#8221;, in the modern textile landscape. The research finds that although the conditions exist for vertical coordination, a hierarchy structure has v only been employed by foreign processors that had pre-existent raw material infrastructure in Australia. Most Australian wool imports still enter China through intermediaries without sufficient completeness of the contract, mainly owing to the uniquely &#8220;Chinese&#8221; method of price and quality risk management. Two large privately owned Chinese processors have vertically integrated for some of their raw material needs but also use intermediaries to avoid over dependency. The fact that China has still not completely fulfilled WTO entry requirements, specifically in regards to Tariff Rate Quota administration, also contributes to state intermediary participation and sovereign risk issues that periodically destabilise Australian wool markets. Institutional reforms have had little impact on wool quality, and significant improvements in terms of outcomes for both processors and woolgrowers would only be possible by further integration of Chinese processors into Australia&#8217;s wool marketing system.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transaction cost economics, vertical coordination, China, international trade</field><field name="subject">Wool industry - China</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamical analysis of respiratory signals for diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing disorders.</field><field name="creator">Suren Rathnayake</field><field name="description">Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a highly prevalent but an under-diagnosed disease. Among adults in the ages between 30 to 60 years, 24% of males and 9% of females show conditions of SDB, while 82% of men and 93% of women with moderate to severe SDB remain undiagnosed. Polysomnography (PSG) is the reference diagnostic test for SDB. During PSG, a number of physiological signals are recorded during an overnight sleep and then manually scored for sleep/wake stages and SDB events to obtain the reference diagnosis. The manual scoring of SDB events is an extremely time consuming and cumbersome task with high inter- and intra-rater variations. PSG is a labour intensive, expensive and patient inconvenient test. Further, PSG facilities are limited leading to long waiting lists. There is an enormous clinical need for automation of PSG scoring and an alternative automated ambulatory method suitable for screening the population. During the work of this thesis, we focus (1) on implementing a framework that enables more reliable scoring of SDB events which also lowers manual scoring time, and (2) implementing a reliable automated screening procedure that can be used as a patient-friendly home based study. The recordings of physiological measurements obtained during patients&#8217; sleep of- ten suffer from data losses, interferences and artefacts. In a typical sleep scoring session, artifact-corrupted signal segments are visually detected and removed from further consideration. We developed a novel framework for automated artifact detection and signal restoration, based on the redundancy among respiratory flow signals. The signals focused on are the airflow (thermistor sensors) and nasal pressure signals that are clinically significant in detecting respira- tory disturbances. We treat the respiratory system as a dynamical system, and use the celebrated Takens embedding theorem as the theoretical basis for sig- nal prediction. In this study, we categorise commonly occurring artefacts and distortions in the airflow and nasal pressure measurements into several groups and explore the efficacy of the proposed technique in detecting/recovering them. Results we obtained from a database of clinical PSG signals indicated that theproposed technique can detect artefacts/distortions with a sensitivity &gt;88% and specificity &gt;92%. This work has the potential to simplify the work done by sleep scoring technicians, and also to improve automated sleep scoring methods. During the next phase of the thesis we have investigated the diagnostic ability of single &#8211; and dual&#8211;channel respiratory flow measuring devices. Recent studies have shown that single channel respiratory flow measurements can be used for automated diagnosis/screening for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) diseases. Improvements for reliable home-based monitoring for SDB may be achieved with the use of predictors based on recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RQA essentially measures the complex structures present in a time series and are relatively independent of the nonlinearities present in the respiratory measurements such as those due to breathing nonlinearities and sensor movements. The nasal pressure, thermistor-based airflow, abdominal movement and thoracic movement measurements obtained during Polysomnography, were used in this study to implement an algorithm for automated screening for SDB diseases. The algorithm predicts SDB-affected measurement segments using twelve features based on RQA, body mass index (BMI) and neck circumference using mixture discriminant analysis (MDA). The rate of SDB affected segments of data per hour of recording (RDIS) is used as a measure for the diagnosis of SDB diseases. The operating points to be chosen were the prior probability of SDB affected data segments (&#960;1) and the RDIS threshold value, above which a patient is predicted to have a SDB disease. Cross-validation with five-folds, stratified based on the RDI values of the recordings, was used in estimating the operating points. Sensitivity and specificity rates for the final classifier were estimated using a two-layer assessment approach with the operating points chosen at the inner layer using five-fold cross-validation and the choice assessed at the outer layer using repeated learning-testing. The nasal pressure measurement showed higher accuracy compared to other respiratory measurements when used alone. The nasal pressure and thoracic movement measurements were identified as the best pair of measurements to be used in a dual channel device. The estimated sensitivity and specificity (standard error) in diagnosing SDB disease (RDI &#8805; 15) are 90.3(3.1)% and 88.3(5.5)% when nasal pressure is used alone and together with the thoracic movement it was 89.5(3.7)% and 100.0(0.0)%. Present results suggest that RQA of a single respiratory measurement has potential to be used in an automated SDB screening device, while with dual-channel more reliable accuracy can be expected. Improvements may be possible by including other RQA based features and optimisation of the parameters.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear signal analysis</field><field name="subject">dynamic systems modelling</field><field name="subject">sleep disordered breathing</field><field name="subject">neural networks</field><field name="subject">recurrence quantification analysis</field><field name="subject">mixture discriminant analysis</field><field name="subject">cross-validation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196231</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation on motoneurone input-output properties with increasing voluntary drive in the human triceps surae</field><field name="creator">Tomomichi Oya</field><field name="description">The series of experiments comprising this thesis investigate how neural inputs arising from higher motor centres (e.g., the motor cortex) and the periphery are translated into a variety of activation patterns of alpha motoneurones during the performance of various muscle contraction types. The thesis consists of six chapters, with the first chapter providing an introduction to the research program, and the final chapter giving a summary of the main research findings. Chapter 2 to 5 each represent stand-alone scientific works. The study presented in Chapter 2 examined whether the soleus (SOL) H-reflex is modulated during shortening contractions in a manner that has been observed for isometric contractions. It was revealed that no significant correlation was found between the SOL H-reflex and increasing plantar flexion torque during shortening contractions (&#961; = &#8722;0.07, P = 0.15), while a strong positive correlation was observed for the isometric conditions (&#961; = 0.99, P &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, no modulation in the H-reflexes via paired stimuli in voluntary shortening contractions suggested that the level of homosynaptic post-activation depression (HPAD) did not change in response to the varying levels of activation in voluntary shortening contractions. Therefore, Ia-excitatory input is likely to be reduced during shortening contractions at increasing intensities, possibly due to a centrally regulated increase in presynaptic inhibition. The study described in Chapter 3 investigated corticospinal-evoked responses in triceps surae muscles during voluntary contractions at varying strengths. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) were elicited in the SOL and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles using magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex and cervicomedullary junction during voluntary plantar flexions with the torque ranging from 0 to 100% of a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). In both SOL and MG, MEP and CMEP amplitudes [normalized to maximal M wave (Mmax)] showed an increase, followed by a plateau, over the greater part of the contraction range with responses increasing from 0.2 to 6% of Mmax for SOL and from 0.3 to 10% of Mmax for MG. It was suggested that increases in the evoked responses from the triceps surae muscle over a greater range of contraction strengths than for upper limb muscles, probably stems from differences in the pattern of motor unit recruitment and rate coding for these muscles, and the strength of the corticospinal input. In Chapter 4, in an attempt to investigate how the recruitment and rate coding of motor unit organisation can affect the responsiveness of gross evoked potentials to artificial excitatory stimuli, a computer simulation was performed based upon a physiologically plausible model of the motoneurone. The simulation revealed that the force level where the evoked response commences to decline corresponds approximately to the upper limit of recruitment of motor units. This observation was consistent no matter whether firing rates for low-threshold units exceed those for high-threshold units. Since the simulated results were consistent with previous observations in both individual (single motor unit) and population (motoneurone pool) terms, the proposed model is physiologically plausible and can be useful to predict the evoked EMG response via artificial stimulation protocols, thereby inferring the underlying neural mechanisms occurring at the motoneurone pool during voluntary movements. The study presented in Chapter 5 determined the recruitment range and discharge behaviours in the SOL motor units, and examined the possible influence of persistent inward currents (PICs) on SOL motor unit recruitment and discharge rates. Forty-two clearly identified motor units from five subjects revealed that soleus motor units are recruited progressively from rest to contraction strengths close to 95% of MVC, with low-threshold motor units discharging action potentials slower at their recruitment and with a lower peak rate than later recruited high-threshold units. This observation is in contrast to the &#8216;onion skin phenomenon&#8217; often reported for the upper limb muscles. Based on positive correlations of the peak discharge rates, initial rates and recruitment order of the units with the magnitude of the onset-offset hysteresis (i.e., a difference in discharge rate between recruitment and de-recruitment) and not PIC contribution, we conclude that discharge behaviours among motor units appear to be related to a variation in an intrinsic property other than PICs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">motoneurone pool</field><field name="subject">motor unit</field><field name="subject">Ia-pathway</field><field name="subject">corticospinal tract</field><field name="subject">plantar flexion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depletion of Dendritic Cells to Prevent Acute Graft Versus Host Disease.</field><field name="creator">John Wilson</field><field name="description">Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) affects more than 40% of patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. aGVHD occurs after transplantation of donor haematopoietic cells into hosts incapable of rejecting the donor cells, when donor T cells attack host tissue. Despite extensive efforts, aGVHD remains problematic to prevent and difficult to control. Current therapies to prevent aGVHD induce profound immunosuppression, leaving patients at increased risk of infection and leukaemic relapse. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen presenting cells of haematopoietic origin and are the primary stimulators of the immune system, uniquely being able to activate na&#239;ve T cells. A growing body of evidence suggests that DC are responsible for the stimulation of the donor T cells which cause aGVHD. I have used a model of aGVHD which utilizes conditioned severe combined immunodeficient mice transplanted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In this model human CD4+ T cells appear to be responsible for an aGVHD-like syndrome which results in death 15-30 days post transplant. I have shown, using in vitro depletion of individual populations, that other subpopulations of human PBMC did not affect the survival of the mice. I have also demonstrated that human DC are required for the induction of aGVHD in the majority of mice. This novel finding validated the use of this model to test the primary hypothesis; that antibody mediated depletion of DC would prevent aGVHD. The murine IgM monoclonal antibody (Mab), CMRF-44 Mab, is specific for an unknown molecule expressed on the surface of activated human DC. Previous work had shown that when mixed lymphocyte reaction stimulator cells were depleted of CMRF-44+ cells, there was a significant reduction in the proliferation of responder cells. Here I tested the efficacy of CMRF-44 as a therapy for the prevention of aGVHD in the model. CMRF-44 Mab did not improve survival of mice treated with human PBMC, despite recent data showing that CMRF-44 expression on DC was predictive of aGVHD in patients. In vitro depletion of CMRF-44+ cells from human PBMC prior to transplantation also did not reduce incidence of aGVHD. An alternate target for the depletion of human DC was CD83 which is also expressed on the surface of activated human DC. I generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody using a human CD83 fusion protein, which was then affinity purified in a multi-step process which yielded only antibody specific for human CD83. Treatment with this antibody greatly improved survival of transplanted mice. Further experiments showed that anti-CD83 treatment did not abrogate human leucocytes including CD8+ memory T cells suggesting that a therapy using an anti-CD83 antibody has the potential to prevent aGVHD without the immunosuppression associated with current anti-aGVHD therapies. The work described here has validated the use of a human mouse chimeric model as an in vivo assay of human DC function and shown that targeting CD83 has the potential to reduce the incidence of clinical aGVHD whilst preserving donor memory T cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graft versus host disease</field><field name="subject">Immunosuppression</field><field name="subject">Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cell</field><field name="subject">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF HOT STABILISED NEURAL NETWORK VEHICLE EMISSION MODELS USING AUSTRALIAN DRIVING CYCLE DATA</field><field name="creator">Noppakun Boongrapue</field><field name="description">Evaluation of the environmental impacts of Intelligent Transport Systems and transport infrastructure management schemes relies heavily on the development of accurate and reliable environmental emissions models. Existing state-of-the-art models estimate pollutants based on a typical urban driving cycle using an aggregate modelling approach where a 'characteristic' vehicle is used to represent dissimilar vehicle populations. While this approach has been accepted by transport planners for strategic level studies, it can be argued that modelling individual vehicle emissions based on vehicle dynamics would result in more reliable evaluations of operational-level project impacts. The primary objective of this thesis is to develop vehicle emissions and fuel consumption models under hot stabilised settings and various traffic conditions using Australian fleet data collected from laboratory tests. The models use second-by-second vehicle real-time data to predict fuel consumption (FC) and pollutant emissions (HC, CO, NOx) at different levels of speed, acceleration, air-to-fuel ratio and torque. The data required for model development, calibration and validation was collated from laboratory tests conducted by the Second National In-Service Emissions (NISE 2) project. A total of 27 vehicles (including small, medium and large passenger vehicles; four-wheel drive (small and large); and light commercial vehicles were used in model development. The laboratory data, which comprised more than 48,500 second-by-second observations, was then pre-processed and randomly assigned to calibration and validation data sets for model development. The thesis then adopted a rigorous approach to develop and evaluate a large number of neural network architectures to determine the most suitable modelling framework. First, a pilot test was conducted to test different model development scenarios and establish some guidelines on the general framework for model development. The results were used to determine some of the crucial neural network parameters (eg learning rule or optimisation technique and most appropriate architecture) for use in subsequent modelling. Selected models were then further refined using test data from individual and aggregate vehicle types. This resulted in further refinement of modelling inputs where, for example, sensitivity analysis showed that speed and acceleration were the two most crucial inputs and that including other input parameters did not improve the accuracy of the results. The performance of selected neural network models was then compared to a number of sophisticated and complex statistical techniques based on multiple and non-linear regression models. The results generally showed that ANN models are effective and suitable for modelling emissions and that they perform as well or even better than the complex regression models tested in this study. Another general finding across all vehicles and for all models (neural and statistical) is that predictions are more accurate for fuel consumption and CO emissions than for other vehicular emissions. The models were also found to under-predict the emissions values at the peaks of graphs, but were generally consistent in their outputs across all other driving conditions. In this study, it was also found that one of the main advantages of the neural network approach over regression is the ease of developing one model to accurately predict multiple outputs. This is in contrast to the regression modelling approach, where it was found that accurate results matching neural network performance can only be achieved using one distinct model for predicting each output. This would clearly undermine the statistical approach because a large number of models would then need to be developed for a road network where second-by-second data is available for hundreds of vehicle types. Hence, the benefits of using neural networks immediately become clear and more appealing. This thesis also identified a number of issues for future research directions. To increase the accuracy and overall quality of the models, future research needs to include further classifications of vehicle types and other pertinent variables such as manufacture year, odometer reading and making use of a larger sample of modern vehicles representing current vehicle fleet compositions. There is also scope to improve the testing procedures by including road grade and air condition use, which are important factors that impact on vehicle performance and emissions. Future research can also benefit from testing other drive cycles and cross validation of models across different driving cycles. Model performance can also be enhanced by collecting instantaneous data using instrumented vehicles where emissions can be collected under real-life conditions rather than from controlled laboratory environments. Finally, the real benefit from development of these models is the ability to interface them to micro-simulation models where instantaneous speed and acceleration data can be provided to the emissions model on a second-by-second basis. The neural network emissions model would then be used to evaluate the impacts of ITS and other traffic management strategies with the aim of identifying the best environment-friendly traffic management approaches. This thesis has successfully achieved its objectives by demonstrating the feasibility of using neural networks for modelling vehicle emissions. The thesis further demonstrated the superior quality and advantages of the neural network approach over the more established statistical regression methods. Finally, the models developed in this study will allow researcher and practitioners alike to develop a better understanding and appreciation of the environmental impacts resulting from transport schemes aimed at reducing traffic congestion and enhancing environmental quality.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emission Modelling</field><field name="subject">Fuel Consumption Modelling</field><field name="subject">Neural Network</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance Practice Issues in Albinoni&#8217;s Concerto &#224; cinque, Op. 9 No. 5</field><field name="creator">Yuen Yee Amy Mak</field><field name="description">This critical commentary investigates performance practice issues in Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni&#8217;s Concerto &#224; cinque, op. 9 no. 5 (Amsterdam: Le C&#232;ne, 1722). It aims to stimulate players of the modern oboe to consider an historically informed approach towards the performance of this work through an assessment of relevant literature. Albinoni&#8217;s (1671&#8211;1750/51) professional career and the musical environment of Venice at this time form the backdrop for the study. The insularity of Albinoni&#8217;s life in Venice can be seen to have shaped certain original elements of his work. Furthermore, the increased availability of woodwind virtuosos in northern Italy during the early eighteenth century saw the composition of concertos for the oboe become an established part of Venetian musical life. This critical commentary includes a review of both historical treatises and modern literature that focus on the major performance practice parameters of tempo, dynamics, articulation and ornamentation. The historical treatises provide oboists with an understanding of the general practice during the baroque period, while the modern literature offers further discussion and analysis of these sources, alongside newer ideas for approaching the performance of Albinoni&#8217;s concerto. The resulting suggestions should not be regarded as rigid rules that contemporary performers must follow, but rather aim to give them more insight into the possible interpretation of the work. Thus the study provides both background information on the Concerto and guidelines on performance practice to assist oboists in generating their own ideas so that they can then develop their own interpretation of Albinoni&#8217;s concerto based on the evidence obtained from extensive research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1904 Performing Arts and Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni</field><field name="subject">Oboe Concerto Op. 9 No. 5</field><field name="subject">Historical Performance Practice</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a novel air pollution monitoring strategy combining passive sampling with toxicity testing</field><field name="creator">Karen Kennedy</field><field name="description">The presence of complex mixtures of compounds in ambient air, many of which are either unknown or uncharacterised makes an assessment of risk associated with these exposures problematic. Bioanalytical methods can provide an integrative assessment of complex mixture potency for specific mechanisms of toxicity within these contexts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of monitoring ambient air exposures as sampled by (polyurethane foam) PUF passive air samplers (PAS) using effect based techniques (bioanalytical methods). Passive samplers have the advantage of offering a low-tech inexpensive monitoring strategy which can thereby increase sampling capacity across a broader range of scenarios simultaneously. One challenge posed by the application of passive samplers in particular for these assessments has been the expression of potency estimates in relatively non-comparable terms specific to a given dose of the sampler or for a specific deployment period. The project was therefore designed in order to address these aims and previously identified challenges by investigating the applicability of these techniques for: monitoring in both indoor and outdoor air, the determination of seasonal exposure gradients; the determination of exposure gradients in different locations (urban capitals, regional centres, background); and the application of in-situ calibration to provide comparable effect measurements in terms of equivalent reference compound air concentrations. Air sampled using PUF PAS was monitored for its capacity to induce biological responses which are mechanistically relevant to critical health endpoints in these scenarios. The mechanisms assessed included genotoxicity (DNA damage &#8211; umuC assay), Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity (CAFLUX assay), and estrogenicity (ESCREEN assay). The findings from this effect based monitoring revealed that the level of biological response measured changes with the exposure scenario (indoor vs. outdoor; summer vs. winter; urban capital cities vs. background locations). Estrogenicity for example assessed as estradiol equivalent air concentrations (E Eq BIO) averaged 54 pg.m-3 (1.5 - 185 pg.m-3) in indoor air, while samples from ambient air were found to be not estrogenic. Total aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activity assessed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin equivalent air concentrations (TCDD Eq BIO) averaged 4.1 pg.m-3 (1.3 &#8211; 7.2 pg.m-3) in indoor air while samples from ambient air averaged 15 pg.m-3 (1.5 &#8211; 46 pg.m-3)in summer and 53 pg.m-3 (2.2 &#8211; 251 pg.m-3) in winter. The relationship for both direct (-S9) and indirect (+S9) acting genotoxicity and AhR activity were found to be relatively consistent with respect to both season (elevated in winter) and location (elevated in urban capital cities). Overall suitable techniques were developed for combining passive sampling with multiple end-point toxicity testing and it was demonstrated that these techniques may be applied across different exposure scenarios. During the course of this method development and interpretation process a range of limitations were identified relating to: the use and application of effect based techniques to monitor environmental samples; the use of passive samplers within this context specifically; and also with the application of in-situ calibration techniques to passive samplers to improve the comparability of these assessments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">passive air sampling</field><field name="subject">toxicity testing</field><field name="subject">bioassays</field><field name="subject">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</field><field name="subject">semivolatile organic chemicals</field><field name="subject">air pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Work domain analysis and hydro power controller information needs</field><field name="creator">Bright, Lisa</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">0806 Information Systems</field><field name="subject">Information management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Experimental Investigation of Inlet Fuel Injection in a Three-Dimensional Scramjet Engine</field><field name="creator">James Turner</field><field name="description">Inlet-injection was motivated by the possibility for skin-friction reduction in the combustion chamber of a flight style, three-dimensional, scramjet engine. High Mach number flight, where skin friction in the combustion chamber is a significant proportion of the overall drag, is the regime of interest for this type of reduction. This is a result of high Mach number supersonic flow within the combustion chamber, coupled with high densities due to the compression process. The flight condition of interest was chosen to be Mach 8.0 at an altitude of 30km. This choice was dictated by near-term flight-testing capabilities. The approach was to design an inlet with a reduced contraction ratio. This would produce a relatively low-density combustion-chamber flow, that would, in turn, lead to lower viscous drag. Due to low temperatures in the combustion chamber, as a result of the reduced compression, a novel method of ignition was required. This fluid-dynamic ignition technique made use of inlet injection together with flow non-uniformities generated by the inlet. The inlet chosen for this purpose was a rectangular-to-elliptical-shape-transition inlet or REST inlet. The focus of the investigation, was therefore, to determine the potential for performance improvement using inlet injection of fuel. The general approach to the investigation was experimental, using a scramjet model consisting of inlet, combustion chamber and a truncated nozzle. Flow-path thrust-potential was used as the primary performance parameter, where the term `thrust-potential' is used to indicate the lack of full expansion. A secondary performance metric was combustion efficiency, determined by matching one-dimensional analysis to experimental pressure distributions. In addition to inlet-injection, conventional injection into the combustion-chamber was tested as the performance baseline. Based on findings from these tests, two additional methods of injection were investigated both having a combination of inlet and combustion-chamber injection. The general findings showed that inlet injection, in comparison to combustion-chamber injection, produced an increase in performance in terms of thrust-potential and combustion efficiency for supersonic combustion. This occurred over a range of equivalence ratios up to 1.0. However, the maximum thrust developed by inlet injection was limited by engine unstart. In terms of the maximum thrust-potential, combustion-chamber injection exceeded that of inlet injection but significantly higher fuelling was required and poor combustion efficiency persisted. In order to offset the limit in thrust production due to unstart, an alternative fuelling method was implemented. This took the form of partial injection of the fuel in the combustion chamber in combination with inlet injection. An increase in thrust-potential and combustion efficiency as a result of increased fuel coverage in areas of the combustion chamber, which were fuel lean under inlet-injection. A thrust potential level similar to that of combustion-chamber injection was achieved with significantly higher combustion efficiency and consequently a lower fuelling level. This type of combined-injection is an attractive option for fuel delivery at the nominal flight condition. An additional finding for combustion-chamber and combined injection was that very high equivalence ratios led to separated flow in the combustion chamber and isolator. This was a result of excessive heat release producing an adverse pressure gradient in the engine. This mode of operation showed high levels of thrust-potential at equivalence ratios in excess of 1.0. Although interesting, these findings were outside the scope of the investigation since the flow within the combustion chamber is no longer purely supersonic.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scramjet, hypersonic, experimental, supersonic combustion, inlet-injection, skin-friction</field><field name="subject">radical-farming, ignition, three-dimensional inlet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Islamic Publication Industry in Modern Indonesia: Intellectual Transmission, Ideology, and the Profit Motive</field><field name="creator">Akh Muzakki</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of the relationship between the intellectual transmission of Islam, the cultivation of Islamic ideology, and the accumulation of profit within the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia. In order to investigate the relationship between these three aspects, this study concentrates on print media, with a particular focus on printed books and magazines. It is engaged with the central problem of how this Islamic industry posits itself in dealing with its role in transmitting Islamic teachings as well as developing certain kinds of Islamic ideology and in dealing with its capacity as an economic and business activity which is theoretically oriented to profit-making. The Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia has become an increasingly important area of interest. A number of scholarly works have appeared which allow us to understand better some of the features of the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia. A gap still remains, however, due to the fact that these studies have had only one focus of analysis, the ideological inclinations of different sections of the print media. As a result, fundamental problems remain, especially in connection to an examination of any relationship between the three issues indicated earlier. This thesis is an attempt to fill this gap in understanding the revival of the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia. It incorporates two foci of analysis, that is, an ideological and political economy approach, to uncover the material and non-material dimensions of the Islamic publication industry emerging in modern Indonesia. This study finds that the Islamic publication industry in modern Indonesia performs well through its high sales and significant contribution to the development of varied Islamic ideologies, and plays a unique role in the print publication industry in general. This industry posits itself not only as a profitable business enterprise but also as a significant da`wah (religious proselytising) unit. This mode of positing affects the way the industry deals with three key aspects of its publishing activities noted earlier. The study further demonstrates that the actualisation of these dual purposes occurs through the process of the so-called commodification of Islamic ideas and expressions within the print publication industry. The commodification of Islam itself refers, in fact, to a commercialisation which involves transforming Islamic faith, ideas, expressions and symbols into a real, exchanged commodity available for production, consumption or sale for profit. So, the Islamic print publication industry presents a commodified form of Islam in which Islamic teachings and the cultivation of Islamic ideologies become a real, exchanged commodity for profit collection. In transforming the concept of da`wah into the publication industry, Islamic publishers differ from one another, however. This difference can be seen through the diverse ways in which Islam and Muslim practices have been commodified as the major saleable commodity for publication. Likewise, all Islamic publishers have commodified different aspects of Islam and Muslim practices as the main materials for their own publication. People are presented, as a result, with different ideologies of Islam, from tolerant and progressive to fundamentalist-jihadist bents. This phenomenon develops similarly in both Islamic books and magazines. When there is contradiction particularly between the ideology and the market (profit), however, Islamic publishers develop a so-called &#8220;negotiated market&#8221;. This conception refers to the notion that Islamic publishing houses are certainly oriented to the market but at the same time they have to negotiate it with their ideology. For them, the market is so important that the decision to publish manuscripts has to consider it. The market is not everything for them, however, as it has to be decided whether the material in question contributes or discourages the development of the variety of Islamic ideology each of those Islamic publishers adopt. Attempts to understand better the Islamic publication industry with the increasing production and consumption of its products, books or magazines, in modern Indonesia need, therefore, an enriched theoretical perspective. This study shows us that a combined theoretical framework invoking both ideological and political economy aspects is useful in developing such an enriched theoretical perspective to address the interplay between these three aspects.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic publication industry, modern Indonesia, Islamic ideology, da`wah, commodification, book, magazine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancing Sustainability in Tourism Destinations with a Complex Adaptive Systems Approach Based on Systems Dynamics Modelling</field><field name="creator">Karin Schianetz</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the potential of a complex adaptive systems (CASs) approach based on system dynamics modelling (SDM) to add value to the currently used assessment tools and monitoring practices for tourism sustainability in an effort to advance sustainable development in tourism destinations. While many different concepts and tools for the assessment of sustainability have developed, most of them do not take the complexity and dynamics of tourism destinations into account. It is argued in this thesis that these linear tools need to be complemented with new approaches that can deal with uncertainty, non-linearity and unexpected changes. New knowledge from ecosystem research, which is derived from complex systems theory, suggests that tourism destinations are indeed social-ecological systems, which need to be viewed and studied as CASs. In recent years tourism researchers have acknowledged the necessity to view tourism as a system with interconnected elements, and have discussed the unpredictability of these tourism systems. CASs approaches, which have been successfully applied by ecologists and economists in other areas, are indicated for tourism management, but have been rarely used in order to promote sustainable tourism development and planning. Appropriate methodologies and frameworks for the implementation of CASs approaches into the tourism context are still lacking. Therefore this thesis addresses the aforementioned challenges as follows: &#8226; A critical review of the concepts and tools currently used for the advancement and assessment of sustainability in tourism destinations is presented. The review evaluates the suitability of assessment tools for specific sites and situations, and develops guidelines for tool selection. It is concluded that for particular purposes linear assessment tools need to be combined or complemented with tools that can deal with complexity and dynamics. Tools covered include sustainability indicators, environmental impact assessment, life cycle assessment, environmental audits, ecological footprints, multi-criteria analysis and adaptive environmental assessment. &#8226; The use of sustainability indicator as one of the most promoted assessment tools for sustainable development in tourism destination is explored further. A systemic indicator system (SIS) methodology based on a CASs approach as an alternative to linear assessments is developed. This methodology is tested using a case study of a holiday eco-village near Lamington National Park in Queensland. The research findings suggest that the SIS has the potential to enhance system understanding and adaptive management of tourism destinations, and can foster collective learning processes amongst stakeholders. &#8226; A framework is developed for a Learning Tourism Destination (LTD) based on the concept of the Learning Organisation, and using SDM as a tool for strategic planning and the promotion of organisational learning. The concept of the LTD is discussed on the basis of 6 case studies, where SDM has been applied primarily for predictive reasons, and through evaluation of the potential of SDM as a tool for the implementation and enhancement of collective learning processes. The results reveal that SDM is capable of promoting communication between stakeholders and stimulating organisational learning. It is argued that the effectiveness of SDM may be greatly increased through incorporation in the foundation of an LTD. &#8226; A practical approach for the implementation of an LTD is presented. Preliminary results from a case study undertaken at the Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia are discussed. Surveys were conducted to verify if the LTD forms a useful framework for fostering consensus building, dialogue and collective learning processes amongst stakeholders. The preliminary results of the study suggest that the implementation of an LTD on the Ningaloo Coast will improve the capacity of the local industry to take more responsibility for the sustainable development, and thus has the potential to enable a more effective transition to sustainability in the region. Through its multi-methodological approach, this thesis demonstrates the importance of considering tourism destinations as CASs. New concepts and assessment tools for sustainable tourism are needed that acknowledge the complex and dynamic nature of tourism and tourism development. Together, the SIS methodology and the LTD framework provide an initial platform from which to conduct further research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">09 Engineering</field><field name="subject">complex adaptive systems</field><field name="subject">Organisational Learning</field><field name="subject">Sustainability Assessment</field><field name="subject">sustainability indicators</field><field name="subject">System Dynamics Modelling</field><field name="subject">Tourism destinations</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of the effectiveness of differing levels of extension assistance in improving the adoption and management of small-scale forestry in Leyte Island, the Philippines</field><field name="creator">John Baynes</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of an agroforestry extension program to smallholder farmers on Leyte Island, the Philippines. The imperative for reforestation is well recognised in the Philippines and was the impetus for this program which provided farmers with assistance to establish and silviculturally manage timber trees on their land. Because the cost-effectiveness of agroforestry extension is increased if farmers develop self-efficacy without extensive training, the extension program was offered in two regimes to test the necessity for extended assistance. In the extended assistance regime, farmers were offered on-site assistance to collect seed, grow seedlings, prepare sites and establish trees, whereas in the limited assistance regime, farmers were only offered assistance to collect seed and grow seedlings. Descriptive statistics were collected of farmers&#8217; acceptance of technology and the manner in which technology was adapted to suit their personal circumstances. Translated conversations between farmers and extension staff also provided a rich source of data which provided insights into farmers&#8217; motivation. Extension activities were reviewed at a mid-program workshop, a final on-site inspection and an end-of-program workshop. Farmers responded positively to the extended assistance program which helped them to grow and out-plant seedlings. The limited assistance program was relatively unsuccessful. Overall, the extension program was successful in shifting the initiative for further planting from extension staff to participating farmers. However, farmers showed little interest in applying silvicultural thinning or pruning to existing plantations of trees because extension advice was not congruent with their existing mental models of these procedures. Systems modelling of socio-economic variables which had been found to affect program outcomes was used to predict critical success factors. A key constraint to program recruitment was found to be farmers&#8217; perception of harvest security, even when their needs for technology and planting materials are met. Modelling also cast doubt on the usefulness of written extension materials and emphasised the necessity for extended face-to-face technical assistance. Although conducted in Leyte, the findings of this research provide guidance for issues which affect the adoption of agroforestry both in the Philippines and in other countries. The research found that it was possible to recruit and motivate farmers without providing material incentives. If farmers experienced unexpected problems, providing extended face-to-face contact and assistance was critical if catastrophic losses of participating farmers were to be avoided. The failure of attempts to introduce advanced-age silviculture also indicated a need to elicit farmers&#8217; mental models as a precursor or parallel enquiry to extension activities. In a situation where little was initially known about farmers&#8217; understanding of agroforestry technology or the variables which affect their acceptance or rejection of extension assistance, the results of this research have shown that it is possible to build the capacity of farmers to establish timber trees. This result is in contrast to the acknowledged failure of the logging concession system in the Philippines and the difficulties faced by some industrial plantations and community-based programs. This investigation has shown that an opportunity exists to lift the level of tree planting in Leyte, provided that system variables which are either critical success factors or impediments are addressed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences</field><field name="subject">extension program</field><field name="subject">expert group</field><field name="subject">self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">small-scale nursery</field><field name="subject">Swietenia macrophylla</field><field name="subject">mental model</field><field name="subject">silviculture</field><field name="subject">systems modelling</field><field name="subject">Bayesian belief network</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Randomized comparison of efficacy, adherence, and acceptability of three multiple micronutrient supplements in Iranian infants</field><field name="creator">Kourosh Samadpour</field><field name="description">Introduction The last national micronutrient survey of Iran showed that, in spite of a national supplementation program, the prevalence of anaemia, and zinc deficiency were 37.8% and 20% among 15-23 months old infants, respectively. Data show that more than 60% of infants do not consume supplements regular. Moreover, the current supplementation program does not provide a zinc supplement. Home fortification has been promoted as an alternative approach, where families are able to add micronutrients to home-made food for infants. The majority of efficacy trials of multiple micronutrient containing &#8216;Sprinkles&#8217; powder and crushable &#8216;Foodlets&#8217; tablets have been conducted in areas where maize-based complementary food is common. The potential effects of home fortification supplement in Iran are uncertain as the staple food is different (wheat and rice vs. maize in other trials) and acceptability of the Sprinkles and Foodlets is unknown. This thesis aim to assess efficacy, adherence, and acceptability of Sprinkles and Foodlets as compared with current supplement (Drops) on micronutrient status (iron, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin D) and growth in Iranian infants aged 6-18 month. Methods A total of 405 infants were recruited from Hashtgerd, 80 km west of Tehran, Iran; 43 were excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria. The infants were randomly assigned to receive daily supplementation of Sprinkles (n=120), Foodlets (n=121) or Drops (n=121) for four months. Sprinkles and Foodlets contain iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin D, folate, and multiple B vitamins similar except that levels of iron are higher in the Sprinkles group. Drops do not contain zinc, vitamin B12, or folate. The persons responsible for the laboratory test and data entry were blinded to randomization. Haemoglobin, serum ferritin, serum retinol, serum zinc, 25(OH)D concentration and anthropometric measures were assessed at baseline and four months. At each monthly phase of the follow-up, adherence to supplements and side-effects related to supplements were reported by mothers. Six focus group discussions assessed mother&#8217;s perceptions about the supplements. Within group change in means over 4 months intervention was examined by Student&#8217;s paired t-test. The within group changes in proportions were assessed using McNemar&#8217;s test. Change across the three treatment groups were compared using analysis of covariance. Ethical clearance was obtained from the ethics committee of both the University of Queensland in Australia and the Ministry of Health in Iran. Results Of the total 362 infants included in the study, 313 (86%) had complete anthropometric and haemoglobin data, and 301 infants (83%) also had both initial and final serum samples. There were no significant differences between the three groups for baseline data. Baseline data showed approximately one fourth of anaemic children had iron deficiency anaemia and 38% of infants were zinc deficient. The children had a relatively good baseline status for vitamin A, vitamin D and growth. After four months intervention mean haemoglobin increased significantly in the three groups. Serum ferritin concentration increased in the Drops group (p&lt;0.001) and Sprinkles group (p&lt;0.05). A significant improvement was seen in zinc status for the Sprinkles and Foodlets but not the Drops group. Mean percentage of adherence to Sprinkles, Foodlets, and Drops (total amount of supplement used divided by total amount expected to be used) was (90.4&#177;17.25), (80.7&#177;25.01), and (88.5&#177;16.85) respectively. Vomiting was higher in the Foodlets compared to other groups (p&lt;0.001). Staining of the teeth was higher in Drops than the other groups (P&lt;0.001). Most mothers in the Sprinkles group (97.3%) preferred this supplement over current supplement whereas 87.2% of mothers in the Foodlet group preferred Foodlets over the current supplement. In the focus group discussions, mothers stated that the new supplements were more acceptable and easier to use compared to current supplement. However, they had some issues about the new supplements; for example, lack of appropriate food to add the Sprinkles or Foodlets. Conclusion The combination of multivitamins plus iron and zinc when added to wheat or rice-based complementary foods improved iron and zinc status. Combining iron and zinc in Sprinkles and Foodlets did not show negative effects on iron or zinc status. No differences were seen in efficacy of the Sprinkles and Foodlets on outcomes except a little higher improvement of iron status in Sprinkles and a slight higher weight gain of infants in the Foodlets group. According to this efficacy trial and formative study, Sprinkles had a higher acceptability in the study population and there are factors to encourage its use (easy to use, tasteless, containing all required vitamins and minerals, shape, easy to transfer, and stimulates appetite). The trial identified trade-offs in combining multiple micronutrients into a single delivery mechanism, with no benefit from addition of vitamins A and D on nutritional status in this sample of infants. We might consider different acceptability to Sprinkles in some regions by different cultural practices but in summary Sprinkles is likely to be the best option as an alternative choice to the current supplementation (Drops).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sprinkles, Foodlets, home fortification, multiple micronutrient supplement, infants, adherence, anaemia, zinc deficiency, infant&#8217;s growth, Iran</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sintering Behaviour of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) Powder Metallurgy Alloys</field><field name="creator">Enda Crossin</field><field name="description">The current, commercially available, press and sinter Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys are based on wrought or cast alloy compositions and have not been tailored for the press and sinter process. The limited development of the Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys for the press and sinter process can be partly attributed to a poor understanding of the effects of processing conditions on the sintering behaviour. The primary objective of this work was to investigate and understand the effects of processing conditions on the sintering behaviour of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) alloys. Dilatometry was used in conjunction with other experimental techniques to elucidate and understand the expansion and shrinkage events that occur during the liquid-phase sintering of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) powder metallurgy alloys. Samples were uni-axially pressed from elemental metal powder blends, de-waxed, and then sintered in a horizontal push-rod dilatometer to record the dimensional changes in the pressing direction. The processing conditions examined included the alloy composition, temperature, green density and atmosphere. A liquid forms during heating due to reactions between the alloying elements and the aluminium. This liquid is initially non-wetting on the oxide layer of the aluminium particles, resulting in separation of the particles, which is manifested by expansion of the sample. The oxide is reduced as sintering progresses, alleviating the non-wetting conditions. When more liquid forms, further expansion occurs, despite the improved wetting conditions. It is proposed that atmospheric oxygen and/or nitrogen can react with the liquid, forming a solid phase (&#8216;shell&#8217;) at the liquid-vapour interfaces. These shells prevent the liquid from wetting the particles, resulting in further expansion and preventing shrinkage. Unbalanced diffusivities (the Kirkendall effect) between the aluminium and silicon contribute to the expansion. A mechanism is proposed to account for the transition to shrinkage, whereby the shells at the liquid-vapour interface rupture when there is a rapid increase in the volume of contained liquid. The liquid then flows out and over the shells, onto the aluminium substrate, causing shrinkage. Magnesium and nitrogen delay the transition to shrinkage by facilitating nitride shell formation at the solid-liquid interface. Silicon and tin cause an earlier transition to shrinkage by increasing the liquid volume. In addition, tin promotes shrinkage by segregating to the liquid-vapour interfaces, limiting the thickness of the shells at the liquid-vapour interfaces. The two dominant liquid-phase shrinkage mechanisms during the sintering of Al-Mg-Si-Cu-(Sn) alloys are rearrangement and pore-filling. Contact-flattening is not a dominant shrinkage mechanism, but may occur concurrently with the other mechanisms. If contact flattening occurs, a decrease in the pressure of isolated pores increases the total shrinkage rate. Nitrogen increases the shrinkage rate during rearrangement by restricting grain-growth. Magnesium increases the shrinkage rate during rearrangement by reducing the solid-liquid interface energy. Magnesium and nitrogen are essential for the formation of nitride within isolated pores, which decreases the pore pressure and increases the contribution of contact-flattening on the total shrinkage rate. Silicon reduces the beneficial influence of magnesium during rearrangement by diluting the magnesium content in the liquid. Silicon increases the pore-filling rate due to an increase in the liquid volume. Magnesium increases the pore-filling rate by facilitating aluminium nitride formation within isolated pores and by increasing the pore-filling. Tin additions can decrease the pore-filling rate due to its segregation to the liquid-vapour interface, limiting the consumption of nitrogen within isolated pores.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sintering, powder metallurgy, aluminium, Al-Mg-Si</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Border Gods in Communities and Classrooms: Toward a Pedagogy of Enchantment</field><field name="creator">Dale Allender</field><field name="description">Mythology is a consistent part of the high school English language arts school curriculum dating back well beyond the last forty years. High school English teachers&#8216; beliefs about mythology, student engagement, and educational policy demonstrate the rationale and dynamic of this longevity. This study explores the development and elements of myth, asserting the importance of approaching myth through critical cultural studies generally, and in high school English arts classrooms specifically. Drawing upon a variety of cultural sources (i.e. sacred narrative, children&#8216;s television, cable news television, literature, movies, music, and the internet); theorists (from Levi-Strauss&#8216;s structuralism through the post-structuralism of Barthes, Anzuldua, and Maya Derrin); and methodologies (content analysis of murals, news excerpts, teacher footage on video literary analysis, and autoethnography) this study presents a critical cultural studies exploration of myth and myth studies. After deconstructing and applying Levi-Strauss&#8216; notion of Bricolage to a wide variety of contexts, I conclude that myth is based in all sorts of individual and collective human movement. And this movement gives rise to myth which can be characterized as political, spiritual inter-textual, performative and hybrid. I further conclude that a critical cultural studies approach to myth attends to student engagement, anticipates 21st century learning frameworks, and offers possible consideration of interfaith education in schools.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">13 Education</field><field name="subject">Mythology, critical cultural studies, literacy, secondary English education, English teachers, tricksters, African myth, media studies, narrative, travel</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Materials Informatics Workbench for Expediting the Discovery of Novel Compound Materials</field><field name="creator">Kwok Wai Steny Cheung</field><field name="description">This project presents a Materials Informatics Workbench that resolves the challenges confronting materials scientists in the aspects of materials science data assimilation and dissemination. It adopts an approach that has ingeniously combined and extended the technologies of the Semantic Web, Web Service Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL) and Open Archive Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE). These technologies enable the development of novel user interfaces and innovative algorithms and techniques behind the major components of the proposed workbench. In recent years, materials scientists have been struggling with the challenge of dealing with the ever-increasing amount of complex materials science data that are available from online sources and generated by the high-throughput laboratory instruments and data-intensive software tools, respectively. Meanwhile, the funding organizations have encouraged, and even mandated, the sponsored researchers across many domains to make the scientifically-valuable data, together with the traditional scholarly publications, available to the public. This open access requirement provides the opportunity for materials scientists who are able to exploit the available data to expedite the discovery of novel compound materials. However, it also poses challenges for them. The materials scientists raise concerns about the difficulties of precisely locating and processing diverse, but related, data from different data sources and of effectively managing laboratory information and data. In addition, they also lack the simple tools for data access and publication, and require measures for Intellectual Property protection and standards for data sharing, exchange and reuse. The following paragraphs describe how the major workbench components resolve these challenges. First, the materials science ontology, represented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), enables, (1) the mapping between and the integration of the disparate materials science databases, (2) the modelling of experimental provenance information acquired in the physical and digital domains and, (3) the inferencing and extraction of new knowledge within the materials science domain. Next, the federated search interface based on the materials science ontology enables the materials scientists to search, retrieve, correlate and integrate diverse, but related, materials science data and information across disparate databases. Then, a workflow management system underpinning the WSBPEL engine is not only able to manage the scientific investigation process that incorporates multidisciplinary scientists distributed over a wide geographic region and self-contained computational services, but also systematically acquire the experimental data and information generated by the process. Finally, the provenance-aware scientific compound-object publishing system provides the scientists with a view of the highly complex scientific workflow at multiple-grained levels. Thus, they can easily comprehend the science of the workflow, access experimental information and keep the confidential information from unauthorised viewers. It also enables the scientists to quickly and easily author and publish a scientific compound object that, (1) incorporates not only the internal experimental data with the provenance information from the rendered view of a scientific experimental workflow, but also external digital objects with the metadata, for example, published scholarly papers discoverable via the World Wide Web (the Web), (2) is self- contained and explanatory with IP protection and, (3) is guaranteed to be disseminated widely on the Web. The prototype systems of the major workbench components have been developed. The quality of the material science ontology has been assessed, based on Gruber&#8217;s principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge&#8211;sharing, while its applicability has been evaluated through two of the workbench components, the ontology-based federated search interface and the provenance-aware scientific compound object publishing system. Those prototype systems have been deployed within a team of fuel cell scientists working within the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (AIBN) at the University of Queensland. Following the user evaluation, the overall feedback to date has been very positive. First, the scientists were impressed with the convenience of the ontology-based federated search interface because of the easy and quick access to the integrated databases and analytical tools. Next, they felt the surge of the relief that the complex compound synthesis process could be managed by and monitored through the WSBPEL workflow management system. They were also excited because the system is able to systematically acquire huge amounts of complex experimental data produced by self-contained computational services that is no longer handled manually with paper-based laboratory notebooks. Finally, the scientific compound object publishing system inspired them to publish their data voluntarily, because it provides them with a scientific-friendly and intuitive interface that enables scientists to, (1) intuitively access experimental data and information, (2) author self-contained and explanatory scientific compound objects that incorporate experimental data and information about research outcomes, and published scholarly papers and peer-reviewed datasets to strengthen those outcomes, (3) enforce proper measures for IP protection, (4) comply those objects with the Open Archives Initiative Protocol &#8211; Object Exchange and Reuse (OAI-ORE) to maximize its dissemination over the Web and,(5) ingest those objects into a Fedora-based digital library.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">semantic web, web services, wsbpel, materials informatics, oai-ore, ontology, owl, swrl, data-driven approach, provenance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND BEACH MORPHODYNAMICS INDUCED BY LONG WAVES</field><field name="creator">Panut Manoonvoravong</field><field name="description">New laboratory data are presented on the influence of long waves on sediment transport in the surf zone. Due to the very significant difficulties in isolating the morphodynamic processes induced by long waves in field conditions, the laboratory study was designed practically to measure the net sediment transport rates, and gradients in sediment transport, arising from the interaction between long waves and short waves in the surf zone. The bathymetric evolution of model sand beaches, with dB50B = 0.2 mm, was observed under monochromatic short waves, long-wave short-wave combinations (free long waves), and bichromatic wave groups (forced long waves). The beach profile change and net cross-shore transport rates, Q(x), were extracted and compared for conditions with and without long waves. The experiments include a range of wave conditions, e.g. high-energy, moderate-energy, low-energy waves, and the beaches evolve to form accretionary, erosive, and intermediate beach states. Hydrodynamic measurements were made to identify the influence of long waves on short waves and to determine the correlation between surf zone bars and standing long waves. A shallow water wave model was modified for this application to surf zone morphodynamics and compared to both hydrodynamics and measured sediment transport. This data clearly demonstrate that free large-amplitude long waves influence surf zone morphodynamics not only under accretive conditions, by promoting onshore sediment transport, but also under erosive conditions, by decreasing offshore transport. For the dominant berm-bar feature, the strong surf beat induces offshore transport in the inner surf zone and onshore transport around the outer surf zone and throughout the shoaling zone. In contrast, forced (bound) long waves and wave groups correlated with bichromatic short wave groups play a pronounced role under erosive conditions, increasing offshore sediment transport across the whole beach profile. For accretionary conditions, only a very narrowbanded wave group promotes onshore sediment transport across the whole beach profile, while broader banded wave groups again promote offshore transport. The modified numerical model of Li et al. (2002) provides good predictions of the standing long wave pattern for the long-wave short-wave combinations, but generally poor agreement for the bichromatic wave groups. Similarly, this model performs poorly in terms of predicting the net sediment transport for all waves, even after optimising the sediment transport coefficients. This is because the model cannot predict the correct hydrodynamics around the breakpoint position and does not correctly represent net sediment transport mechanics. Overall, the model does not correctly predict the trends in beach profile evolution induced by the long waves and wave groups. Further, there is little evidence that the long wave nodal structure plays a dominant role. The influence of the free long waves and wave groups is consistent with the concept of the Gourlay parameter, H/wBsBT, as a dominant parameter controlling net erosion or accretion. Free long waves tend to reduce H/wBsBT, promoting accretion, while wave groups tend to increase H/wBsBT, promoting erosion.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Long waves, sediment transport, surf zone, monochromatic waves, long-wave short-wave</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:197793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antennas for Modern Indoor Wireless Communication Systems</field><field name="creator">Serguei Zagriatski</field><field name="description">Recent years have witnessed a growing demand for broadband wireless communication services such as on-the-go web-browsing, high speed data transfer and streaming of high definition multimedia. In response to this growth, there has been a rapid progress in research and development of technologies supporting high-speed wireless networks offering flexibility and scalability to heterogeneous consumer requirements. A fundamental challenge to the reliable operation of a wireless communication link is the wireless channel which is influenced by time-variant noise, interference, multipath and scarcity of the available frequency spectrum. Due to the wireless nature of the signal transmission and the manner in which energy is distributed or collected, an antenna has a profound influence on an efficient operation of wireless link. Because nowadays an antenna is required to work with many wireless standards, it poses one of the most difficult design and development technological problems. In the past, many antenna designs were concentrated on conventional outdoor applications such as satellite communications, terrestrial point to point communications and cellular base stations. In these applications, the primary design goal was the antenna electrical performance. In case of indoor applications, the designer has to pay attention not only to the electrical performance but also to mechanical, environmental and aesthetic features of antenna. In this thesis, the investigations into design and development of antenna for indoor wireless communication systems that are either currently widespread or quickly entering the consumer market are carried out. First, a single band circularly polarized Radial Line Slot Array antenna covering 2.4GHz ISM frequency spectrum of IEEE 802.11b/g protocol is proposed. Then, an access point antenna for IEEE 802.11a/b/g WLAN applications operating in a dual frequency band covering 2.4GHz and 5.2GHz frequency spectra is described. It consists of a RLSA antenna and a patch antenna combined in one body. During the design stage, in addition to characteristics such as return loss, radiation pattern and polarization, attention is paid to mechanical rigidity, light weight and low visual impact of these radiating structures. A low manufacturing cost is also part of the design strategy. This is important because of competitive commercial market of WLAN applications which is sensitive to the development cost. In theoretical investigations, a Field Matching Method is utilized to achieve a first order approximation to the coaxial-to-waveguide transition forming the feeding element of the RLSA antenna. Next, the full EM analysis (HFSS&#8482;) based on Field Element Method is applied to simulate the single and dual band antennas. Both types of access point antennas are manufactured and tested. Experimental results are compared with simulation results. The next part of this thesis presents the investigations into antenna diversity techniques for a wireless communication link in an indoor environment. The design of the automated experimental testbed is presented. This testing facility is used to measure the signal strength levels of a communication link between a mobile wireless device and an access point when they are equipped with multiple element antennas (MEAs). Special attention is given to the benefits of using MEA in a rich scattering environment that is accompanied the experiment. Full design details including electrical and mechanical features are provided. For a given feeding configuration, the testbed allows for measuring the received signal strength when the receiving module is moved over a circular area in an indoor environment. First set of experiments concerns the MEA system that utilizes two single-port transceivers each equipped with either 180&#186; or 90&#186; 3dB hybrid. By using alternatively one of the two input ports of the hybrids to feed a pair of monopole antennas several different transmission or reception modes of the 2x2 MEA communication link are investigated. The next set of experiments focuses on the performances of an indoor wireless system which uses either linearly or circularly polarized antennas at the two sides of the communication link. The overall diversity results indicate that by marginally increasing an overall system complexity (by using simple hybrid circuits and antennas), traditional transceiver systems equipped with MEA can provide significant improvements in the quality of indoor wireless link. The final part of this thesis presents the investigations into the design of planar monopole antennas that offer good return loss and omni-directional radiation pattern characteristics over an Ultra Wide frequency Band (UWB) spanning from 3.1GHz to 10.6GHz. Two types of planar monopole antennas are investigated. First, the ring type square with semi-circular base monopole antenna placed vertically above a finite ground plane is introduced followed by its design, manufacturing and testing. The second UWB antenna which is proposed in this thesis is a printed square with semi-circular base monopole antenna. This antenna is positioned in the same plane as ground and thus offers direct integration with a front-end circuitry of wireless transceiver. Several variations of this type of antenna featuring different outlines are designed, manufactured and tested. The obtained experimental results show a good agreement with the simulation results, as accomplished with the full EM analysis and simulation software HFSS&#8482;.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antenna</field><field name="subject">wireless</field><field name="subject">communications</field><field name="subject">rlsa</field><field name="subject">patch</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">testbed</field><field name="subject">uwb</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships Between Children&#8217;s Social Interactions and Theory of Mind Development: An Investigation of Pretend Play and Conflict Using Parent Reports</field><field name="creator">Angela Randell</field><field name="description">&#8220;Theory of mind&#8221; (ToM) has become an important theoretical construct in developmental psychology. It refers to the everyday ability to make sense of human behaviour, through an understanding of people as mentalising beings. This understanding is often assessed through a classic false belief test, though there is vast individual difference in the age at which this test is passed: most children pass the task at around the age of 4 years, with a range in the age of competence anywhere from 3 to 5 years in typically developing children. Given this considerable variation, much research in this field has examined factors which predict these individual differences, with one such line of enquiry focussing on social interaction experiences which might predict false belief task success. Research along this vein has examined factors such as family conversations and maternal language, though the aim of the current thesis was to examine the role of uniquely childish social interactions that might foster ToM. This focus was inspired by the finding that children who have siblings develop ToM precociously compared to singleton (only) children, suggesting that child-to-child interactions may indeed be particularly important for ToM development. Two uniquely childish interactions were chosen for examination: pretend play and conflict. While examining each of these social interactions, a somewhat novel methodological approach of a parent questionnaire was adopted, rather than direct, observational methods. Thus a secondary aim of the current thesis was to determine if the rich resource of parents could be usefully tapped to obtain information about child interactions. The first 2 empirical chapters of this thesis focussed on pretend play. The first chapter examined the question of whether pretence and ToM are linked in a cognitive sense, that is, whether understanding in pretence precedes understanding in belief, and whether these 2 areas of understanding are related to each other. This was achieved through 4 experiments, which replicated then modified the procedures of Custer (1996) and Hickling, Wellman and Gottfried (1997), using a sample of 210 children. The results of the experiments within this chapter suggested that pretence understanding did not precede belief understanding. However, pretence understanding was associated with ToM, begging the question as to why this might be so. The proposition offered was that the social and communication qualities of pretence might be more pertinent to ToM development than its representational qualities. Thus, in the second study of the current thesis, pretence was re-examined in relation to ToM, though this time, the social engagement attributes of this activity were focussed on. A total of 50 children were tested on their language ability and false belief, while their mothers completed a questionnaire about their play behaviour with their closest-in-age sibling. The results suggested that only social pretend play was related to ToM, not solitary pretend play. Moreover, within the context of social pretence, only games that were likely to involve role play were found to be related to ToM, other themes of pretence were not. In combination, the results of Study 1 and 2 of the thesis gave limited support to the proposed association between pretend play and theory of mind. Only social, role-play pretence was found to be relevant. Given that role play pretence is known to involve negotiations of roles and plans of action, it was proffered that children&#8217;s conflictual interactions with their peers might be a more fruitful area to explore in relation to ToM development. Therefore, the third and fourth studies in this thesis shifted focus towards children&#8217;s conflict interactions. In the third study, 54 children were tested on their language ability and false belief performance, while their mothers concurrently completed a questionnaire about children&#8217;s conflict behaviours with their closest-in-age sibling. The emotional qualities of children&#8217;s disputes with their siblings served as the primary focus of investigation, though other elements such as overall frequency, diversity, and mode of resolution were also examined. The results suggested that children who were able to remain relatively calm emotionally, both during and at the end of their sibling disputes, had the most advanced ToM understanding. The interesting and novel findings of Study 3 prompted further investigation of conflict interactions in relation to ToM. In study 4, a sample of 69 children was examined. Parents completed a questionnaire about sibling and peer disputes conjointly, which included rating the emotional qualities of these disputes as well as their child&#8217;s reasoning strategies during these interactions. Children were tested on their language ability, ToM and executive functioning. The results of this final study indicated that children with more advanced reasoning styles performed better on tests of false belief, and contrary to Study 3, the emotional qualities of their disputes were not significantly related to false belief. However, there was significant overlap between children&#8217;s reasoning style and the emotional qualities of their peer and sibling disputes, in that, children who had more advanced reasoning abilities tended to have calmer emotions during their conflicts. A further, novel finding of study 4 was the fact that the association between children&#8217;s argument styles and their false belief performance was mediated by their executive functioning skills for inhibitory control. Strengths and limitations are addressed in the final general discussion chapter. It is concluded that, although the questionnaire procedure adopted in the current thesis requires further validation, and longitudinal follow on of the results are warranted, the current thesis has substantially added to the extant literature. It has done so by providing a thorough analysis of 2 uniquely childish social interactions in relation to ToM, and through consideration of mediational influences of inhibitory control on these associations. In achieving these aims, the current thesis has suggested that parent questionnaires show promise as a means of obtaining rich information about children&#8217;s social interactions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Theory of Mind</field><field name="subject">Family Interactions</field><field name="subject">Social Development</field><field name="subject">Pretend Play</field><field name="subject">Conflict</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Use and Perceived Effectiveness of Recovery Modalities and Monitoring Techniques in Elite Sport</field><field name="creator">Melina Simjanovic</field><field name="description">Post-exercise recovery techniques are being used increasingly in elite sport, but scientific study in this area is only emerging. The aim of this study was to collect information on the use and perceived effectiveness of the different recovery techniques used with athletes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 Queensland Academy of Sport coaches and other high-performance coaches from seven sports (three team sports and four individual sports). The interview questions sought to examine the coaches&#8217; understanding of recovery, personal experiences, and the modalities and techniques used with their athletes. Interviews lasted an average of 45 minutes and were transcribed for qualitative content analysis and checked for accuracy by the coaches. Triangular consensus was used throughout the coding process to constantly revisit and redefine the open and axial codes that emerged. Three themes emerged: understanding of recovery, recovery modalities used, and monitoring of recovery. Understanding of recovery relates to the coaches&#8217; overall view and general understanding of recovery. Coaches reported that recovery consisted of physical, mental and neural components, and is important to the overall performance, repeated performance, and training of athletes. Coaches gained their recovery knowledge from a variety of sources across their own athlete and coaching pathways. Transferring this knowledge to athletes was perceived as important for enabling athletes to implement and adhere to recovery within their training plans. The recovery modalities used most often were low-intensity activity, stretching, nutrition, massage, contrast water immersion, cryotherapy, sleep and rest. Practicality and accessibility (e.g., time and cost) for the athletes&#8217; daily training environment were key factors influencing use of different recovery modalities. Coaches reported that they applied recovery modalities according to their own past coaching experiences or experiences of other coaches and sport science professionals. It appeared that coaches learn recovery information best by watching and speaking with others, especially other coaches and sports personnel. Factors contributing to use of recovery modalities include convenience and accessibility of a modality. Time restraint was an evident factor. Other factors that seem to contribute to the use of recovery modalities include the awareness of a modality&#8217;s existence, perceived modality strength of effect (or negative effect), and the compliance with and attitude of athletes to the modality. The personal experience of a coach using specific recovery modalities also impacted on whether the coach prescribed the modality and encouraged athletes to use the modality. However, it was clear from the study that athletes need to take responsibility for applying the recovery modalities themselves mainly because of logistical reasons. Recovery was monitored most often through informal observation rather than formal investigation. The most common monitoring approaches were coach observation and athlete reporting (diaries and discussions). Some coaches indicated that using a combination of approaches is useful and effective for gaining maximal benefits. Further investigation of monitoring approaches and prioritising them in terms of ease of implementation are needed. In summary, this study provided insight into the use of recovery modalities in elite sport and implications for use by professionals assisting coaches and athletes. In light of the limited research in some areas of recovery, a network could be established to capture the coaches&#8217; learned experiences and information on recovery to share with each other across different sports.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">recovery techniques, recovery modalities, recovery, monitoring techniques, effectiveness, athletes, coaches</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fantasy and Belief: fiction and media as conjunct locales for metaphysical questing and spiritual understanding</field><field name="creator">Danielle Kirby</field><field name="description">Recent years have seen an increase in alternative forms of religiosity and spirituality. In particular, a variety of alternative metaphysics and spiritualities are developing that explicitly integrate fiction, particularly fantasy, within their various paradigms. Such worldviews are notable in that they are not limited to the traditional realms of religious and spiritual engagement, but rather they extend comfortably into the worlds of contemporary popular and digital culture. This thesis is an exploration of the joint locales of fiction and new media as they relate to various forms of contemporary alternative metaphysics and spirituality. Starting with the particular case of the Otherkin, this thesis seeks to contextualize alternative beliefs that utilise fiction in relation to the broader cultural context within which they are occurring. This focus upon contextualisation emerges from the position that religious and spiritual ideologies that are heavily premised within popular culture will likely resist etic interpretation unless viewed in light of other contemporary non-religious cultural behaviours. This thesis endeavours to achieve three main goals: firstly, the provision of general information about the Otherkin as an exemplary instance of this confluence of themes; secondly, an exploration of parallel and intersecting behaviours and philosophies to be found within popular culture and occulture; and thirdly, to utilise an interpretative framework for such beliefs that does not require recourse to consumerist narratives. The discussion of alternative metaphysical beliefs and their situation finds its locus in the Otherkin; a loosely affiliated group of individuals who believe themselves to be in some way non-human. The types of creatures the Otherkin associate themselves with are sourced from numerous locales, from ancient mythological and folkloric narrative through to contemporary films and games. By exploring the various representations of the entities as well as the locales within which they occur, this thesis tracks a path through fiction and mythology, fan cultures and world creation, and occulture and the Internet.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alternative religion</field><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">Internet</field><field name="subject">mythical creatures</field><field name="subject">fantasy fiction</field><field name="subject">occulture</field><field name="subject">Popular Culture</field><field name="subject">otherkin</field><field name="subject">magic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CMRF-56+ BDC loaded with prostate TAA as a potential immunotherapy for prostate cancer.</field><field name="creator">Robert Coleman</field><field name="description">Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common visceral cancer amongst men in Australia and elsewhere in the world. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2006, PC alone would account for about 33% of newly diagnosed cancer in men, and be responsible for 9% of cancer related deaths in men. In men with advanced, metastatic PC, hormone therapy is widely accepted as the treatment of choice and produces good initial responses in most patients. However, many patients will relapse and become resistant to further hormone manipulation. Currently used treatment modalities for these patients are intended to palliate symptoms and therefore improve quality of life; the long term survival benefit of currently used management strategies is marginal at best. The limited treatment modalities with survival benefit for patients with advanced PC results in the need for development of novel therapies. Enhancement of the natural anti-tumour defences of the immune system to recognise and destroy tumour cells appears as a favourable alternative to prior therapies. Use of autologous dendritic cells (DC) as stimulators of an anti-tumour response has shown promise in several phase I, II and III trials. The Mater Medical Research Institute has developed a novel system for the isolation of blood DC (BDC). This system utilizes an antibody selection system based on a human/mouse chimeric CMRF-56 (huCMRF-56) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which has been engineered from the prototype murine IgG1 CMRF-56 mAb. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the huCMRF-56 mAb isolates a CMRF-56+ cell population comparable to that obtained with the murine IgG1 CMRF-56 mAb with a sufficient CMRF-56+ BDC purity and yield to warrant its use as a BDC based immunotherapy. The objective of this research project was to validate the use of the huCMRF-56 mAb isolated BDC preparations in PC immunotherapy. This was achieved by; i) determining the optimal concentration of the huCMRF-56 mAb at which to perform isolations in order to obtain a CMRF-56+ cellular preparation with purity, yield and cellular composition, in terms of DC subsets, B cells, monocytes and contaminating cells, comparable to that obtained with the murine mAb, which has shown efficacy in in vitro studies; ii) Demonstrating that CMRF-56+ preparations obtained from PC patients using the huCMRF-56 BDC mAb are comparable to those from healthy donors (HD) and iii) demonstrating functional capacity of both freshly isolated and cryopreserved CMRF-56+ BDC isolated preparations to induce anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in both HD and PC patients. These studies utilised the appropriate immunostaining techniques and flow cytometry to determine the CMRF-56+ cell yield, CMRF-56+ BDC purity and viability of the preparation. To determine functional capacity CMRF-56+ preparations were isolated from HD and PC patients, and loaded with the prostate tumour associated antigens (TAA) and control antigen peptides: prostate specific antigen-3 (PSA-3), prostatic acid phosphatase- 5 (PAP-5), prostatic specific membrane antigen-2 (PSMA-2), flu matrix protein (FMP) and/or melanoma antigen recognised by T cells (MART). Co-culture experiments were set up with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and induction of CTL responses were assessed using pentamer staining and ELISPOT assay. The working concentration of the huCMRF-56 mAb of 1.28mg/ml was determined to immunoselect a cellular preparation with maximal BDC purity, BDC yield and total viable cell number. Phenotyping studies of this preparation demonstrated it to be predominately comprised of antigen presenting cells (APC) and enriched for BDC with several BDC subsets immunoselected. CMRF-56+ preparations immunoselected from HD and PC donors were similar and comparable to previously described preparations immunoselected using the original murine CMRF-56 mAb. From antigen loaded CMRF-56+ preparations, specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 restricted CD8 lymphocyte responses were generated against prostate TAAs in 2 of 5 HD and 1of 3 PC donors and against FMP in 1 of 3 PC and 5 of 5 HD. Cryopreserved antigen loaded CMRF-56+ BDC preparations from HD generated antigen specific FMP or MART-1 CTL responses in 3 of 4 HD, however anti-prostate TAA CTL responses were not observed. The humanised CMRF-56 mAb immunoselects a cellular preparation enriched in BDC and capable of effective uptake and presentation of antigen. The CMRF-56+ BDC enriched preparation, loaded with PC TAA is capable of inducing specific anti tumour responses in vitro. While further preclinical studies are required, the preparation, loaded with PC TAA shows promise as a potential immunotherapy for PC.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dendritic Cell</field><field name="subject">immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">CMRF-56</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DELIVERY OF SMALL INTERFERING RNA FOR CANCER TREATMENT</field><field name="creator">Sherry Wu</field><field name="description">The ability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence specific target genes offers not only a tool to study gene function but also represents a novel approach for the treatment of various human diseases, including cancers. The clinical use of siRNA, however, has been severely hampered by the inefficient delivery of these molecules to target cell populations due to their instability, inefficient cell entry, and poor pharmacokinetic profile. Much effort has therefore been devoted to the development of efficient in vivo siRNA delivery systems, with liposomes being the most widely employed vector. The traditional methods of packaging siRNA into liposomes, however, are often quite complex and labour-intensive, with the resulting products also being unstable at room temperature which limits their wide spread application in the clinic. The main aim of this research was to develop a simple, yet efficient, formulation technique to prepare stable siRNA-loaded liposomes which could be utilized as an efficient therapy for cancer treatment. Throughout this study, cervical cancer was used as the model system to assess the efficiency of various delivery systems. It is an ideal disease for siRNA therapy due to the cancer&#8217;s reliance on the expression of a single messenger RNA sequence which encodes two essential viral oncogenes, E6 and E7. Previous research has shown that targeting E6 and E7 by siRNA in cervical cancer cells in vitro results in either cell senescence or apoptosis. This thesis investigates the feasibility of applying E6/7 siRNA both intravaginally and intravenously to model the treatment of early-stage and end-stage cervical cancer, respectively. The practicability of applying E6/7 siRNA intravaginally for the treatment of localised cervical cancer tumours was firstly evaluated by administrating liposome-complexed siRNAs directly into the vaginal cavity of transgenic E7 mice. As no knockdown of E7 in cervical epithelium was observed for mice which received repeated treatments of E6/7 siRNA, the vaginal delivery efficiency of liposomes was further examined using fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotides. Contrary to previous reports, no delivery of lipoplexes into cervicovaginal tissues was detected irrespective of the dosage, type of lipid vector used, or the mouse estrus state at the time of administration. This lack of delivery was likely due to the poor retention of lipoplexes in the vaginal cavity as well as the inefficient penetration of lipoplexes across the mucosal layer lining the cervicovaginal epithelium. Overall, these findings indicated the necessity of developing more suitable and clinically acceptable vaginal siRNA delivery systems to enable this treatment strategy to become a reality. Despite the challenges of using liposomes to deliver siRNA via vaginal administration, their successful use in delivering siRNA intravenously to tumours was demonstrated in a subcutaneous cervical cancer mouse model. These experiments were carried out using PEGylated siRNA-loaded liposomes which were formulated using a novel Hydration-of-Freeze-Dried-Matrix (HFDM) technique. Compared to the existing formulation strategies, this method of preparation is less labour-intensive and the end product is also freeze-dried, ensuring product stability. It was found that the liposomes prepared using the HFDM method were stable in the presence of serum and they also possessed high siRNA entrapment and gene-silencing efficiencies. Following intravenous administration to mice, these particles were also found to accumulate in subcutaneous tumours to a similar degree compared to formulations prepared using a previously established technique. Importantly, these HFDM-formulated preparations showed superior stability over ones prepared using the traditional formulation method, with the particles still retaining 100% of their gene-silencing ability after storage for one month at room temperature. Using HFDM-formulated liposomes loaded with siRNA against Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP), a 50% knockdown of the GFP expression was achieved in tumours following intravenous administration. Additionally, the use of E6/7-targeted siRNA also resulted in a 50% reduction in tumour size when the siRNAs were delivered using HFDM-formulated liposomes. Importantly, this level of tumour growth suppression was comparable to that achieved from cisplatin, a clinically used chemotherapeutic for cervical cancer, at the clinically used dose. Overall, this research demonstrated that while there are still some challenges to overcome for siRNA to be used vaginally for cervical cancer treatment, HFDM-formulated PEGylated liposomes showed promise in bringing E6/7 siRNA forward as a treatment option for end-stage cervical cancer. In addition, the simplicity of preparation procedure along with superior product stability obtained from the HFDM method developed in this thesis will likely facilitate the translation of siRNA technology from laboratory to clinics for a range of other medical applications.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RNA interference</field><field name="subject">siRNA</field><field name="subject">Liposomes</field><field name="subject">Gene Delivery</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hotel Restaurant Co-branding: The Relationship of Perceived Brand Fit, Perceived Risk and Perceived Value with Intention to Purchase</field><field name="creator">Ann Suwaree Ashton</field><field name="description">Abstract This study examines the relationship between perceived brand fit, perceived risk, perceived value and intention to purchase in the context of co-branded hotels and restaurants. Today&#8217;s market contains many products and services that can look very similar, and companies use co-branding of their products to make them distinctive from other products on the market. A better understanding of consumer behaviour and attitude to co-branding may improve restaurant profitability and hotel occupancy. One important question to be considered is what determines consumers&#8217; willingness to purchase in co-branded hotel and restaurants? In spite of a number of research papers on hotel-restaurant co-branding written in recent years, previous academic studies have not addressed the relationship between co-branding of hotels and restaurants and intention to purchase. The aim of this research is to examine how the relationship of brand fit, risk and value relate to intention to purchase, and to do this three research questions and eleven hypotheses are proposed. A previous study by Boo and Matilla (2002) has proposed a conceptual model of hotel-restaurant brand alliance strategies, relating management strategy characteristics and consumer characteristics with the consequences of perceived brand fit. The present study develops this existing model by examining the components of brand fit that determine consumer intention to purchase. The study investigates three main areas: firstly, it examines the relationship between perceived brand fit and intention to purchase in terms of perceived fit (overall), complementary fit based on product usage and product goal, and transferability fit based on service quality. Secondly, it examines the relationship between perceived risk and intention to purchase in terms of personal characteristics including risk-taking behaviour and self-confidence; uncertainty of loss including financial loss, time loss and physical loss, and, performance risk. Thirdly, it examines the relationship between perceived value and intention to purchase in terms of perceived brand image, perceived quality and perceived sacrifice, based on monetary and non-monetary price. A quantitative approach involving survey of hotel guests has been employed with data collected in four and five star hotels in Bangkok and Pattaya, Thailand from August to September 2008. A survey questionnaire was administered to guests and a total of 511 completed responses were collected. The data analyses performed using a standard multiple regression method, a paired sample T-test, a chi-square test and a multiple response technique. The results indicate that the model of perceived brand fit in this study has two key components which positively influence a consumer&#8217;s intention to purchase. Firstly, the perceived fit (overall), and, secondly, complement fit based on product usage and product goal. Furthermore, for the perceived risk model the finding also indicates two key components which positively influence a consumer&#8217;s intention to purchase. The first component is uncertainty of loss in terms of financial, time and physical loss. The second component is performance risk in terms of product and service performance. Lastly, the results indicate that the perceived value model revealed three components which are positively related to consumer&#8217;s intention to purchase. The first component is perceived brand image, the second component is perceived quality, and the last component is perceived sacrifice in terms of both monetary and non-monetary price. The conceptual framework developed and tested in this study can be used as a guideline to enable an appropriate co-branding marketing strategy to be developed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hotel Restaurant Co-branding,</field><field name="subject">Perceived fit</field><field name="subject">Perceived risk</field><field name="subject">Perceived value</field><field name="subject">Intention to purchase</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'golden hour': an examination of mortality from major trauma in an informal, decentralised state-wide emergency medical system</field><field name="creator">Vivienne Tippett</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Key words: major trauma, mortality, emergency pre-hospital, performance indicators. Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classifications: Division 11 (Medical and Health Sciences); Group 1117 (Public Health and Health Services) Background Response times are a common performance measure for many ambulance services and emergency medical response systems and are considered to be a standard measure of emergency medical services quality. The development of formalised Emergency Medical Systems in Australia and internationally have almost universally assumed a link between shorter response times and improved patient outcome measured by survival. While the evidence to support time-criticality for patients who experience a cardiac arrest is considered unequivocal, the assumption that response and scene times are universally important across all patient groups is not consistently supported by the research evidence. Little is known about whether or not the importance of time-dependent performance measures vary as a function of the Emergency Medical System arrangements to which they apply, the skill set of attending paramedics or the epidemiology of the target population. Despite this, response times continue to be one of the key performance measures for ambulance services regardless of the wider health services system in which they operate. Given the significant investment in paramedic training and increasing levels of clinical responsibility witnessed in the last decade, the development of a robust body of evidence about whether this investment and expertise alters outcomes for patients is yet to develop and there has been little shift in measures of performance. Major traumatic injury is associated with significant disease burden in Australia as elsewhere in the world. An estimated 1,500 Queenslanders die each year as a result of major traumatic injury and injury remains the single most common cause of death in Queenslanders between the ages of 1 and 35 years. As such, injury has a massive impact on the health of Queenslanders. Each year, around 10% of Queenslanders will suffer from an injury of some kind and it is known that injury results in 10% of all hospital admissions and 40-60% of attendances at hospital Emergency Departments. In Australia, injury is recognised as one of the seven National Health Priority Areas by the Australian Government. While this document provides for the setting of broad targets for reduction in injury and its social, economic and health corollaries, little advice is provided regarding health service performance with this target group. The emergency pre-hospital environment is absent in this and most strategic policy documents of this ilk in Australia. This thesis has two core aims: &#8226; to provide for the first time a descriptive analysis of major trauma in Queensland for the period 1998-2001 including description of the systemic factors influencing patient mortality; and in the light of these findings to &#8226; examine the utility of emergency pre-hospital time-dependent performance indicators as predictors of mortality in this patient group. The period of interest 1998-2001 was selected to provide a baseline for the development of the Queensland Trauma Plan implemented by government in 2007. Methods This thesis involved three key activities: (1) a review of the literature on the basis for time-dependent measures of pre-hospital performance in trauma, impacts of system design and emergency pre-hospital skill set on mortality from major trauma; (2) a descriptive quantitative analysis of linked patient data over a four year period (1998-2001) of the relationship between pre-hospital time and mortality; and (3) the theoretical development of alternative emergency pre-hospital performance measures for trauma. Results Of the 23,462 patients in the study population, 29.0% (n= 6,793) died as a consequence of their injuries. Fifteen percent (15.0%) of the patients died in the pre-hospital environment. After adjustment for age, sex and severity (GCS&lt;9) and the presence or absence of co-morbidities, a response interval in excess of 10 minutes (the State benchmark for high acuity cases) did not affect all-cause, all-age mortality from major trauma (OR 1.03; 95%CI 0.93-1.13) compared to response times &lt; 10 minutes. Similarly, no significant effect of response interval &gt;10 minutes (OR 1.11; 95%CI 0.98-1.26) was noted in the pre-hospital period. Scene time &gt;20 minutes (OR 0.75; CI 0.65-0.86) improved the chance of survival to hospital by comparison to scene times &lt;20 minutes. At all times in the pre-hospital care continuum, the presence of an Intensive Care Paramedic improved survival (OR 1.29; 95%CI 1.13-1.48) when compared to solely Advanced Care Paramedic crews, however this effect was not sustained for overall mortality. Conclusions Traditional time-dependent emergency pre-hospital performance measures are not associated with pre-hospital survival from major traumatic injury in Queensland. This finding differs from the experience of similar systems in Canada and elsewhere and may be due to differences in trauma profile, system arrangements, skill sets and funding models. Alternatively, the system operating in Queensland may in fact be optimised in terms of response, scene and transfer times given the size and geography of the State. This study has confirmed the positive survival benefit associated with highly skilled paramedics in the field and demonstrates that time-dependent performance measures should not be considered proxy measures of survival. New performance indicators specifically targeted to patient outcomes need to be developed to monitor the performance of trauma systems in the pre-hospital sector.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">major trauma, , , performance indicators.</field><field name="subject">mortality</field><field name="subject">emergency pre-hospital</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Philosophical Conceptions of Time, Space, Difference and Repetition in the Early Novels of Alain Robbe-Grillet</field><field name="creator">Craig Adams</field><field name="description">This study of Alain Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s first four published novels seeks to examine the manifestations of four different philosophical concepts in these works. Each novel will be taken as a primary example of Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s interrogation of either time, space, difference or repetition. The title of this work, &#8216;Philosophical Conceptions of Time, Space, Difference and Repetition in the Early Novels of Alain Robbe-Grillet&#8217;, as apparently uncomplicated as it is, is useful not only for directly implicating the topics to be examined, but also for what it does not directly allude to. By making reference neither to Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s involvement in the movement of the Nouveau Roman nor the theoretical ideas he developed, the title demonstrates one of the main approaches employed here; for Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s novels will be examined first and foremost for the textual qualities they exhibit, and will not be tested against the author&#8217;s statements, as is most often the case in studies of Robbe-Grillet. When examining these novels, we will thus neither support our study with quotations from Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s many interviews and public statements, nor concern ourselves with the apparent objectivity or subjectivity of the novels&#8217; narrators, nor will we base our examinations of the philosophical concepts found in the novels on questions of subjectivity or objectivity. It will become clear throughout our work that Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s novels, particularly the early novels that are the focus of this work, have been very well researched and from many different perspectives, yet in spite of the proliferation of texts dealing with these novels certain standard readings have evolved that impinge on the advancement of our understanding of Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s complex works. We will argue that this is precisely because these readings actually negate the multiple interpretations that the novels demand and that these standardised readings therefore work as fixed central points around which almost all analyses of the novels revolve. It is thus the aim of this work to complicate these dominant readings by engaging with the ways in which the novels both offer and deny different interpretations, a strategy that ultimately results in the impossibility of a sole fixed reading. In choosing this approach to study the novels, we wish to concentrate solely on the non-representative aspects of these novels. That is to say, the novels will not be treated here, as they are by many critics, for the way they present themselves on the surface as merely concerned with an interrogation of narrative strategies, characterisation or with an application of Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s theoretical modus operandi. Rather we will argue that the texts simultaneously invite a deeper reflection on philosophical concepts. The possibility the novels offer to consider the four philosophical concepts that are the focus of this study will be remarked by the novels&#8217; continual engagement with these ideas so as to suggest finally the opportunity of conceiving of these concepts in a literary discourse. Thus, the philosophical concepts which will be deployed in examining Robbe-Grillet&#8217;s novels aim to elucidate not strict equivalences between a given concept and its expression in the novel, but rather the ways in which the novels themselves can be seen to propose their own conceptions of these philosophical notions. Thus, each of these chapters will ostensibly deal with a particular philosophical notion, yet they can be seen to work towards a similar shared goal; for each section of this study will propose that it is impossible to isolate a single unifying thesis or central controlling identity through which the texts can be examined. Instead, we will suggest that the novels are governed by a logic of difference in itself, a philosophical notion which, as we will see throughout this work, operates outside of the notion of identity and which favours fluid, unstable and continuously evolving relationships of its constituent parts.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alain Robbe-Grillet</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">Difference</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">repetition</field><field name="subject">Nouveau Roman</field><field name="subject">Gilles Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Jacques Derrida</field><field name="subject">Henri Bergson</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Importance of protein-protein interactions on protein crystallisation</field><field name="creator">Chirag Mehta</field><field name="description">There is a strong link between solubility, and thus crystallisation, and the molecular interactions of proteins in dilute salt solutions. Such molecular interactions are governed by the weak interaction forces (electrostatic, hydration and hydrophobic). Such forces can be quantitatively estimated in terms of a second virial self-coefficient (B22) and a second virial cross-coefficient (B23) for a single and a binary protein system, respectively. Previous studies confirmed the relation between a value of the second virial coefficient and a type of interaction (attractive or repulsive). The aim of this thesis is to correlate the second virial coefficient with the solubility and nucleation for single and binary protein systems. Model proteins used in this work are lysozyme and ovalbumin from egg-white, and &#945;-amylase from Bacillus Licheniformis (BLA). The measurements are performed for sodium chloride and ammonium sulphate solutions in an acidic pH at 20 oC. Interaction chromatography is used in this work to estimate the B22 and B23 values for the model proteins in salt solutions. From the measured values of B22 and B23, the type of interaction is generalised as a function of the salt type, salt concentration, pH and protein type. For the single protein systems, in ammonium sulphate solutions (0.1 - 2.4 M) at pH 4.0 and 7.0, repulsion or no interactions are observed below 0.8 M and, as the salt concentrations are increased attractive self-interactions are observed for the model proteins. However, for the sodium chloride solutions (0.1 - 2.0 M) at pH 4.0 and 7.0, the interaction patterns vary with the salt concentration, the pH and the type of protein studied. A common feature of the self-interaction for all the model proteins is the attractive interactions close to the isoelectric point. For the binary protein systems, three distinct regions are observed in the ammonium sulphate solutions (0.1 - 1.6 M) at pH in the range 4.0 - 7.0. Attractive or no cross-interactions are observed at low salt concentrations (&lt; 0.5 M). At the intermediate salt concentrations (0.5 - 1.0 M), the cross-interactions are constant and near zero. This is followed by a sharp increase in the attractive interactions above 1.0 M ammonium sulphate concentrations. However, for sodium chloride solutions (0.1 - 1.6 M) at pH 4.0 - 7.0, two distinct regions are observed. Attraction or no interactions are observed at low salt concentrations (&lt; 0.5 M) and above 0.5 M concentrations of sodium chloride, negligible cross-interactions are observed between model proteins. For the single protein system, an overall increase in the solubility of three model proteins is observed with an increase in the concentrations of ammonium sulphate and also for sodium chloride solutions except for BLA, where a salting-in behaviour is observed. Linear regression is used on the solubility data to determine the parameters of the Cohn equation (&#946; and Ks) where the values of &#946; vary with solution pH, protein type and salt type. The values of Ks vary with protein type and salt type. However, it is insensitive to the solution pH for lysozyme in ammonium sulphate, ovalbumin in sodium chloride and BLA in ammonium sulphate solutions. For the binary protein system, the presence of ovalbumin had a measurable effect on lysozyme solubility at pH &lt; 5.0 in both salts. In low concentration sodium chloride solutions (&lt; 0.3 M), a decrease in the solubility of lysozyme was observed with the presence of ovalbumin at acidic pH &lt; 5.0. However, in ammonium sulphate solutions, the lysozyme solubility increases with the addition of ovalbumin in the salt concentration range 1.6 - 2.0 M and at pH &lt; 4.0. The primary nucleation threshold values are also determined for lysozyme in sodium chloride and ammonium sulphate solutions. In sodium chloride solutions (0.2 - 1.0 M), the critical supersaturation values increase as the solution pH is raised from 4.0 to 7.0; however in ammonium sulphate solutions (1.0 - 2.0 M), the reverse effect is observed. The critical supersaturation required to nucleate lysozyme in ammonium sulphate solutions is approximately three times higher than in sodium chloride solutions. For the single protein systems, the measured values of solubility and B22 were correlated using published models (RSL and HDW). For each protein-salt combination, a reasonable single correlation between solubility and B22 is possible as the salt concentrations and pH are varied. There are separate correlations for sodium chloride and ammonium sulphate solutions. Based on the correlation curve of solubility and B22, it is proposed that the acidic pH range (4.0 - 5.0) is better for crystallising and precipitating globular proteins from these salt solutions. If the values of solubility and B22 are converted into a non-dimensional quantity, the data derived from the different protein-salt systems collapse onto a single curve for the same salt type. The B22 values are also correlated with the critical supersaturation (ln(c*/S)) for the primary nucleation of lysozyme in salt solutions. The values of the critical supersaturation increase as the values of the second virial coefficient become negative or reduce. The ideal critical supersaturation required to create nuclei of lysozyme in salt solutions is between 0.1 and 1.4. For the binary protein systems, B23 values were related to the slope of the lysozyme and ovalbumin plot at same salt concentration and solution pH. Further work is required for binary protein systems to generalise such correlations as a function of the salt concentration and pH. The correlations derived in this thesis are useful generally to predict the solubility and primary nucleation of globular protein in salt solutions. This work reinforces the importance of the second virial coefficient in predicting the crystallisation of protein in salt solutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein solubility</field><field name="subject">primary nucleation</field><field name="subject">second virial coefficient</field><field name="subject">Interaction Chromatography</field><field name="subject">Binary Mixture</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BRING THE BOMBS OUT OF THE BASEMENT: THE UNITED STATES, THE NPT,AND THE NUCLEAR NON-SIGNATORIES, 1961-1974</field><field name="creator">Eliza Matthews</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Since the dawn of the atomic age, the United States of America [US] saw the problem of nuclear proliferation as one of its own creation and therefore theirs to rectify. Perhaps motivated by a form of nuclear imperialism, the US held the majority of the aspiration and ability to solve the international problem of nuclear proliferation. In hindsight there is perhaps very little that successive presidential administrations could have done to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons during this period without significantly affecting their own international ambitions. However, the possibility that the US could have obtained the signatures of the nuclear non-signatories of India, Pakistan and Israel on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968) [NPT] became more remote due to the determination of those states to act independently and demonstrate their authority over their own nuclear matters in the shadow of both the superpowers during the Cold War. Furthermore, the American failure to obtain early agreement on the nuclear issue meant that the long-term nuclear ambitions of these nations could not be reversed. Exploiting an array of archival sources, Bring the Bombs out of the Basement analyses the process by which the US sought to bring these non-compliant states into the nuclear non-proliferation regime. It also discusses the significance of the failure of the US to bring the nuclear non-signatories into the fold. Studying the problem under the framework of the NPT as the cornerstone of the nuclear non-proliferation system, it focuses on the period between 1961 and 1974 &#8211; from the intensification of NPT negotiations under President John F. Kennedy, to the year in which India detonated its first nuclear device. By analysing the diplomatic interactions between the US and India, Pakistan and Israel, this thesis examines why the US was unable to politically tame one of the most significant scientific research achievements of all time and wield influence in the nuclear arena commensurate to its superpower status. In terms of uniqueness, this is the first study to have comprehensively examined and compared US nuclear policy towards only the nuclear non-signatories.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">21 History and Archaeology</field><field name="subject">United States - foreign relations</field><field name="subject">nuclear weapons</field><field name="subject">non-proliferation</field><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Pakistan</field><field name="subject">Israel</field><field name="subject">South Asia</field><field name="subject">history</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:198989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Careers or Babies? What Young Australian Women Want</field><field name="creator">Melissa Johnstone</field><field name="description">Abstract The majority of young Australian women aspire to be married with at least one child and in some form of paid employment by the time they are 35 years of age. In an age of increasing female labour force participation, it seems then that young women really can have it all. However, while younger generations of women are now more likely than their male counterparts to go to university, Australian women, compared to women in other countries, have low workforce participation rates after childbearing; and many move to part-time positions characterised by lower earnings, less responsibility and less opportunity for training and promotion. Further, there continues to be significant occupational segregation in the workplace, and women continue to earn significantly less than men. Why are Australian women not utilizing their skills to their full potential? The issue of balancing paid work with family responsibilities is central to this debate; and crucial is the role of Australian work-family legislation, which has previously focussed on improving Australia&#8217;s low fertility rate through financial aids rather than recognising women&#8217;s increased attachment to the paid workforce. This underscores the need for further research on how young Australian women negotiate work and family, to contribute to the evidence base for the formation of policy that supports the needs of young Australian women. This thesis takes an innovative approach of examining the work and family aspirations of a new generation of young Australian women negotiating work and family, transitioning from their late teens/early twenties to their early 30s. A prominent theoretical model of women&#8217;s work and family preferences, Lifestyle Preference Theory, postulates that women&#8217;s work and family outcomes are primarily the result of what they had always aspired, and that all women living in contemporary society can &#8216;choose&#8217; their preferred type of lifestyle. However, as argued in this thesis, this model doesn&#8217;t take into account women&#8217;s circumstances, systemic-level supports and life changes that impact upon women&#8217;s decisions. Further, compared to previous generations of women, when most of the research on women&#8217;s aspirations was conducted, there is a new development process bridging adolescence and early adulthood, termed Emerging Adulthood. Using a mixed-methods approach of quantitative and qualitative analyses, this thesis examines young Australian women&#8217;s work and family aspirations according to their life experiences and within the social and structural constraints on their lives, during this developmental period of the life course and new socio-historical context. Chapter 1 provides a historical context to women&#8217;s changing roles and increasing workforce participation over past decades, while also discussing the pervasiveness of gender stereotypes and gender differences in the workforce. Chapter 2 discusses the Australian context in more depth; including work and family trends and systemic-level work-family support. This section also introduces theoretical contributions in the area of women&#8217;s aspirations, and developmental changes likely to affect young women. Chapter 3 then provides an analysis of young Australian women&#8217;s work and family aspirations, including the consistency of their aspirations over time, using nationally representative data from the younger cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#8217;s Health (ALSWH). Chapters 4 and 5 examine the representativeness of Lifestyle Preference Theory as a model of young Australian women&#8217;s work and family aspirations. Chapter 4 investigates whether Australian women can be categorised as &#8216;types&#8217; committed to pursuing a particular lifestyle while Chapter 5 investigates whether women&#8217;s aspirations are independent of context, as theorised by Lifestyle Preference Theory, or correlated to women&#8217;s circumstances and the constraints on their lives. Chapters 6 and 7 aim to give voices to the experiences of young Australian women forming their aspirations during this period of the lifespan, by analysing qualitative comments from the younger cohort of the ALSWH. Chapter 6 provides a context of what is important and happening in the lives of young Australian women, while Chapter 7 provides a more thorough discussion of women&#8217;s comments about their aspirations and with a comparative discussion of their comments to current theoretical models. Through an analysis of focus group material, Chapter 8 continues to examine the experiences of young women during this developmental period of the lifespan. This Chapter reviews young women&#8217;s thoughts on their aspirations for work and family, how they anticipate making work and family decisions, and how they perceive and experience this developmental period of the lifespan. Chapters 9 and 10 return to the quantitative data of the ALSWH to investigate why women change their aspirations over time, and specifically look at the impact of first birth and life events on women&#8217;s motherhood and employment aspirations. These Chapters discuss the role of systemic-level work-family support on women&#8217;s changing aspirations. Chapter 11 provides an integrative conclusion of findings, which show that women are forming and adjusting their aspirations as best they can within their circumstances and the constraints on their lives, and the broader context of Australia&#8217;s work and family support systems. This Chapter provides recommendations for policy and directions for future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aspirations</field><field name="subject">young Australian women</field><field name="subject">employment</field><field name="subject">motherhood</field><field name="subject">work-family</field><field name="subject">Lifestyle Preference Theory</field><field name="subject">Emerging Adulthood</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Upstream Wall Layer Effects on Drag Reduction with Boundary Layer Combustion</field><field name="creator">Rainer Matthias Kirchhartz</field><field name="description">One of the major challenges of scramjet propulsion remains the generation of sufficient thrust to overcome the large drag of hypersonic vehicles. Since the viscous drag constitutes a large portion of the overall drag, its mitigation offers potential for performance improvement. Viscous drag is generated on all wetted surfaces of the vehicle but is largest in the scramjet combustion chamber, where the fluid not only has a high flow speed, but also a high density. Reduction of the skin friction drag in the combustor hence promises large improvements to the efficiency of the propulsive system. Stalker (2005) proposed a novel approach to skin friction reduction that is based on the combustion of hydrogen within the turbulent boundary layer of supersonic or hypersonic flow. An extension to the theory of van Driest II was developed that suggests that the effectiveness of this method is significantly superior to that of film cooling without combustion effects. In essence, the combustion heat release reduces the velocity gradient at the wall and the density in the boundary layer so that the momentum transfer to the wall is decreased. This work investigates the applicability of this skin friction reduction method to scramjet combustors that would operate at flight Mach numbers between 8 and 13 at altitudes between 34 and 39 km. The corresponding combustor Mach number is approximately 4.5 and the total enthalpies are between 3.6 and 7.8 MJ/kg. Experiments that directly measured the skin friction drag on the internal scramjet combustor surface were conducted in the T4 Stalker tube at The University of Queensland. A constant area, axisymmetric combustor was tested with a matching constant area, axisymmetric inlet that did not compress the oncoming flow. Therefore, the experiments were of a quasi-direct-connect nature where the inlet was used to condition the wall layer of the flow that enters the combustion chamber. The start of the combustor was formed by a step at the end of the inlet which contained an annular slot for the injection of the gaseous hydrogen fuel. Fuel was injected tangentially to the main stream flow into the circular combustor as a uniform layer underneath the established boundary layer from this annular slot. Combustion was monitored via the measurement of the axial pressure distribution in the combustor and viscous forces on the combustor were measured with a stress wave force balance. Two different inlet lengths were tested to assess the effect of the boundary layer state and thickness on the ignition and combustion of the injected hydrogen. The leading edge of the inlet was either sharp or blunt to investigate the effect of the hot gas that is contained in an entropy layer that is generated by a blunt leading edge. Finally, the diameter of the duct was varied to ensure that the experimental data was not subject to duct scaling effects. The effect on skin friction of the combustion of fuel in the boundary layer was assessed directly by measurement as well as analytically with several prediction methods. The experimental data show reductions of skin friction drag of up to 77% when stable combustion was established. A thick, turbulent boundary layer results in ignition for lower enthalpy conditions than a thin, laminar layer. The blunted leading edge configuration creates conditions that results in ignition of the injected fuel at all tested flow enthalpies and when a sharp leading edge configuration does not. Analytical predictions of the skin friction drag are in close agreement with the experimental data for fuel-off, film cooling and boundary layer combustion cases. It is demonstrated that the characteristics of boundary layer combustion do not change when the duct diameter is increased and the hydrogen mass flow rate per unit circumferential length is kept constant.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="subject">drag</field><field name="subject">skin friction</field><field name="subject">boundary layer combustion</field><field name="subject">airbreathing propulsion</field><field name="subject">hypersonics</field><field name="subject">supersonic combustion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Patriarchs: A Biographical Approach to the History of Australian Lutheran Schooling 1839 - 1919</field><field name="creator">Richard Hauser</field><field name="description">This is a thesis about Lutherans and their schools in Australia. There have been Lutheran schools in Australia for more than 170 years. The first three schools were established in 1839. Currently there are eighty-three Lutheran schools with total enrolments of approximately 37 000 students. In the intervening period there have been two great waves of development. The first began with the first schools in 1839 and reached its climax at the end of the nineteenth century before the advent of state schools and the anti-German sentiment of the Great War caused a period of decline. The second wave, fuelled by government funding and some disillusionment with state schools, gathered its momentum in the last half of the twentieth century and is still in full flow. This thesis deals with the first wave, the eighty years of Lutheran schooling history from 1839 to 1919. It is an exercise in educational historiography and takes a biographical approach. According to its title it focuses on the lives and roles of the male leaders who dominated the church&#8217;s educational endeavours during this period. The subjects of the eight biographies are chosen to be representative of regions, eras and issues. They are: August Kavel, the founder of Australian Lutheranism and its schooling system; Daniel Fritzsche, the first Lutheran tertiary educator; Wilhelm Boehm, founder of the Hahndorf Academy in South Australia; Rudolph Ey, a Lutheran pastor and teacher in South Australia; Theodor Langebecker, a Queensland Lutheran pastor and educator; Carl Krichauff, a Lutheran teacher and journalist; Wilhelm Peters, the founder of Concordia College in Adelaide; Georg Leidig, the founder of Immanuel College in Adelaide. The main themes pertaining to Lutheran schooling which the thesis explores are: relations between church and state; relations between schools and the church; schools adjusting to mainstream educational realities; preservation of distinctive traits; regional contrasts; teacher formation and educational standards; American influences; German roots. As a thesis this history attempts to establish, by means of a number of biographies and the exploration of various themes, the answer to a basic question: what were the main events, issues, personalities and forces which impinged on Lutheran schooling in its first eighty years in Australia and how did they contribute to its unique character?</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">german settlement, lutheran church, lutheran schooling, patriarchs, state aid, teacher training, deutschtum, educational standards</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Ore Breakage Characterization for AG/SAG Mill Modelling</field><field name="creator">Stephen Larbi-Bram</field><field name="description">Abstract In the existing JKMRC breakage testing method for AG/SAG mill modelling, ore is characterised using mainly high energy single impact tests. However, recent DEM studies have suggested that breakage in AG/SAG mills is mainly due to low energy repetitive (or multiple) collisions rather than single high energy impacts. Furthermore, several of the published AG/SAG ore hardness tests developed outside the JKMRC use laboratory tumbling mills to quantify the specific power required to grind the ore to a set product size. Comprehensive experiments were carefully designed using two mill diameters of 1.1 and 0.6 m to mimic the reported low energy repetitive impact breakage under low load conditions. The ore breakage characterisation parameters derived from high energy single impact tests were used to predict the low energy repetitive impact breakage behaviour. Significant bias has been shown to be associated with the traditional high energy single impact characterisation approach, suggesting an alternative method was required. An extensive experimental program with more than 1400 tests was conducted using a newly developed JKRBT (JKMRC Rotary Breakage Tester) device, gravity drop test and laboratory tumbling mills. Comprehensive data were collected and analysed to provide an understanding of low energy repetitive impact breakage of particles and high energy single impact breakage. Details of the experimental study and findings are presented in Chapter 5. A breakage characterisation model has been developed, which takes into account the various impact energy classes and their associated body breakage and surface breakage responses. The breakage conditions were analysed and used to derive two sets of impact breakage parameters (body breakage and surface breakage). These parameters were then combined using a procedure believed to account for the two key breakage modes in tumbling, and successfully applied to predict the breakage in the two laboratory tumbling mills. Chapter 6 presents the breakage modelling approach and results. Based on the understanding of different breakage modes, a novel particle breakage characterisation method for AG/SAG mill modelling has been proposed and validated. Different from the prior-art JKMRC approach in which the breakage tests are conducted at high energy single impact, the proposed method incorporates high energy single impact, low energy multiple impacts and a simplified tumbling test. Both breakage probability and degree of breakage are used to characterise the breakage behaviour of ores. The details of the new characterisation method can be found in Chapter 7. The studies conclude that &#8226; The JKRBT can be used to investigate rock breakage characteristics under single and repetitive impacts; &#8226; The breakage of rocks in tumbling mills (under very low load conditions) can be likened to the low energy JKRBT repetitive impact breakage. &#8226; The behaviour of particle breakage as observed in AG/SAG milling can be modelled using a combination of JKRBT and tumbling ore breakage characterization; &#8226; A methodology for ore breakage characterization for AG/SAG mill modelling has been proposed and validated using independent sets of ores samples.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">04 Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">ore breakage characterization, breakage probability, degree of breakage, body breakage, surface breakage, minimum energy threshold, repetitive impacts, single impact</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimum Polarization States &amp; their Role in UWB Radar Identification of Targets</field><field name="creator">Faisal Aldhubaib</field><field name="description">Although utilization of polarimetry techniques for recognition of military and civilian targets is well established in the narrowband context, it is not yet fully established in a broadband sense as compared to planetary area of research. The concept of combining polarimetry together with certain areas of broadband technology and thus forming a robust signature and feature set has been the main theme of this thesis. This is important, as basing the feature set on multiple types of signatures can increase the accuracy of the recognition process. In this thesis, the concept of radar target recognition based upon a polarization signature in a broadband context is examined. A proper UWB radar signal can excite the target dominant resonances and, consequently, reveal information about the target principle dimensions; while diversity in the polarization domain revealed information about the target shape. The target dimensions are used to classify the target, and then information about its shape is used to identify it. Fused together and inferred from the target characteristic polarization states, it was verified that the polarization information at dominant resonant frequencies have both a physical interpretation and attributes (as seen in section &#8206;3.4.3) related to the target symmetry, linearity, and orientation. In addition, this type of information has the ability to detect the presence of major scattering mechanisms such as strong specular reflection as in the case of the cylinder flat ends. Throughout the thesis, simulated canonical targets with similar resonant frequencies were used, and thus identification of radar targets was based solely on polarization information. In this framework, the resonant frequencies were merely identified as peaks in the frequency response for simple or low damping targets such as thin metal wires, or alternatively identified as the imaginary parts of the complex poles for complex or high damping targets with significant diameter and dielectric properties. Therefore, the main contribution of this thesis originates from the ability to integrate the optimum polarization states in a broadband context for improved target recognition performance. In this context, the spectral dispersion originating from the broad nature of the radar signal, the lack of accuracy in extracting the target resonances, the robustness of the polarization feature set, the representation of these states in time domain, and the feature set modelling with spatial variation are among the important issues addressed with several approaches presented to overcome them. The general approach considered involved a subset of &#8220;representative&#8221; times in the time domain, or correspondingly, &#8220;representative frequencies&#8221; in the frequency domain with which to associate optimum polarization states with each member of the subset are used. The first approach in chapter &#8206;3 involved the polarization representation by a set of frequency bands associated with the target resonant frequencies. This type of polarization description involved the formulation of a wideband scattering matrix to accommodate the broad nature of the signal presentation with appropriate bandwidth selection for each resonance; good estimation of the optimum polarization states in this procedure was achievable even for low signal-to-noise ratios. The second approach in chapter &#8206;4 extended the work of chapter &#8206;3 and involved the modification of the optimum polarization states by their associated powers. In addition, this approach included an identification algorithm based on the nearest neighbour technique. To identify the target, the identification algorithm involved the states at a set of resonant frequencies to give a majority vote. Then, a comparison of the performance of the modified polarization states and the original states demonstrated good improvement when the modified set is used. Generally, the accuracy of the resonance set estimate is more reliable in the time domain than the frequency domain, especially for resonances well localized in time. Therefore, the third approach in chapter &#8206;5 deals with the optimum states in the time domain where the extension to a wide band context was possible by the virtue of the polarization information embodied in the energy of the resonances. This procedure used a model-based signature to model the target impulse response as a set of resonances. The relevant resonance parameters, in this case, the resonant frequency and its associated energy, were extracted using the Matrix Pencil of Function algorithm. Again, this approach of sparse representation is necessary to find descriptors from the target impulse response that are time-invariant, and at the same time, can relate robustly to the target physical characteristics. A simple target such as a long wire showed that indeed polarization information contained in the target resonance energies could reflect the target physical attributes. In addition, for noise-corrupted signals and without any pulse averaging, the accuracy in estimating the optimum states was sufficiently good for signal to noise ratios above 20dB. Below this level, extraction of some members of the resonance set are not possible. In addition, using more complex wire models of aircraft, these time-based optimum states could distinguish between similar dimensional targets with small structural differences, e.g. different wing dihedral angles. The results also showed that the dominant resonance set has members belonging to different structural sections of the target. Therefore, incorporation of a time-based polarization set can give the full target physical characteristics. In the final procedure, a statistical Kernel function estimated the feature set derived previously in chapter &#8206;3, with aspect angle. After sampling the feature set over a wide set of angular aspects, a criterion based on the Bayesian error bisected the target global aspect into smaller sectors to decrease the variance of the estimate and, subsequently, decrease the probability of error. In doing so, discriminative features that have acceptable minimum probability of error were achievable. The minimum probability of error criterion and the angular bisection of the target could separate the feature set of two targets with similar resonances.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automatic Target recognition,</field><field name="subject">Kernel Statistical Analysis</field><field name="subject">feature selection</field><field name="subject">nearest neighbour</field><field name="subject">target feature</field><field name="subject">resonance theory</field><field name="subject">characteristic polarization state theory</field><field name="subject">Radar polarimetry</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199878</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Faith or evidence: does ideology shape service delivery in the non-government alcohol and other drugs sector?</field><field name="creator">Fairlie McIlwraith</field><field name="description">Abstract Background People with alcohol and other drug (AOD) problems are offered treatment by a variety of organisations in the non-government sector, many of which have religious affiliations. Little is known about the actual treatment offered, and whether the ideology of the organisation has an impact on the choice of treatment provided. Christian churches were amongst the first service-delivery organisations in the Australian AOD sector, and those remaining in the sector appear to have evolved from providing overt Christian-care to providing some evidence-based care in line with the move to best practice under Australia&#8217;s National Drug Strategy. It remains to be determined, however, whether the approach to treatment and service provision by religiously-affiliated agencies is influenced by their religious background and orientation. To resolve this gap in knowledge a national survey of non-government AOD agencies was conducted in late 2005&#8211;early 2006. Methods Survey participants consisted of all identified non-government AOD agencies in Australia. The operational definition of AOD agencies was in keeping with definitions used in other investigations in the sector. The sample frame was compiled using the most recent directories and databases available. Two questionnaires were posted to 331 agencies throughout Australia. Responses were sought from both the director/coordinator and a staff member working directly with clients. Completed questionnaires were received from 169 (51 per cent) of agencies. A completed questionnaire from both the director/coordinator and an AOD worker was received from 90 of these 169 agencies. Where this was the case, the response from the director/coordinator was taken to be the &#8216;agency response&#8217;. Questions were about the agency&#8217;s profile, goals, activities, the respondent&#8217;s own view of substance dependence and the respondent&#8217;s demographic characteristics. Qualitative methods were also used to gain further information and clarification from key informants, both prior to and after the quantitative survey. Findings There was surprising homogeneity amongst all agencies in their use of the eight treatment orientations studied (12-step, therapeutic community, cognitive behaviour, psychodynamic, rehabilitation, dual diagnosis, medical, and family). Cognitive behaviour therapy was the most popular treatment across all types of agencies in contrast to the 12-step approach which was only a major focus for a small number of agencies. Psychodynamic and therapeutic community orientations were also widely used but family and rehabilitation orientations were amongst the least popular orientations. With the family orientation there was a wide discrepancy between agencies that had family goals but not family activities. In regard to accessing treatment, mothers accompanied by their children and couples were the two groups least likely to be accepted into treatment (44 per cent and 40 per cent respectively did not accept couples). Directors interviewed in this study indicated that not accepting mothers accompanied by their children was due to the cost of providing relevant services. Of the agencies surveyed, 42 per cent were affiliated with a church organisation. Although 85 per cent of church-affiliated agencies indicated that they received some contribution towards policy from a religious organisation, results suggested that there was very little difference between church-affiliated and non-church-affiliated agencies in service delivery. One area of significant difference between church-affiliated and non-church-affiliated agencies was access. Church-affiliated agencies were significantly more likely than non-church-affiliated agencies to not accept couples, Indigenous people, and people referred from the criminal justice system. Church-affiliated agencies were also significantly more likely to take into consideration a prospective client&#8217;s motivation to succeed. Across all agencies activities of a spiritual nature (e.g. meditation/prayer, talking with clients about spirituality/religion) were only a major feature for a small number of agencies; although 70 per cent of agencies included developing a client&#8217;s spiritual self in their goals. The majority of directors/coordinators indicated that they have a broad set of beliefs about substance use that allows for various social and psychological understandings and treatment responses. Conclusion Overall, there was uniformity in the type of treatment goals and activities offered by the non-government AOD agencies. The findings suggest that churches are becoming indistinguishable from secular organisations in their delivery of AOD services. Where once there may have been faith in religion as a basis of service provision there now appears to be faith in science. This is in the context that the &#8216;best evidence&#8217; of effective treatments suggests that most treatments are relatively weak predictors of a positive outcome, and that the choice of treatment may not impact on treatment outcomes. The evidence-based medicine movement may have become a form of religion and, in association with a population health approach, is dominating the AOD service delivery sector. Although successful drug treatment programs may well require that the client/patient undergo moral and value changes, these may occur without connection to organised religion. Ideology in the form of religious belief has historically played a central role in treatment choices and it continues to do so in the form of an ideology giving priority to best practice, despite the likelihood that best practice may nevertheless continue to produce poor outcomes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol and other drugs, treatment, ideology, religion, evidence-based medicine, best practice</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect on bacterial biofilms of endoscopic sinus surgery and long term low-dose macrolide antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis</field><field name="creator">Vu Thanh Hai Phan</field><field name="description">Abstract: The role of bacterial biofilms in patients with persistent CRS is of growing concern. The limited efficacy of some medical and surgical treatments for CRS illustrates the need for further progress in this area. The current treatments of chronic rhinosinusitis are concentrated on medical +/- surgical therapy. In this thesis, we consider two methods performed in chronic rhinosinusitis, endoscopic sinus surgery and long term low-dose macrolide therapy, and consider how they can affect bacterial biofilms. The effect of endoscopic sinus surgery on bacterial biofilms and the clinical impact of this condition on CRS patients may be far more profound than we can currently understand. To understand the impact of ESS on bacterial biofilms, we have performed the first prospective study to evaluate the effect of ESS on bacterial biofilms in patients with CRS and patients&#8217; clinical outcomes after 3 months follow-up. We have shown that ESS results in a statistically significant improvement in QoL, subjective and objective outcome measures. In terms of bacterial biofilms, the mean OD630nm of isolates was significantly reduced after 3 months follow-up (p=0.043). No correlations between the reduction of bacterial biofilms with any of the objective, subjective and QoL outcomes were seen in our study. Macrolides have demonstrated their anti-inflamatory effects in the treatment of diffuse panbronchiolitis, asthma, cystis fibrosis and chronic rhinosinusitis. In recent years, there are a number of in vitro studies supporting the anti-biofilm effects of macrolide antibiotics, especially at sub-MICs level. These have shown that macrolides alter the outer membrane, lipopolysaccharide of biomass and inhibit the expression of other bacterial virulence factors which may disrupt the adherence of bacteria to form biofilms. Long term low dose macrolide therapy, therefore, may transform bacterial biofilms from the protected organized form into the plantonic form. In this thesis, we also report the first in vivo efficacy of long term low dose macrolides on bacterial biofilms in patients with CRS. Patients receiving oral macrolide showed significant improvements in subjective, objective and QoL scores following a 12 week course. Nasal swabs were taken from CRS patients at the first visit and 3 months after macrolide therapy. Using the microtiter biofilm assay, these swabs showed a reduction in the mean OD630nm of isolates in 8/12 patients. While it is well-known that bacterial biofilms are established in CRS patients, the relationship between the improvement of clinical symptoms and the severity of bacterial biofilm is less clear.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chronic rhinosinusitis, bacterial biofilms, macolides, endoscopic sinus surgery, clarithromycin, crystal violet staining</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:199968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic Risk Factors in Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</field><field name="creator">Daniel Buchanan</field><field name="description">Background: Parkinson&#8217;s disease (PD) is a complex disease with a multi-factorial aetiology, comprising both genetic and environmental risk factors. The disease pathology is progressive and neurodegenerative where dopaminergic nerve cell death occurs predominantly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) with the subsequent loss of the dopamine neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia. The most significant risk factors for PD include an advancing age and a family history of the disease, while environmental and lifestyle risk factors such as pesticide exposure and smoking are widely accepted as risk altering exposures. Currently up to 10% of PD is attributed to Mendelian inherited PD at one of 13 PARK loci in 9 genes. The pursuit of common susceptibility alleles for idiopathic PD has proven challenging with only a few loci reproducibility associated with an altered risk. The aim of this thesis is to study, using a candidate gene case-control design, the potential role of genetic variants in PD. The APOE candidate gene was hypothesized to modify the risk of PD as it is a proven modifier of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD). The common pathological finding in PD of elevated levels of iron within the SNpc is proposed to increase the oxidative state of the nerve cells and predispose the dopaminergic neurons to apoptosis. Therefore, susceptibility alleles within the candidate genes that regulate iron metabolism and homeostasis are hypothesized to alter iron metabolism and predispose to iron-induced neurodegeneration in PD. Missense variants and common &#8220;tagging&#8221; SNPs with the HFE, Transferrin and Transferrin Receptor genes are investigated extensively in this thesis. Finally, autosomal recessively inherited PD can result from mutations in the parkin gene at the PARK2 locus. The final hypothesis explored in this thesis suggests that non-deleterious missense variants in the parkin gene modify the risk for developing sporadic PD. Further genetic variation in the parkin gene such as exon rearrangements is a frequently reported mutation where heterozygosity for these rearrangements may increase the risk of PD. Heterozygous deletions or duplications of exons in the parkin gene provide technical challenges for their detection. In this thesis a novel assay for the detection of these mutations is investigated. Methods: Genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP for genetic variants in the APOE (E2 and E4 alleles), HFE (C282Y, H63D and S65C), Transferrin receptor (TfR; S142G), Transferrin (Tfn; P570S and G258S), IREB2 genes (L159V) and the parkin gene (S167N, R366W and V380L) in a cohort of 425 PD cases and 387 controls recruited from throughout Queensland, Australia. A tagged SNP high-throughput genotyping approach was then employed to try to replicate single SNP associations in 6 iron-related genes using a cohort of 1034 PD cases and 774 controls. These genetic variants were analysed for direct association with PD risk, age of onset effects as well as potential gene x gene (GxG) and gene x environment (GxE) interactions. Additionally, a quantitative PCR assay was developed to detect heterozygous deletions and duplications within the parkin gene and utilised to screen 43 YOPD cases for these mutations. Results: The initial study of the HFE C282Y variant revealed a significant protective association with PD in the two independent cohorts studied. Further study did not reveal significant associations with PD for the other HFE variants or missense variants within the Tfn and TfR genes. When analysed for GxE interactions, the C282Y, P589S and G277S variants showed evidence for an increased risk of PD in synergy with pesticide and herbicide exposure. Carriers of the risk variant and with toxin exposure were at two-fold increased risk of PD, although the number of individuals in this category was small. A further investigation of the role of common genetic polymorphisms in iron genes revealed only one of the 20 SNPs genotyped using high-throughput multiplex methods, remained significantly associated with PD after correction for age and sex. The rs198855 SNP is downstream of the HFE gene and further implicates a role for HFE in PD. The APOE E4 allele demonstrated modifying effects for the age of PD onset, restricted to the female cases. Analysis of the parkin missense variants also demonstrated a modifying effect on the age of PD onset in carriers of the S167N variant, with putative interactions between the APOE E4 allele, a family history of PD and toxin exposure that further reduced the age of onset. Twenty individuals of the 43 YOPD cases screened demonstrated heterozygous parkin exon rearrangements using the novel qPCR method. Conclusions: Non-synonymous variants within iron-related genes or the parkin gene putatively interact with herbicide and pesticide exposure to increase the risk of PD or modify the phenotype, highlighting the need for future studies to address the multi-factorial aetiology of PD in their study design and analysis. This thesis provides evidence for the association between genetic variation within the HFE locus and PD and for the APOE E4 allele as a modifier of PD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parkinson&#8217;s disease, genetics, iron, parkin, apoe, case-control study, snps, missense variants, exon rearrangements, gene-environment interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Competition and regulation in the taxi industry</field><field name="creator">Gole, Tom</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Speed Variation on Wear-Type Rail Corrugation Formation and Growth</field><field name="creator">Paul Bellette</field><field name="description">Rail corrugation is a periodic wear pattern that develops on the wheel and rail contacting surfaces in railway systems. It is a commonly observed phenomenon worldwide and is a serious problem because it causes degradation of the track and its components and is a significant source of noise. Currently the only reliable method of ameliorating the negative effects of rail corrugation is to periodically regrind the rail surface to a smooth profile, at great expense to the railway operator. It is therefore of interest to investigate other possible control strategies to reduce corrugation growth through an understanding of the mechanism of corrugation formation. This thesis presents an investigation into the effect of speed variation on the corrugation formation mechanism. The research presented is intended to highlight the significant role that speed variation has on corrugation formation via a disruption of the feedback mechanism which leads to corrugation growth over successive train passages. This discovery motivates the investigation the feasibility of altered speed variation as a novel corrugation control method, due to the large effect that the variance of train speed has on corrugation growth rates. The effect of variable pass speed on corrugation formation has been investigated in this thesis through the use of efficient models of corrugation formation in straight track and cornering conditions. These models are simple enough to readily perform corrugation control studies without neglecting any relevant physics, obscuring the corrugation formation mechanism with overly detailed modelling or imposing a significant computational burden on performing control studies. These novel models have been outlined and their predictions elucidated in detail. A theoretical investigation into the effect of speed variation in the presence of a resonance free mechanism for corrugation growth via a contact filter has been performed and shown to only be important when the dynamic wavelength of formation approaches the size of the contact patch. The results of these corrugation models have been validated via test rig and field experiments. An investigation of the effectiveness of speed variation as a corrugation growth control measure has also been investigated via test rig experiments. The results of this thesis have formed the basis of an industry supported field trail of this technique for corrugation mitigation that is currently in progress.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rail corrugation</field><field name="subject">Speed Variation</field><field name="subject">Contact Mechanics</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">Friction Modifiers</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Snore Sound Pitch and Total Airway Response in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Detection</field><field name="creator">Asela S Karunajeewa</field><field name="description">Obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is a highly prevalent disease in which upper airways are collapsed during sleep, leading to serious consequences. The reference standard of clinical diagnosis, called Polysomnography (PSG), requires a full-night hospital stay connected to over 15 measuring channels requiring physical contact with sensors. The vast quantity of physiological data acquired during the PSG has to be manually scored by a qualified technologist to assess the presence or absence of the decease. The PSG is inconvenient, time consuming, expensive and unsuited for community screening. The limited PSG facilities around the world have resulted in long waiting lists and a large fraction of patients remain undiagnosed at present. There has been a flurry of recent activities in developing a portable technology to resolve this need. All the devices have at least one sensor that requires physical contact with the subject. Unattended systems have not led to sufficiently high sensitivity/specificity levels to be used in a routine home monitoring or a community screening exercise. OSAHS is a sleep respiratory disorder principally caused by functional deficiencies occurring in the upper airways during sleep. These conditions and the reduced muscle tone during sleep, cause the muscles in the upper airways to collapse partially or completely thus resulting in episodes of hypopnoea and apnoea respectively. During the process leading to collapse of upper airways, upper airways act as an acoustic filter frequently producing snoring sounds. The process of snore sound production leads us to hypothesise that snore sounds should contain information on changes occurring in the upper airways during the OSAHS. Snoring almost always accompanies the OSAHS and is universally recognised as its earliest symptom. At present, however, the quantitative analysis of snore sounds is not a practice in clinical OSAHS detection. The vast potential of snoring in the diagnosis/screening of the OSAHS remains unused. Snoring-based technology opens up opportunities for building community-screening devices that do not depend on contact instrumentation. In this thesis, we present our work towards developing a snore&#8211;based non-contact instrumentation for the diagnosis/screening of the OSAHS. The primary task in the analysis of Snore Related Sounds (SRS) would be to segment the SRS data as accurately as possible into three main classes, snoring (voiced non-silence), breathing (unvoiced non-silence) and silence. A new algorithm was developed, based on pattern recognition for the SRS segmentation. Four features derived from the SRS were considered to classify samples of the SRS into three classes. We also investigated the performance of the algorithm with three commonly-used noise reduction (NR) techniques in speech processing, Amplitude Spectral Subtraction (ASS), Power Spectral Subtraction (PSS) and Short Time Spectral Amplitude (STSA) Estimation. It was found that the noise reduction, together with a proper choice of features, could improve the classification accuracy to 96.78%. A novel model for the SRS was proposed for the response of a mixed-phase system (total airways response, TAR) to a source excitation at the input. The TAR/source model is similar to the vocal tract/source model in speech synthesis and is capable of capturing the acoustical changes brought about by the collapsing upper airways in the OSAHS. An algorithm was developed, based on the higher-order-spectra (HOS) to jointly estimate the source and the TAR, preserving the true phase characteristics of the latter. Working on a clinical database of signals, we show that the TAR is indeed a mixed phased signal and second-order statistics cannot fully characterise it. Nocturnal speech sounds can corrupt snore recordings and pose a challenge to the snore-based OSAHS diagnosis. The TAR could be shown to detect speech segments embedded in snores and derive features to diagnose the OSAHS. Finally presented is a novel technique for diagnosing the OSAHS, based solely on multi-parametric snore sound analysis. The method comprises a logistic regression model fed with a range of snore parameters derived from its features &#8212; the pitch and Total Airways Response (TAR) estimated using a Higher Order Statistics (HOS) based algorithm. The model was developed and its performance validated on a clinical database consisting of overnight snoring sounds simultaneously recorded during a hospital PSG using a high fidelity sound recording setup. The K-fold cross validation technique was used for validating the model. The validation process achieved an 89.3% sensitivity with 92.3% specificity (the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96) in classifying the data sets into the two groups, the OSAHS (AHI &gt;10) and the non-OSAHS. These results are superior to the existing results and unequivocally illustrate the feasibility of developing a snore-based non-contact OSAHS screening device.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">10 Technology</field><field name="subject">Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Hypopnoea Syndrome, Snore-related Sounds, Class Classification, Higher-order Statistics, Total Airways Response, Pitch, Multi-parametric, Logistic Regression Model, Community Screening</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anti-pronation tape: Initial effects on neuromotor control of gait, foot posture and foot mobility and the influence of continual use</field><field name="creator">Melinda Franettovich</field><field name="description">Anti-pronation taping is commonly used by clinicians in the management of lower limb musculoskeletal pain and injury. Despite its frequent use in the clinical setting the mechanism(s) underlying its efficacy is not completely understood. For example, there is evidence that anti-pronation taping produces a biomechanical effect, but there has been little investigation of other mechanisms such as neurophysiological or psychological effects. Additionally, studies to date have been performed in mostly asymptomatic populations and have focused on the initial effect of tape (i.e. immediately following application and through a short duration of activity). Improved understanding of the underlying physiological mechanism(s) of anti-pronation tape is likely to facilitate improved knowledge of the technique, which may optimise its clinical application and contribute to clinical selection guidelines. The aims of this thesis were developed to address several of the limitations in the current anti-pronation taping literature. To facilitate an investigation of the comparative initial physiological effect of anti-pronation tape in a symptomatic and asymptomatic population, the first aim of this thesis was to compare neuromotor control (control of muscle activation and movement patterns) of gait, foot posture and foot mobility between asymptomatic individuals and individuals with a history of exercise related leg pain. The second aim of this thesis was to investigate the initial physiological effects of anti-pronation tape, specifically its neurophysiological (i.e. effect on muscle activation patterns) and biomechanical (i.e. effect on movement patterns, foot posture, foot mobility) effects. Thirdly this thesis aimed to investigate the duration of these initial physiological effects following tape removal. The fourth and fifth aims were to investigate the long term biomechanical and neurophysiological effects of anti-pronation taping i.e. following continual use over a clinically relevant period. In the first instance our aim was to investigate the effect of continual use on neuromotor control of gait, foot posture and foot mobility, and secondly to investigate the effect of continual use on the technique&#8217;s initial neurophysiological and biomechanical effects. Individuals with exercise related leg pain demonstrated lower activation of gluteus medius and lateral gastrocnemius during gait, but we observed no differences in lower limb movement patterns or foot posture and foot mobility between the two groups. The initial effect of tape was similar in individuals with and without exercise related leg pain. Specifically application of tape produced a reduction in activation of tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior and medial gastrocnemius, and increased activation of peroneus longus. There was a reduction in foot mobility, ankle plantarflexion and abduction excursion and an increase in ankle dorsiflexion and adduction excursion. Reduced muscle activation and increased motion was also observed at more proximal segments (knee, hip, pelvis), but were of smaller magnitude than at the foot and ankle. Changes in foot mobility, ankle kinematics and leg muscle activity did not continue following the removal of tape, but at more proximal segments (i.e. pelvis, hip and knee) small changes in kinematics and muscle activity were observed following the removal of tape. In regards to long term effects, continual use of tape for approximately 12 days produced a small increase in arch height when compared to a control. We did not observe a change in muscle activation or motion patterns, nor did continual use of the technique influence its initial neurophysiological or biomechanical effects (i.e. reduction in muscle activity, reduction in foot mobility, altered lower limb motion). The studies from this thesis provide evidence that anti-pronation tape should be considered in the management of individuals where reduced midfoot mobility, control of ankle motion or reduced activation of the leg muscles is desired, regardless of symptomatic status. When applied for approximately 12 days, anti-pronation tape produced a small increase in arch height ratio, but no alteration in neuromotor control. We are not aware of any definitive data on what constitutes a clinically meaningful increase in arch height, but results from a published case series suggests that our findings of a small increase in arch height may be clinically relevant for the treatment of lower extremity overuse injuries. Continual use of tape for a clinically relevant period does not alter its initial effects on foot posture and mobility or neuromotor control during gait. It would appear that the initial effects of anti-pronation tape are robust even after continuous use over a period of 11 days.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lower Limb</field><field name="subject">Musculoskeletal</field><field name="subject">Electromyography</field><field name="subject">Kinematics</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Gait analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formulation of Peptide Surfactant-Stabilised Emulsions for siRNA Delivery</field><field name="creator">Kaiyin Hu</field><field name="description">Abstract Peptide surfactants developed in the Centre for Biomolecular Engineering at The University of Queensland are engineered to combine the advantages of traditional surfactants with biodegradability, biocompatibility, formation of a mechanically strong interfacial cohesive network, and reversible stimuli-responsiveness.

In recent years, the potential of siRNA as a new class of therapeutics has attracted great attention. The ubiquitous nature of RNA interference (RNAi) implies that siRNA can be used to silence any disease-causing gene to treat any disease. The hurdle that needs to be overcome to turn siRNA therapy into clinical reality is its delivery into the cytosol, where gene silencing by siRNA occurs. Although numerous systems have been developed for the delivery of siRNA, safety and efficiency are major concerns associated with current formulations. Therefore this project aimed to prepare a stable peptide emulsion formulation and to conduct initial tests of its ability to deliver siRNA in vitro. The human tumour suppressor gene p53 and the human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line were used as the model gene and model cell line, respectively. The commercially available lipid-based transfection reagent Lipofectamine&#8482; 2000 was used as the benchmark control. Sonication and membrane extrusion were used to formulate emulsions with droplet size (&#63717;d=120 nm) suitable for intravenous applications using peptide surfactant in the presence of Zn(II). Although these peptide emulsions are stable by themselves and in bovine serum, emulsion stability was found to be strongly affected by the presence of salt, EDTA, and proteins. The instability of AM1 emulsion in cell culture media has been a concern when it was subjected to in vitro cell culture tests. AM1-stabilised emulsion droplets were shown to be taken up by MCF-7 cells. However, siRNA when coupled with AM1 emulsion was not delivered into cells. Cytotoxicity studies showed that peptide surfactants did not exhibit high-level toxicity to CHO cells at the tested concentrations (0.25-2 mg mL-1). AM1 peptide-stabilised emulsions were mildly toxic to CHO cells but no toxicity was observed with MCF-7 cells. Future work could include evaluation of peptide emulsion-siRNA complex formation, and exploring the effects of different cell culture media compositions on emulsion stability and their relation to cytotoxicity.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peptide, surfactant, emulsion, siRNA, drug delivery, p53, MCF-7, formulation,cytotoxicity, Lipofectamine&#8482; 2000, transfection.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and Environmental Risk Assessment of Metals and Metalloids Related to Mining Activities at Wainivesi,Fiji</field><field name="creator">Raijieli Taga</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Risk assessment, bioavailability, exposure pathways, mining impacts, heavy metals, arsenic, toxicity, bioaccessibility</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plants, pests and pollinators: Combining technologies to crack the odour code</field><field name="creator">Emily McCallum</field><field name="description">Terpenes are important specialised metabolites produced by all organisms. Plants produce the greatest diversity of terpenoid compounds, which function in a variety of crucial processes including regulation of growth and development, energy production and plant-insect communication, including pollinator attraction and prevention of herbivore damage. Isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), the building block for all terpenoid compounds, is synthesised in plants via two unique terpene synthesis pathways located in the plastids and the cytosol, and the regulation of these pathways is still not well understood. The aim of this research was to (1) modify and study the regulation of floral volatile production in Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) by altering the expression of various enzymes in the terpene biosynthesis pathway and (2) determine the role of specific volatile compounds in floral odour blends in feeding and oviposition behaviours of Helicoverpa armigera, a polyphagous moth of widespread agricultural importance. Expression levels of several enzymes in the terpene biosynthetic pathway were altered by genetic modification in order to modify terpene volatile emissions produced by flowers of N. tabacum. Genes chosen for overexpression were cloned from several species and RNAi hairpins were constructed from gene fragments amplified from tobacco flower cDNA. Transgenic plants were produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and lines with high levels of transgene expression selected for analysis. The flower-specific Antirrhinum majus chalcone synthase promoter was chosen to control gene expression in transgenic lines in order to avoid the potentially deleterious effects of widespread disruption to terpene biosynthesis. Floral volatiles were sampled using two methods; solid phase microextraction, a highly sensitive technique able to detect even trace levels of volatile compounds in headspace samples, and Tenax sampling, a robust and replicable method to quantify volatile emissions. All floral headspace samples were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Floral volatile analysis determined that wild type Ti68 tobacco flowers emit a simple blend of floral volatiles, with only linalool, a monoterpene, and &#946;-caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene, detected by both sampling methods. Volatile emissions were not subject to temporal regulation, but changes in the floral odour blend were detected during flower development. Overexpression of the plastidic terpene biosynthesis genes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and geranyl diphosphate synthase did not affect volatile production, however increased farnesyl diphosphate synthase expression in the cytosol surprisingly caused an increase in linalool emissions, synthesised in the plastids. Downregulation of DXR resulted in an albino phenotype affecting all young leaves, the upper stem and the sepals in the most severely affected lines. A significant three-fold decrease in floral linalool emissions, and a nine-fold reduction of both linalool and &#946;-caryophyllene retained within floral tissues was observed in the transgenic lines. In feeding behaviour tests, male and virgin female H. armigera moths did not discriminate between wild type and DXR knockdown flowers at close-range, despite the significant difference in linalool emissions. Expression of an (E)-&#946;-ocimene synthase gene controlled by the CHS promoter did not result in any transgenic plants emitting the novel monoterpene, (E)-&#946;-ocimene. Significant problems with seed germination suggested that (E)-&#946;-ocimene may cause embryo lethality in these lines. However, overexpression of a heterologous (S)-linalool synthase under control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter resulted in a significant two-fold increase in volatile linalool, and &#946;-glycosidase assays confirmed sequestration of a glycosylated linalool derivative in floral tissues. Oviposition preference tests with mated female H. armigera moths indicated a significant preference for egg-laying on wild type flowers compared to flowers with increased linalool production. The results of this research, and previous studies of volatile production in transgenic tobacco, indicate that IPP precursor exchange occurs predominantly in one direction from the cytosol to the plastids, at least under the stress caused by alterations in pathway flux. Regulation of the cytosolic terpene biosynthetic pathway upstream of IPP synthesis appears to be less strictly controlled than the plastidic pathway. Insect behavioural assays support the findings of recent studies in other moth species, and suggest that close-range feeding attraction of H. armigera may be more strongly influenced by visual cues, whereas odour cues, including contact chemoreception, play a more important role in oviposition preferences. The increase in knowledge of the olfactory contribution toward insect-plant communication demonstrated here, and from future work, will lead to improved management of pest species in agricultural and ecological settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nicotiana tabacum</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">transgenic</field><field name="subject">terpenes</field><field name="subject">floral volatiles</field><field name="subject">linalool</field><field name="subject">insect-plant communication</field><field name="subject">Helicoverpa armigera</field><field name="subject">pollination</field><field name="subject">oviposition</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tourism Education and Local Employment as Factors Contributing to the Sustainable Development of Tourism in SIDS: The Case of the Maldives</field><field name="creator">Aishath Shakeela</field><field name="description">Due to the numerous developmental constraints that they face, often Small Island Developing States (SIDS) relies on tourism as the means by which to achieve development. As such, SIDS governments promote sustainable tourism in policy agendas on the grounds that it will enhance the lives of local people through the creation of employment and subsequent increase in income level. However, often in SIDS, sustainable tourism development largely focuses on the management of resources and the impacts associated with tourism development. In this regard the focus on tourism development has remained on developing the necessary infrastructure for attracting international tourist markets, neglecting the crucial components of tourism education and local employment. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the role of tourism education and local employment as factors contributing to the sustainable development of tourism in the context of a SIDS destination. The context of the Maldives was selected as the SIDS case. This research indicated that in aggressive pursuit of increasing the number of international arrivals and with an &#8216;expansionist&#8217; attitude, the SIDS case under study has neglected the crucial aspects of tourism education and local employment as contributors to the sustainable development of tourism. Consequently, tourism education neither meets the local needs for employment nor the industry needs for a skilled and educated workforce. The research revealed that this is an outcome of insufficient attention being given at policy level to tourism education, and local employment. Indeed, the research revealed that an increase in the number of international tourist arrivals and subsequent increase in foreign exchange earnings does not necessary mean that tourism brings economic sustainability to the destination by providing employment opportunities to the local communities and increased income. The research further revealed the complexity of issues which affect local participation in tourism. Moreover, the research also indicated how sustainable tourism development is intrinsically linked to tourism education and local employment. As the SIDS governments have a catalytic role to play in ensuring that tourism is developed in a sustainable manner that benefits all stakeholders, instead of implementing piecemeal policies in tourism education and local employment, this study advocates the integration of tourism education and local employment policies as part of the broader national development plan. This thesis contributes to tourism policy and practice. From a theoretical perspective, this research adds to the body of knowledge relating to the study of sustainable development of tourism in the context of a SIDS destination. Further, this research presents a number of practical recommendations for the government and the industry to ensure that tourism is indeed developed on a sustainable manner that benefits all stakeholders.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local employment</field><field name="subject">tourism education</field><field name="subject">human resource</field><field name="subject">local participation</field><field name="subject">Sustainable Tourism</field><field name="subject">Maldives</field><field name="subject">SIDS</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature since the mid-1980s: Discourse, History, and Identity</field><field name="creator">Shu-hwa Wu</field><field name="description">In this thesis, Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature from the mid 1980s is the focus of discussion. The material I will cover includes literature in the genre of poetry, prose, fiction and song lyrics. I situate my thesis in the field of literary and cultural studies based on contemporary aboriginal writing. Application of postcolonial-colonial discourse, such as diaspora and articulation, explicates the close relationship between the socio-political context and Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature, in particular, the process of re-construction of aboriginal identity. My thesis develops from the following hypothesis: firstly, the concerns expressed in aboriginal writing are closely tied to social and cultural issues, such as the disruption, or construction of aboriginal heritages, under or after the rule of colonial governments. Secondly, as a result of broader changes in Taiwanese society, writers&#8217; focus and strategies change with their specific social environments. To compare the shared and different characteristics of aboriginal writing and to summarize its development, I examine two periods of Aboriginal Literature and relate them to the internal and external factors pertinent to the writing. Chapter Two and Three contain textual analysis of Aboriginal Literature. Chapter Two &#8220;The Pre-Shanhai Period&#8221; introduces literature by Walis, Hu Defu, Monaneng, Tien Yage and Wenchi. These are works closely related to aboriginal political movements and deal with the disruption of indigenous communities. Chapter Three &#8220;The Shanhai Period&#8221; discusses Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature of the Shanhai Period through the works of Auvini, Lanpoan, and Vava. The findings illustrate the validity of the above hypothesis through discussion on the relationship between theme and period, change of writing position as a result of the social contexts of the time when the writer wrote, and strategies aboriginal authors deploy to reconstruct aboriginal identity. The two periods of literature show changes in aboriginal writers&#8217; speaking positions, that is, as pan-aboriginal speakers, or as tribal speakers, or as individuals. In its first stage of development, Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature was a discourse about survival and about appealing for justice. Writers wrote to make sense of the world in which they live. In writing they asked questions pertinent to their identity: first, &#8220;What does it mean to be born as a Taiwanese Aboriginal, or as one of the Bunun people, or the Atayal people? Writers wrote mainly to counter the perspectives imposed by the colonizers, and to pass on indigenous knowledge. In the second stage of development, Aboriginal Literature reached a period of negotiation and border crossing between indigenous culture and colonial cultures. At this stage, many writers asked: &#8220;What does my traditional culture mean to me in modern society?&#8221; Out of speculation on cultural differences, they wrote to know themselves so as to position themselves in a challenging modern, globalized society. Through this process aboriginal writers attempted to build up aboriginal subjectivity in Taiwanese literature. This study demonstrates that the writing position and strategy of identity construction in Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature shows a development from a literature of resistance to a literature of cultural building and self-examination. It is from the Shanhai period onwards that Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature gradually seeks and forms a literary norm. The literature under study manifests diverse expressions of identity. The writing process further demonstrates a dialogue of aboriginal writers with mainstream society, a constant diasporic process of generating new indigenous subjectivity. As such, the study brings an understanding of Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature to Western readers and scholars to facilitate future studies in this field.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Taiwanese Aboriginal Literature</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese aboriginal writers</field><field name="subject">aboriginal identity</field><field name="subject">Taiwanese Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200877</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of Inflammatory Proteins</field><field name="creator">Maria Halili</field><field name="description">Inflammation involves a complex interplay of immunological responses in reaction to an infection from invading pathogens and to tissue injury. However, if the inflammatory stimulus is not eliminated or if there is an aberrant response, chronic inflammation and disease can result. Most inflammatory diseases are targeted by drugs that provide only symptomatic relief by reducing the associated pain and swelling, without combating the underlying cause and progression of the disease. The purpose of this thesis was to investigate potential drug targets in different sub-cellular compartments to learn more about inflammatory pathways and the consequences of inhibiting them using different classes of small-molecule agents. Chapter 1 is a brief overview of inflammation, outlining differences between acute and chronic inflammation in relation to normal and aberrant immune responses. Major drug classes that are currently in use are briefly discussed, and some potential new inflammatory drug targets in the nucleus, cytoplasm, plasma membrane and serum that are to be investigated in the thesis are described. Chapter 2 addresses histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes that modulate gene transcription, and investigates the regulatory potential of HDACs and their inhibitors in macrophages. Mainly murine macrophages were investigated, but preliminary data on human macrophages is also presented. Four kinds of small-molecule inhibitors of HDAC enzymes are described in relation to their capacity to exhibit pro- or anti- inflammatory gene expression. Broad-spectrum inhibitors, those that do not discriminate between different isoforms of HDACs, were found to induce expression of a number of pro-inflammatory mediators. This was also the case for compounds that selectively inhibit class-I HDACs. On the other hand, compounds that are known to selectively inhibit class-II HDACs did not regulate pro-inflammatory genes and could be classified as anti-inflammatory based on their profiles of gene expression. An inhibitor of class-III HDACs, the sirtuins, was also briefly investigated for anti-inflammatory gene expression. This separation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory responses suggested that specific inhibitors of class II HDACs might be promising for treating inflammatory conditions. Chapters 3 and 4 discuss a group of extracellular serum proteins that are produced through the complement pathway. Complement proteins circulate in plasma while some are formed on membranes through serine protease action, and effect both innate and adaptive immune responses. Chapter 3 deals with the alternative pathway (AP) of complement activation, in particular with the protease Factor B which plays an important role as part of a protein complex (C3 convertase) in the initiation and propagation of complement. Factor B is an inactive zymogen at pH 7, but is catalytically active at alkaline pH. Substrate-based inhibitors were developed for Factor B using a chromogenic assay previously optimised in our lab. Over 60 peptide aldehydes were evaluated, with two potent inhibitors of Factor B studied further, and were found to inhibit C3 convertase by blocking cleavage of the native substrate C3 as measured by SDS-PAGE. Chapter 4 examined the properties of a homologue of Factor B found in the classical pathway (CP), the protease C2. C2 was found herein to be an inactive zymogen at pH 7. Under alkaline conditions C2 cleaved both C3 and short chromogenic peptide substrates. Substrates of 7- or 8-residues, corresponding to those in the native substrate C3, were optimally processed. C2 was inhibited by inhibitors identified in Chapter 3, which also inhibited formation of the different C3 convertase formed through the CP, as well as preventing formation of the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC) as measured by an immobilized ELISA and haemolysis assay. The selectivity of small-molecule peptidic inhibitors for different serine proteases was investigated. Chapter 5 introduces two other unrelated inflammatory proteins which have been incompletely studied herein. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) is a cell surface protein that spans the membrane like other G-protein coupled receptors. PAR-2 has been implicated in inflammatory and proliferative diseased states, though its precise roles are still unclear. Here, PAR-2 mRNA expression was measured for different human cancer and immune cells. In macrophages, PAR-2 mRNA expression was inducible by HDACi, indicating that PAR-2 is negatively regulated by HDAC enzymes. The receptor was present and functional on the surface of HDACi-treated macrophages, permitting evaluation of PAR-2 agonists and antagonists. Caspase-1 is a cytosolic cysteine protease responsible for cleaving proIL-1&#946; and proIL-18 into their active forms that are then secreted from cells as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Using monocytic cells, novel inhibitors of caspase-1 were developed and found to dose-dependently decrease levels of IL-1&#946; released by the cell. Inhibition of caspase-1 may be useful for modulating circulating levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#946;. The investigation of different prospective inflammatory targets in different locations of the cell has provided a lateral overview of inflammatory mechanisms and drug intervention strategies. Specific inhibitors have also been identified for these targets; HDACs in the nucleus, caspase-1 in the cytosol, PAR-2 and MAC on the cell surface, C2 and Factor B and C3 convertase in plasma. This unconventional study of the inflammatory network provides a different viewpoint of inflammatory proteins as drug targets.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">Histone Deacetylase</field><field name="subject">Complement</field><field name="subject">factor b</field><field name="subject">C2</field><field name="subject">protease activated receptor 2</field><field name="subject">caspase 1</field><field name="subject">Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">substrate-based inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Enzymes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201125</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utterances and uptakes: accounts of speech as action and the description of discursive events</field><field name="creator">Andrew Munro</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I ask about the descriptive purchase on discursive events of some accounts of speech as action. To do so, I turn to speech act theory, which I read at first restrictively, and later more broadly, moving from John Langshaw Austin to John Rogers Searle to Judith Butler, appealing along the way to Charles Sanders Peirce, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jean-Fran&#231;ois Lyotard and Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin. In so doing, I construe speech act theory as a genre (or set of genres) of theoretico-critical inquiry. By genre I mean a set of differentiated, recurrent forms of practice which have their own functions or ends, their own means, protocols and postulates: their own speaking positions and objects of representation or inquiry. For my purposes, then, speech act theory denotes a capacious genre of inquiry turning on the topic of speech as action. I take this topic to raise a range of rhetorical issues concerning the pragmatic question of discursive linking. To talk of discursive linking, I suggest, is minimally to presuppose notions of semiosis, of rhetorical situation or occasion and of rhetorical agency, with its attendant postulates of intention and responsibility. I thus read speech act theory rhetorically, as an open set of engagements with the question of how we do things with words: how utterances come to count as action, and how utterance action is described as having determinate consequences and effects. I begin in chapter 1 by reading Austin for his two tensively related, if not countervailing, descriptive tendencies: those of illocution and perlocution. In chapter 2, I attend to Searle as an exemplary development of an illocutionary inquiry, before examining Butler&#8217;s work on hate speech and performativity as a type of perlocutionary inquiry in chapter 3. Illocution and perlocution, I suggest, comprise distinct engagements with the questions of speech as action and discursive linking. Although postulates of semiosis and situation, and figures of responsibility, intention and agency are put to work in both illocutionary and perlocutionary inquiries, in each they work differently. This differential work, I argue, marks the differing capacities of illocutionary and perlocutionary inquiries adequately to describe a discursive event. Different construals of speech as action tell different tales of uptake or linking, enabling and constraining different accounts of discursive events. With this in mind, I turn by way of an extended example in chapter 4 to the caso Belsunce, a high-profile homicide case begun in Argentina in 2002. I do so to suggest that a focus on utterance actions as semio-discursive events relates the perlocutionary concerns discussed in chapters 1 &#8211; 3 to postulates of cultural memory-work, kairos and rhetorical community. Taken together, this range of concerns helps us to describe the mediatic uptake of the Belsunce case as a particular, complex semio-discursive event. But a description of a discursive event is of course itself a sign, something which, as Peirce notes, &#8216;stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity&#8217; and which strives, in turn, to determine subsequent interpretant effects. In this respect, the critical description of discursive events is itself an instance of speech as action which cannot but continue to raise hermeneutic, rhetorical and semiotic questions of discursive upshot or uptake.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genre theory</field><field name="subject">rhetoric theory</field><field name="subject">semiotics</field><field name="subject">peirce</field><field name="subject">speech act theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exception Management in Logistics: An Intelligent Decision-Making Approach</field><field name="creator">Shi-jia Gao</field><field name="description">In recent years businesses around the world have been facing the challenges of a rapidly changing business and technology environment. As a result, organisations are paying more attention to supporting business process management by adapting to the dynamic environment. With the increased complexity and uncertainty in business operations, adaptive and collaborative business process and exception management (EM) are gaining attention. In the logistics industry, the growing importance of logistics worldwide as well as the increasing complexity of logistics networks and the service requirement of customers has become a challenge. The current logistics exceptions are managed using human brain power together with the traditional workflow technology-based supply-chain management or other logistics tools. The traditional workflow technology models and manages business processes and anticipated exceptions based on predefined logical procedures of activities from a centralised perspective. This situation offers inadequate decision support for flexibility and adaptability in logistics EM. The traditional workflow technology is also limited to monitoring the logistics activities in real-time to detect and resolve exceptions in a timely manner. To mitigate these problems, an intelligent agent incorporating business activity monitoring (BAM) decision support approach in logistics EM has been proposed and investigated in this research. This research creates and evaluates two IT designed artefacts (conceptual framework and prototype) intended to efficiently and automatically monitor and handle logistics exceptions. It follows a design science research strategy. The design, development, and evaluation adhere to the principles enunciated in the design science literature. The aim of this research is to solve the important logistics EM problem in a more effective and efficient manner. Two designed artefacts were strictly informed by, and incorporated with, three different theories. An exploratory case study and a later confirmatory case study assisted in the rigorous derivation of the design and framework. The results of the confirmatory case study were used in particular to refine the designed artefacts. Such a build-and-evaluate loop iterated several times before the final designed artefacts were generated. The designed artefacts were then evaluated empirically via a field experiment. The research included both a technical presentation and a practical framing in terms of application in the logistics exception monitoring and handling domain. In this study, there were three interrelated research phases. In the first research phase, a decision-making conceptual framework (an artefact) for design and development of real-time logistics EM system was developed. To enable more efficient decision support practices for logistics EM, the characteristics of logistics exceptions were first examined and identified. The logistics exception analysis was conducted through a comprehensive literature review and an exploratory case study conducted in a major logistics company in Australia. The logistics exceptions were then classified into known and knowable categories, based on the Cynefin sense-making framework (Snowden, 2002). On the basis of the logistics analysis, informed by Gartner&#8217;s three-layer BAM architecture (Dresner, 2003), the Cynefin sense-making framework decision models (Snowden, 2002), and Simon&#8217;s (1977) decision-making/problem-solving process, the real-time logistics EM conceptual framework was depicted. The BAM architecture provided the real-time decision support. Based on Cynefin&#8217;s decision model, adaptive business process flow was chosen for known and knowable logistics exceptions to speed up the decision-making process. In addition, Simon&#8217;s process theory was deployed to model the diagnosing process for known and knowable logistics exceptions. This conceptual model guided the analysis, design, and development for real-time logistics EM systems. In the second research phase, based on the logistics EM conceptual framework, a Web-service-multi-agent-based real-time logistics EM system (an artefact) was designed and developed. Intelligent agent technology was applied to deal with the complex, dynamic, and distributed logistics EM processes. Web-services techniques were proposed for more interoperability and scalability in network-based business environment. By integrating agent technology with Web-services to make use of the advantages from both, this approach provided a more intelligent, flexible, autonomous, and comprehensive solution to real-time logistics EM. In the third research phase, two designed artefacts were evaluated via a confirmatory case study and a field experiment. The confirmatory case study was conducted to collect feedback on the two designed artefacts (i.e., conceptual framework and prototype system) to refine them. The field experiment was then conducted to investigate the proposed logistics EM prototype system decision support effectiveness and efficiency by comparing the human decision-making performance with/without the logistics EM decision support facility. The evaluation results indicated that the proposed logistics EM prototype outperformed the one without logistics EM decision support in terms of more efficient decision process, higher decision outcome quality, and better user perception. The two designed artefacts were the major contributions of this research. They add knowledge to decision theory and practice. The artefacts are the real-time extension for Simon&#8217;s (1977) classic decision-making/problem-solving process model in logistics EM by incorporating BAM (Dresner, 2003). In addition, by adding the Cynefin sense-making framework (Snowden, 2002), the artefacts provide a more efficient decision-making routine for logistics EM. This research provides the first attempt (to the best of the researcher&#8217;s knowledge) to design a real-time logistics EM decision support mechanism based on decision science theories. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed conceptual framework, a logistics EM decision support prototype was designed, developed, and evaluated. For practice, the logistics exceptions classification, logistics EM conceptual framework, and incorporating agent technologies into logistics EM all will assist logistics companies to develop their logistics exception handling decision-making strategies and solutions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="subject">decision science</field><field name="subject">design science</field><field name="subject">exception management</field><field name="subject">Business activity monitoring</field><field name="subject">Logistics</field><field name="subject">decision support system</field><field name="subject">business intelligence application</field><field name="subject">Intelligent agents</field><field name="subject">business process management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Drinfeld Double of Dihedral Groups and Integrable Systems</field><field name="creator">Peter Finch</field><field name="description">A little over 20 years ago Drinfeld presented the quantum (or Drinfeld) double construction. This construction takes any Hopf algebra and embeds it in a larger quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, which contains an algebraic solution to the constant Yang&#8211;Baxter equation. One such class of algebras consists of the Drinfeld doubles of &#64257;nite groups, which are currently of interest due to their connections with non-Abelian anyons. The smallest non-commutative Drinfeld double of a &#64257;nite group algebra is the Drinfeld double of D3 , the dihedral group of order six, which was recently used to construct solutions to the Yang&#8211;Baxter equation cor- responding to 2-state and 3-state integrable spin chains with periodic boundary conditions. In this thesis we construct R-matrices from the Drinfeld double of dihedral group algebras, D(Dn) and consider their associated integrable systems. The 3-state spin chain from D(D3) is generalised to include open boundaries and it is also shown that there exists a more general R-matrix for this algebra. For general D(Dn) an R-matrix is constructed as a descendant of the zero-&#64257;eld six-vertex model.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yang-baxter Equation</field><field name="subject">descendants</field><field name="subject">Drinfeld double</field><field name="subject">quantum double</field><field name="subject">finite group algebra</field><field name="subject">dihedral group</field><field name="subject">Integrable Systems</field><field name="subject">Reflection Equation</field><field name="subject">R-matrices</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of the Impact of Note Taking on the Quality of Mock Jurors&#8217; Decisions</field><field name="creator">Tanya Strub</field><field name="description">Abstract This research investigated the extent to which taking notes influenced the quality of mock jurors&#8217; decisions. High quality decisions were defined in this research as those which did not reflect the influence of the offender stereotype. The impact of note taking on the quality of jurors&#8217; decisions is central to the judicial community&#8217;s concerns about note taking as a jury aid and their willingness to offer it in trial contexts. Previous research has argued that note takers make better quality decisions than non-note takers because note takers recall more trial content and make judgements that better reflect the evidence presented. However, according to dual process models of persuasion, high quality decisions should show evidence of both effortful processing of information and no influence of peripheral cues, such as stereotypes. To date, the existing literature has neglected to consider the extent to which note takers, as compared to non-note takers, are influenced by peripheral cues. The current research sought to address this by investigating the extent to which note taking and non-note taking mock jurors were influenced by stereotypes when making decisions in a mock criminal trial. In particular, note taking and non-note taking mock jurors were presented with a criminal trial in which either a male or female defendant had been charged with a stereotypically masculine crime (e.g., aggravated robbery or murder). The extent to which mock jurors were more likely to convict the male defendant and acquit the female defendant was used as a marker of the extent that stereotypes about offenders influenced participants in these studies. Across studies, note takers&#8217; perceptions of guilt, evaluation of the defendant, and, in some instances, recall of trial content, reflected stereotype-based processing while the corresponding measures for non-note takers did not. This research then went on to investigate why note takers were more vulnerable to the influence of stereotypes than non-note takers. It was proposed that one reason might be the requirement that note takers simultaneously record and evaluate trial content. Previous research has shown that persons engaged in dual tasks rely on stereotypes to increase information processing efficiency and are therefore able to re-direct cognitive resources to the additional task. Consistent with previous studies, the current research found that both note takers and mock jurors engaged in an additional task during the trial were more vulnerable to the influence of stereotypes than non-note takers. Furthermore, whilst investigating interventions designed to reduce the influence of stereotypes on note takers&#8217; decisions, results revealed that such interventions were less successful in improving decision quality than interventions that removed the requirement to engage in dual tasks. In particular, the influence of stereotypes was reduced when note takers were encouraged to elaborate on the content of their notes during designated review periods. Whilst methodological features of this research program--namely a reliance on student samples and the relative brevity of mock trials used--may have led to an underestimation of the reliance on stereotypes for note takers, the research has implications for the instructions given to jurors about note taking in judicial contexts. Specifically, the central conclusion of the thesis is that it would seem prudent to amend instructions to direct note takers to engage in the effortful review of their notes prior to coming together to reach a verdict.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">note taking and review</field><field name="subject">dual process models of persuasion</field><field name="subject">juror</field><field name="subject">Dual Task</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Quantitative Genetics of Nevus Count and Other Pigmentary Characteristics of the Skin</field><field name="creator">Gu Zhu</field><field name="description">Australia has the highest incidence of melanoma in the world. Melanocytic nevi and mutations in the CDKN2A gene are the main risk factors for the development of cutaneous melanocytic melanoma, and particularly in those of European descent. My study uses genetic epidemiological methods to investigate causes of variation in the number of melanocytic nevi and pigmentary traits such as freckles, eye colour, hair colour and skin colour collected on a sample of adolescent twins and siblings from the Brisbane Twin Nevus Study (1992-2006). Information was available for 2524 individuals from 973 families (from the first visit when the twins were aged 12 years), and from a repeat visit (two years later) for 1598 individuals from 791 families. Using the twin study design extended to siblings and parents, variance components analyses showed that the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic factors ranged from 43 to 99 percent for the traits studied. The atypical nevus count and freckles showed sex differences in the magnitude of genetic and environmental effects. Genetic correlations among counts of three types of nevus (flat, raised and clinically atypical) ranged from 0.46 to 0.63. Nevus count was genetically correlated with skin colour (r=0.23). I analysed genome-wide linkage data using a total of 1190 microsatellite (STR) markers from three scans for 644 families with 1646 twins and siblings, plus genotypes for 1033 parents. These were combined with an additional 169 families with genome-wide association 100K SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data, where I selected a linkage analysis panel of 13,000 SNPs making a total of 3365 individuals from 811 families (each individual had more than 200 markers typed). Suggestive linkages for flat nevus count (FNC) were identified on chromosomes 2p25 and 9p21 with lod scores of 3.19 and 2.62 respectively. For raised nevus count (RNC), a suggestive QTL with a lod score of 2.20 was found on chromosome 2q37.2, and for atypical nevus count (ANC) a lod score of 2.71 was found on chromosome 7p14.1. There was suggestive evidence of linkage for freckling on chromosomes 2 and 9. Eye colour was strongly linked (lod=17.86) to chromosome 15, at the OCA2 locus. I have also carried out genetic association analyses using the 100K SNP data in 169 families, and additional fine mapping using SNPs (as well as STR markers) in the complete data set. A sample size of 169 families (461 twins) for genome-wide association data means that statistical power is low. From the 100K SNP data, the best association for total nevus count (TNC) was with SNP rs2420070, p=6.0&#215;10-6 on chromosome 10, and included another two nearby SNPs; rs7086663, p=2.0&#215;10-4 and rs7090904, p=1.5&#215;10-4. These 3 SNPs also showed possible association with FNC; rs2420070, p=3.9&#215;10-6, rs2420070, p=1.3&#215;10-4 and rs2420070, p=8.9&#215;10-5. For raised nevus count the top three associated SNPs were rs1885238, p=1.8&#215;10-5 on chromosome 9; rs10503048, p=3.7&#215;10-5 on chromosome 18 and rs4769189, p=4.0&#215;10-5 on chromosome 13. SNP rs1412341 which is located near CDKN2A on chromosome 9, was also associated with p=2.8&#215;10-4. There were a total 18 SNPs which showed evidence of association with atypical nevus count, the strongest signal being with rs951099 (p=3.7&#215;10-5) on chromosome 9. In a fine-mapping dataset, I studied the association of CDKN2A SNP rs2218220 with TNC, FNC, RNC and ANC. The best SNP, rs2218220, gave p values of 2.8&#215;10-10, 7.7&#215;10-8, 2.7&#215;10-12 and 9.1&#215;10-8, respectively. A SNP, rs1800407 (R419Q) located in the OCA2 gene (chromosome 15q11.2-15q12) showed evidence of association with eye colour and particularly with blue and green eye colours, (p=1.7&#215;10-12 and p=6.0&#215;10-7). SNP rs12913832 from the Hect Domain and RCC1-like Domain 2 gene (HERC2) on chromosome 15q13.1, was also strongly associated with eye colour p=3.6&#215;10-155. This SNP was associated with blue (p= 7.9&#215;10-150) and brown (p=5.3&#215;10-158), but not green eye colour. In addition I confirmed the association of the MC1R SNP rs1805007 and freckling (p=4.8&#215;10-12). This SNP was also associated with FNC (p=3.5&#215;10-8), a finding not previously described in the literature. I also carried out multi-allelic association analysis using STR markers with these traits and uncovered suggestive findings for several regions. Finally, I conducted a multivariate association analysis searching for SNPs with pleiotropic effects. The most interesting results for all types of nevi were with rs801840, p=3.5&#215;10-5, and rs10487075, p=4.9&#215;10-5, both on chromosome 7q21.13. Another four SNPs on chromosome 8p23.1 also showed associations, rs7009724, p=1.4&#215;10-4, rs10503389, p=1.9&#215;10-4, rs7832398, p=6.2&#215;10-4 and rs7005133, p=6.9&#215;10-4 (close to a candidate gene, MFHAS1, implicated in sarcoma risk). In conclusion I have characterised a number of definite and possible genetic factors influencing important risk factors for melanoma.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Twin</field><field name="subject">nevus</field><field name="subject">freckles</field><field name="subject">Pigmentation</field><field name="subject">Melanoma</field><field name="subject">Linkage</field><field name="subject">Association</field><field name="subject">Disequilibrium</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsive Workflows: Design, Execution and Analysis of Interruption Policy Models</field><field name="creator">Belinda Melanie Carter</field><field name="description">Business processes form the backbone of all business operations, and workflow technology has enabled companies to gain significant productivity benefits through the automatic enactment of routine, repetitive processes. Process automation can be achieved by encoding the business rules and procedures into the applications, but capturing the process logic in a graphical workflow model allows the process to be specified, validated and ultimately maintained by business analysts with limited technical knowledge. The process models can also be automatically verified at design-time to detect structural issues such as deadlock and ensure correct data flow during process execution. These benefits have resulted in the success of workflow technology in a variety of industries, although workflows are often criticised for being too rigid, particularly in light of their recent deployment in collaborative applications such as e-business. Generally, many events can impact on the execution of a workflow process. Initially, the workflow is triggered by an external event (for example, receipt of an order). Participants then interact with the workflow system through the worklist as they perform constituent tasks of the workflow, driving the progression of each process instance through the model until its completion. For traditional workflow processes, this functionality was sufficient. However, new generation 'responsive' workflow technology must facilitate interaction with the external environment during workflow execution. For example, during the execution of an 'order to cash' process, the customer may attempt to cancel the order or update the shipping address. We call these events 'interruptions'. The potential occurrence of interruptions can be anticipated but, unlike the other workflow events, they are never required to occur in order to successfully execute any process instance. Interruptions can also occur at any stage during process execution, and may therefore be considered as 'expected, asynchronous exceptions' during the execution of workflow processes. Every interruption must be handled, and the desired reaction often depends on the situation. For example, an address update may not be permitted after a certain point, where this point depends on the customer type, and a shipping charge or refund may be applicable, depending on the original and new delivery region. Therefore, a set of rules is associated with each interruption, such that if a condition is satisfied when the event occurs, a particular action is to be performed. This set of rules forms a policy to handle each interruption. Several workflow systems do facilitate the automatic enforcement of 'exception handling' rules and support the reuse of code fragments to enable the limited specification and maintenance of rules by non-technical users. However, this functionality is not represented in a formal, intuitive model. Moreover, we argue that inadequate consideration is given to the verification of the rules, with insufficient support provided for the detection of issues at design-time that could hinder effective maintenance of the process logic or interfere with the interruption handling functionality at run-time. This thesis presents a framework to capture, analyse and enforce interruption process logic for highly responsive processes without compromising the benefits of workflow technology. We address these issues in two stages. In the first stage, we consider that the reaction to an interruption event is dependent on three factors: the progress of the process instance with respect to the workflow model, the values of the associated case data variables at the time at which the event occurs, and the data embedded in the event. In the second stage, we consider that the reaction to each interruption event may also depend on the other events that have also been detected, that is, we allow interruptions to be defined through event patterns or complex events. We thus consider the issues of definition, analysis and enactment for both 'basic' and 'extended' interruption policy models. First, we introduce a method to model interruption policies in an intuitive but executable manner such that they may be maintained without technical support. We then address the issue of execution, detailing the required system functionality and proposing a reference architecture for the automatic enforcement of the policies. Finally, we introduce a set of formal, generic correctness criteria and a verification procedure for the models. For extended policy models, we introduce and compare two alternative execution models for the evaluation of logical expressions that represent interruption patterns. Finally, we present a thorough analysis of related verification issues, considering both the system and user perspectives, in order to ensure correct process execution and also provide support for the user in semantic validation of the interruption policies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">workflow systems</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">verification</field><field name="subject">business processes</field><field name="subject">expression evaluation</field><field name="subject">rules</field><field name="subject">specification</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Legal Ramifications of Information System and Data Security Compromise: A review of issues, technology and law.</field><field name="creator">Quentin Cregan</field><field name="description">Computer intrusions and attacks compromise individuals, companies and communities. Whilst it is clear that computer and information security studies point to a generalised increase in the number and sophistication of computer security attacks over the past decade and that nations now entirely rely upon computer systems, insufficient attention is paid to the protection of those systems. Computer data and network systems affect our everyday lives, from the supply-chain software that ensures that the shelves are stocked at the supermarket, to systems that manage finance and share markets. Compromises of computer security are, therefore, rightly seen both as an attack on those individual entities whose systems and information are compromised, and as a communal attack upon the people and organisations that rely upon or use computer systems, both directly and indirectly. The aim of this thesis is to give an analysis of computer system security, information protections and the legal ramifications of computer security compromise, notably, data security compromise in Australia. Ultimately, the aim is to address three overlapping questions: what are the ways in which systems are breached, what are the legal consequences of a breach and are those consequences adequate? This paper looks at the underlying technology and relationships between actors involved in the majority of security compromises and looks at the common factors in how systems and networks are attacked and actors damaged. The paper then goes on to look at criminal liability for security compromises and shows how a criminal analysis feeds into the proper civil law consideration of the topic. Finally, the paper looks at data security through the lens of privacy. Ultimately, this paper concludes that Australia is inconsistent in its legal responses to information security incidents. Such variations are based on the area of law being discussed and dependent on the breach methodology and outcome. The criminal law provides the most current and potent legal protection any business or individual has had in this field. This is followed by statutory privacy law which provides a narrow degree of coverage and provides only a weak conciliation process for addressing data security issues. Finally, common law and equity provide the most uncertain commercial remedies for those that suffer data security breach. This paper concludes that present protections are inadequate and uncertain, and that change is required.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">18 Law and Legal Studies</field><field name="subject">information security, data liability, cybercrime, negligence, ddos, data protection, privacy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Needs-based and needs-focused care: Understanding the needs of children and young people in care in Australia through the documentary analysis of multiple stakeholder perspectives</field><field name="creator">Stewart Redshaw</field><field name="description">Over the last decade out-of-home care in Australia has experienced a period of considerable turmoil as royal commissions, parliamentary inquiries, departmental audits, empirical research and industry reports have highlighted the dire straits of the care system. A constant theme throughout has been the failure of the sector to adequately meet the needs of children and young people in care. Within this context the purpose of this study was to examine the needs of children and young people in care in Australia, giving voice to the full range of stakeholders, whose views were expressed in multiple documentary types. Specifically, the aim was to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs and formulate this into a formal taxonomy of needs. Using document analysis and the constant comparative method within the constructivist paradigm of social inquiry, the study involved analysis of 580 non-traditional, naturalistic and secondary documents relating to out-of-home care in Australia. The document sample consisted of five data types: primary data (letters, submissions to inquiries, transcripts of interviews and public hearings, and personal accounts); secondary data (reports resulting from commissions of inquiries and departmental reviews, audits and investigations); empirical data (the published findings from empirical research); legislative and policy data (legislation, regulation and quality frameworks); and industry and practitioner data (reports by academics, peak bodies and advocacy groups, and writings by out-of-home care practitioners). Further, the document sample included stakeholders from five major groups: children and young people in care (and former wards ); their parents and extended family; carers, agency staff and practitioners; statutory workers; and academics, advocates, and representatives of state and national peak bodies. The findings include a series of prominent themes of care; salient findings that highlight the experiences and needs of children and young people in care; and the taxonomy of needs. The prominent themes include the importance of natural family connectedness, cultural identity and connectedness, and counselling and therapeutic support. Issues relating to placement stability and disruption, safety and protection and, transition from care also featured prominently. The salient findings include an exploration of the overwhelming emotions of care, emotional putdowns, vicarious trauma and the witnessing of violence and abuse in out-of-home care, characteristics of children and young people who survive and thrive in care and beyond, characteristics of quality carers, symptom intolerance, disenfranchised grief &#8211; the never-ending story, and the defensive behaviours of children and young people in care. The taxonomy of needs provides a comprehensive overview of the needs of children and young people in care across 89 attributes and 21 attribute sub-categories, within 21 dimensions, and across three domains (the personal, placement, and community-of-care domains). The dimensions in the personal domain include attachment, physical development and health, personal growth, education and vocational attainment, development of the inner-self, and hope in life and for the future. The placement domain includes basic needs, basic entitlements, caring relationships, positive-parenting-practices, activity programming, focused-support, peer-relations and positive group management, and preparation for and transition from care. The community-of-care domain includes clinical intervention, family connectedness and involvement in placement, friends and social outlets, significant others, cultural-religious-spiritual connectedness, departmental worker capacity and support, and after care support. The principal theoretical, practice, and methodological conclusions derived from this study are that children and young people in care in Australia have considerable needs, are largely unable to meet their own needs, and experience harm when their needs are not met. Consequently, the out-of-home care sector has an inescapable obligation to provide for these needs if children and young people in care are to avoid harm and experience personal wellbeing. Further, children and young people in care have experienced considerable need deprivation, and if their needs are not to be forgotten, then a shift to a &#8216;needs-based&#8217;, &#8216;needs-focused&#8217; paradigm of care is needed to inform out-of-home care policy, service design, and day-to-day practice. And finally, document analysis using non-traditional, naturalistic, and secondary data (representing the full range of stakeholder perspectives) within a constructivist paradigm of inquiry, provides an effective, indeed powerful methodology for exploring the needs of children and young people in care, and for giving voice to the many stakeholders who voices may never have been heard again.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Needs</field><field name="subject">Out-of-home care</field><field name="subject">Taxonomy</field><field name="subject">Wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Quality care</field><field name="subject">Document analysis</field><field name="subject">Constant comparative method</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Email-based Telemedicine: Design and validation of a decision support model for service-delivery application</field><field name="creator">Liam Caffery</field><field name="description">There is a growing realisation from the Australian government that new models of health care will need to be developed to address the disparity of access, increasing demand and escalating cost of traditional means of delivering health care. There is growing evidence showing health care services can be delivered safely and efficiently by email. Despite this body of evidence the clinical utility of email is occurring at a much slower rate than in other business areas. Technological barriers and privacy risks are often cited as cause of the fragmented adoption and utilisation of email-based telemedicine. In addressing these impediments, the service-delivery application needs to be considered. The service-delivery applications used in email-based telemedicine can be divided into two distinct categories. The first is ordinary email applications &#8212; such as the commercial products used for personal communication &#8212; and the second is where the health care provider undertakes the development of an email application purpose-written to support their telemedicine service. This aim of this research was to develop a decision support model (DSM) to address the complex issues in choosing the service-delivery application most appropriate for an email service. Three areas which would influence a provider&#8217;s decision were identified &#8212; i) privacy and security ii) economics and ii) quality of service &#8212; and investigated. Most emails are sent in plain text across the Internet and pose a privacy risk. Encryption of the email message is used to mitigate the risk. Two means of encryption were investigated: public key infrastructure (PKI) used in conjunction with ordinary email and secure web-mail applications, which require the development of a purpose-written application. Decisive factors in choosing the most appropriate privacy-enhancing technology for an email-based service were identified by a number of means including: technical assessment of encryption models, literature review, survey of users of an email-based telemedicine service and analysis of client applications used in a telemedicine service. This investigation established that correspondent&#8217;s perception to privacy risk, email client application support of PKI, risk tolerance to human error and the technical skill are decisive factors in choosing privacy-enhancing technology. The survey respondents considered a privacy breach during email communication was either likely or very unlikely regardless of whether the communication was encrypted or not. Indicating correspondents are unlikely to comply with encryption especially if the technology is cumbersome. Although the population was of a limited demographic, there was a large proliferation (around 87%) of web-mail clients &#8212; for example, Hotmail and Gmail &#8212; amongst the users of email-based telemedicine services. Web-mail clients cannot be secured with PKI. Hence, assessment of client-email applications used by correspondents in telemedicine will influence the type of privacy-enhancing technology. Technical assessment of privacy-enhancing technology has identified human-error as a risk when using PKI. Secure web-mail obviates human-error. Therefore, tolerance to human-error risk will be decisive in choice of privacy-enhancing technology. PKI has received criticism for being user-unfriendly and requiring technical proficiency to use. This investigation has established the usability of secure web-mail is comparable to ordinary, unencrypted email. Indicating secure communication is feasible when services are not supported by technical expertise. The cost of providing an email-based service is influenced by the service-delivery application. To develop a purpose-written application will cost the heath care provider but staff may be able to work more efficiently because the resultant application contains telemedicine specific functionality that meet the exact requirements of the service. Staff resources to run an email-based telemedicine service using ordinary email were compared to staff resources to run the same service using a purpose-written application. The purpose-written application afforded a reduction of 3% in time for clinical staff. Ancillary staff savings were more pronounced with a 33% reduction in administrative staff time and a 21% reduction in supervisory staff time. A cost-minimisation analysis established at a workload of up to 5000 email consultations per annum it is more economical to the run the service with ordinary email. For higher workload volumes it is cheaper to run the service with a purpose-written application. The threshold of 5000 emails consultations is the point at which the higher initial development cost of a purpose- written application are offset by staff efficiencies. A sensitivity analysis established the most influential factor in the economic model was workload volume &#8212; development costs and variable costs had little influence on the threshold. Response time was established as a quality of service metric after investigation demonstrated increases in response time were strongly correlated with a decrease in utilisation rate. The response time to maximise the utilisation rate was 32h or less. Pre- and post- studies demonstrated a purpose-written application can reduce response times. Telemedicine specific functionality in a purpose-written application was also investigated. Conditions for a purpose-written application &#8212; for example, use of multi-disciplinary staff, a priority service model and continuum of care over multiple email exchanges &#8212; to be efficacious at reducing response times were established. The conditions identified in the privacy and security, economic and quality of service investigation were amalgamated into a DSM. The DSM was retrospectively tested by comparing the output of the model to a gold-standard of the actual service-delivery used by a number of subject organisations. When used to identify services that required a purpose-written application the DSM was 92% sensitive and 92% specific. The model was also tested prospectively and demonstrated 85% concordance from testers in the choosing the service-delivery application. Testing the DSM identified strengths for both ordinary email and purpose-written applications under different circumstances &#8212; indicating both are valid alternatives for email-based telemedicine. The individual requirements of a telemedicine service &#8212; for example, privacy requirements, participants, the workload volume, number of staff disciplines, mode of service &#8212; will dictate the choice of the most appropriate service-delivery application. Informed decision on when and why to use a service-delivery application has implications for the successful delivery of email-based telemedicine services because the choice of service-delivery application will affect: - The staff resources needed to run the service; - The capital cost of implementing a service; - The operating costs of running a service; - The response times to client emails which in turn, influences the utilisation of the service; - The privacy-enhancing technology which in turn, influences the usability and compliance to legislative and statutory requirements.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">email</field><field name="subject">store-and-forward</field><field name="subject">telemedicine</field><field name="subject">telehealth</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">psychiatry</field><field name="subject">encryption</field><field name="subject">Public Key Infrastruture</field><field name="subject">Health Economics</field><field name="subject">cost-minimisation analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strategies to enhance efficiency of microbial protein production in cattle consuming tropical forages</field><field name="creator">Tanda Sahat Sastradarmaja Panjaitan</field><field name="description">Microbial crude protein (MCP) is the main source of protein supplied to ruminants. Several studies report that the efficiency of MCP production (eMCP) from tropical forages is low due to low rumen degradable protein (RDP) content. The studies reported in this thesis determined the eMCP from tropical forages varying in crude protein (CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD), examined strategies to increase eMCP and the possible practical methods of application under extensive cattle production systems. This was done through four metabolism experiments, one rate of digestion experiment and a preference test experiment. In Experiment 1, the eMCP of 3 tropical forages (speargrass (Heteropogon contortus), Mitchell grass (Astrebla spp) and pangola grass (Digitaria eriantha)), and temperate ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum cultivar aristocrat) was measured. All tropical forages were associated with low eMCP (102 - 110 g MCP/kg digestible organic matter (DOM)) due to low CP and RDP content. The RDP content of the tropical forages ranged from 43 - 103 g RDP/kg DOM compared to 214 g RDP/kg DOM in ryegrass. Retention time of Cr-EDTA and Ytterbium in the rumen ranged from 13 - 34 and 29 - 59 h for tropical forages respectively, compared to 10.2 and 13.2 h for ryegrass. In Experiment 2, the rate of digestion of speargrass, Mitchell grass and ryegrass varied when incubated in the rumen of steers consuming speargrass hay (1.8% CP). Addition of a variety of nitrogen supplements; urea-ammonium sulphate (US), US plus branch chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) plus phenylalanine (USAA), casein, cottonseed meal (CSM), yeast and Chlorella (Chlorella pyrenoidea) algae to supply approximately 170 g RDP/kg DOM improved the rate of digestion of all three substrates. However, there was no difference in rate of digestion of the three substrates between the different nitrogen supplements. In Experiments 3 and 4, steers fed medium quality pangola grass hay (9.9% CP and 61% DMD) or low quality Mitchell grass hay (4.5% CP and 41% DMD) were supplemented with US, casein and USAA. US was provided at 130, 170, 210 and 250 g RDP/kg DOM. The USAA treatment was provided at a RDP/DOM of 170 with US and then amino acids (USAA) were provided in the same ratio and level as the amino acids in the casein treatment at 130, 170, 250 and 300 g RDP/kg DOM. Increased RDP intake from all supplements increased the rumen ammonia-N concentration for both hays. The molar percentage of branch chain fatty acids (BCFA) increased 3 - 4 fold (6.6% of total VFA) above control with increasing intake of USAA or casein supplements for both hays. However, eMCP did not increase in response to increasing RDP intake from either supplement for both hays. The RDP supplementation also had no effect on intake, rate of digestion and retention time of Cr-EDTA in the rumen. In Experiment 5, steers fed Mitchell grass hay (3.8% CP and 44% DMD) were supplemented with US and Spirulina (Spirulina platensis) algae. The US was supplied to provide 90, 130, 170 and 210 g RDP/kg DOM and the Spirulina supplied to provide 90, 130, 170 and 290 g RDP/kg DOM. Increased RDP intake from US and Spirulina was associated with linear and quadratic increases in eMCP respectively. The eMCP at the highest level of US (93 g MCP/kg DOM) was below the minimum feeding standards value of 130 g MCP/kg DOM, whilst the highest level of Spirulina reached the higher end of the feeding standards (166 g MCP/kg DOM). Increasing RDP intake resulted in increased hay DM intake and total DOM intake, which were both higher for the Spirulina than the US supplement (24.5 vs.18.5 g DM/kg W/d and 11.9 vs. 7.6 g DOM/kg W/d). The retention time of Cr-EDTA and lignin in the rumen decreased with increasing RDP intake and were both shorter with Spirulina compared with US supplementation (15 vs. 21 h for Cr-EDTA; 45 vs. 56 h for lignin). In addition, Spirulina increased the BCFA concentration to 4.2% of total VFA. In Experiment 6, four different concentrations of Spirulina solution were offered to steers fed restricted amounts (14 g DM/kg W/d) of pangola hay (3.4% CP). Drinking water containing Spirulina was highly preferred and had no deleterious effect on water or hay intake. Steers strongly preferred Spirulina solution to water, when offered both solutions. Approximately 20.5% of imbibed water by-passed the rumen, which was not influenced by the Spirulina concentration in the drinking water. It may be concluded that RDP is the primary factor affecting eMCP. High eMCP was associated with low retention time of water in the rumen and high intake. Once RDP is not limiting eMCP, a source of RDP rich in true protein, nucleic acids, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals, such as Spirulina algae, may be required for cattle fed low quality tropical hay to achieve the maximum eMCP reported in the feeding standards.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">eMCP</field><field name="subject">MCP</field><field name="subject">RDP</field><field name="subject">Supplementation</field><field name="subject">Low quality forage</field><field name="subject">Beef cattle</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISATION OF SAMPLES OF ORE PARTICLES USING X-RAY MICRO-TOMOGRAPHY</field><field name="creator">Murat Cakici</field><field name="description">The degree of mineral liberation is important for the efficiency of subsequent physical separation processes such as froth flotation. Mineral liberation studies involve determining the volumetric abundance or volumetric grade distribution of a specific mineralogical phase in a particular mineral. Currently, methodologies for assessing mineral liberation are laborious regarding sample preparation, analysis time (from weeks to months), and the need for stereological correction. These constraints can be eliminated by using X-ray CT which gives the cross-sections directly from three-dimensional data in shorter time (from ten minutes to hours) with minimal sample preparation. X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a non-destructive technique which allows three-dimensional visualisation of inner structures of an object based on the variations in density and atomic composition. Initially, it was developed as a medical tool for imaging soft tissue and bone. During the last decade, the number of X-ray CT applications in engineering and geology has steadily increased, with the improvements in performance and imaging capabilities. The aim of the present work is to apply X-ray CT technique for finely divided ore samples and to study the relationship between mineral liberation and CT results. Four different ore types were used in this study: Northparkes ore (Australia), Ernest Henry ore (Australia), Keetac ore (USA) and Cannington ore (Australia). Different settings of the desktop X-ray CT technique were applied for each particular ore sample for several ore liberation (particle size distribution) properties. Two dimensional CT images were reconstructed from the three-dimensional X-ray CT data. It was found that the settings for CT technique were a function of the ore type. Particularly in the case of Cannington (high density ore) the best setting conditions split from the rest of the ores tested. The appearance of different artifacts occurring during the analysis were studied and kept to the minimum. A functionality between mineral liberation and CT results was found. The variables affecting the most the results were the Voltage and Minimum Intensity Percentage. Contrary to the expected trends, variables having a negligible effect on the results were found to be exposure time / equivalent Al filter thickness.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mineral processing, mineral liberation, x-ray micro-tomography, cone beam tomography</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christology in Crisis: An Assessment and Response</field><field name="creator">Dean Smith</field><field name="description">The tradition of classical Christology, understood in a MacIntyrean sense as an historically extended and socially embodied argument, is facing an epistemological crisis due to the fact that, at each stage in its complex development, it has failed to resolve the problems arising out of the articulation of the classical interpretation of the Incarnation. This failure on the part of the tradition is due to the unsatisfactory and intractable metaphysical dualism at its heart. This dualism, highlighted in each successive attempt to explain the union of the divine and human natures in Christ, is to be understood as a symptom of a more fundamental God-world dualism, entailed by the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, and informing the traditional Christian conceptual scheme. Failure to recognise and address the God-world problematic has led to one-sided Christological solutions that reflect and reinforce this original and most basic dualism. An alternative view of God is needed to inform Christology if the problematic dualism at the heart of the classical model is to be overcome and the epistemological crisis resolved. Pan(en)theism is such an alternative model of God that offers resources for a non-dualistic Christopraxis.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">22 Philosophy and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">Christology, classical Christology, Alasdair MacIntyre, Karl Rahner, panentheism, dualism, epistemological crisis, creation ex nihilo, incommensurability, tradition.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships between hypothalamic gene expression and the resumption of ovulation in postpartum beef cows</field><field name="creator">Ainu Husna M S Suhaimi</field><field name="description">The aim in this thesis was to gain an understanding of changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus of postpartum beef cows during the period of transition from suppressed ovarian follicular growth to increased follicular growth, and the resumption of ovulation. Beef cows tend to have an extended period of anoestrus after calving. This trait is particularly pronounced in tropically-adapted Zebu breeds. In addition to a genetic component, the postpartum anoestrous period can be influenced by age, body condition, the nutrient requirement of lactation, suckling stimulus, and maternal bonding. An extended postpartum anoestrous period is particularly evident in primiparous beef cows. This is understandable given that primiparous cows have yet to reach their mature body size which means there is a requirement to maintain maternal tissue growth whilst at the same time directing nutrients for milk production. Weaning removes maternal bonding, the suckling stimulus and nutrient requirement of milk production and, provided that nutrient supply and body condition are appropriate, primiparous cows show increased ovarian activity and resume ovulation after weaning. In the present thesis, groups of primiparous Zebu cows were weaned to promote increased ovarian follicular growth and hypothalamic gene expression was compared for weaned cows and contemporary cows that continued to lactate. Candidate genes were studied using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and a gene expression microarray was used to discover new genes and gene networks. Gene expression was examined in the anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area (sub-region H1) and posterior ventral hypothalamus (sub-region H2). The demarcation between H1 and H2 was a vertical line from the mid-point of the median eminence-pituitary stalk to the thalamus. Candidate genes studied by qRT-PCR included, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GNRH1), kisspeptin (KISS1), neuropeptide Y (NPY), oestrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and leptin receptor (LEPR). Marked regional expression was demonstrated for these genes. The expression of GNRH1 was greatest in the anterior hypothalamic region (sub-region H1) whilst the expression of KISS1 was greatest in the ventral posterior hypothalamic region (sub-region H2). Relative expression of LEPR, ESR1 and NPY was greater in H2 than H1. The regional gene expression patterns for GNRH1, KISS1, LEPR, ESR1 and NPY in the hypothalamus of cows were consistent with regional expression reported for other species. Weaning was associated with a decrease in the expression of LEPR, ESR1 and NPY. With regard to ovarian phenotype, there was a greater LEPR expression associated with ovarian phenotype 1 (OP1, follicles to 5mm) compared with ovarian phenotype 2 (OP2, follicles to 10mm) and ovarian phenotype 3 (OP3, recently ovulated) in sub-region H1. Relative expressions for ESR1, LEPR and NPY were highly correlated, particularly in sub-region H2. The evaluation of gene expression by microarray for cows with different ovarian phenotypes provided evidence of interactions between hormonal regulation and cell-cell signalling within the hypothalamus. Genes that were differentially expressed for different ovarian phenotypes were associated with reproduction, energy balance, the immune system and stress. Other genes that showed differential expression were involved with cell adhesion, synaptic transmission, ion signalling and neuronal development. The latter findings were interpreted to suggest that neuronal and glial cell plasticity is a feature of changes in reproductive functions of the hypothalamus. The evaluation of gene expression by microarray for weaned and suckled cows, irrespective of ovarian phenotype, identified differentially expressed genes associated with energy balance, fluid homeostasis, milk synthesis, stress, and oestrogen signalling. With regard the latter, thirty seven genes involved in oestrogen signalling through ESR1, or in other ways associated with oestrogen, were found to be differentially expressed between weaned and lactating cows. ESR1 occupied the central position of a primary gene network based on the present study. Six differentially expressed genes were shown by gene network analysis to be centred in nodes interacting closely with ESR1. Phospholipase-C-gamma (PLCG2), vitronectin (VTN) and endopin 1 (SERPINA3) are three genes associated with hypothalamic plasticity and neurotransmission that were differentially expressed between cows with OP1 and OP2, indicating a possible role in the shift to increased ovarian follicular growth and ovulation. The findings for ESR1 were consistent with the major role of oestrogen in female reproduction and in particular the known actions of oestrogen in regulating the hypothalamus during reproductive transition phases in females associated with puberty, seasonality and postpartum. Gonadotrophin inhibitory hormone (GnIH) is derived from Neuropeptide VF precursor (NPVF), which is encoded by NPVF gene transcripts. NPVF had reduced expression in cows that had ovulated (OP3) compared with OP1 and OP2. GnIH inhibits gonadotrophin secretion by directly acting on GnRH neurons as well as modulating the suppressive effects of oestrogen negative feedback. In addition, GnIH has been shown to play a role in seasonal regulation of reproduction in birds. The lesser expression of NPVF in cows that had resumed ovulation, particularly evident in sub-region H2, provides initial evidence that GnIH has an important role in maintaining the suppressive effects on reproduction during postpartum anoestrus in cattle. In summary, the studies in this thesis have identified hypothalamic genes and gene networks that potentially are important in the control of reproductive function in the postpartum cow. The thesis has also established that the postpartum cow can be used as an experimental model for fundamental studies that generate new knowledge on the reproductive biology of the postpartum period.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">postpartum anoestrus</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">hypothalamus</field><field name="subject">quantitative RT-PCR</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">bovine</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The antecedents of non-affective psychosis: a birth cohort study</field><field name="creator">Joyce Welham</field><field name="description">Background. Despite extensive research the etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. Whilst a substantial body of research points to a developmental component where early risk factors and maturational processes interact to culminate in psychosis during adulthood, key components and processes are yet to be confirmed. Prospective birth cohort studies, with their longitudinal data drawn from the general population, are vital to better understanding these pathways. To date, birth cohort (BC) studies have found that compared to healthy individuals, those who develop schizophrenia are more likely to display subtle deviations in certain developmental domains during infancy, childhood or adolescence. Yet there had been no recent review of these findings to identify areas of agreement, disagreement or where information was lacking. Aims. The overall aim of this dissertation is two-fold: firstly to identify and consolidate the current literature related to the antecedents of schizophrenia based on birth cohort studies; and secondly to undertake empirical studies based on an Australian birth cohort to address specific issues raised in the preceding review. Methods. The following three papers present empirical studies which use common methods based on an Australian birth cohort. Each study was based on a birth cohort of 3801 young adults born between 1981 and 1984, as part of the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its outcomes. An extensive range of behavioural, cognitive, physical and social measures had been taken at various stages during their development namely, antenatally, at birth and six months, and at 5, 14 and 21 year follow-ups. Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained at age 21 follow-up from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), or, if this was not available, on a self-report health outcomes checklist; this produced the outcome variable &#8216;screen-positive non-affective psychosis&#8217; (SP-NAP). The association between antecedents and later SP-NAP were examined using logistic regression adjusted for potentially confounding variables (such as actual age at assessment, cannabis use in adolescence, and gender). Each study also (a) examined differences in case vs. noncase maturation over time; and (b) conducted planned sensitivity and post hoc analyses, such as for source of diagnoses and predictive validity. Analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS). Results. The main findings of the review were that BC studies of schizophrenia provide important insights into both the maturational antecedents of schizophrenia and putative risk modifying factors. Yet while some antecedents, such as neurocognitive dysfunction, have been well documented, others are less certain (such as postnatal physical growth). There are no studies based on pre-morbid attentional measures. In addition, there were no studies of developmental pathways where continuity of maturation was based on within-individual scores rather than group means. These findings led to three empirical studies based on an Australian birth cohort previously untapped in psychosis research. The first study found that higher levels childhood and adolescent general psychopathology increased the risk of SP-NAP. This effect was less clear for females and when adolescent psychopathology had been rated by mothers at the 14-year follow-up. In contrast, self-reported hallucinations at the 14 year follow-up increased the risk of SP-NAP in both sexes. Males with high psychopathology scores in both childhood and adolescence were at greatest risk, followed by males and females whose &#8216;social, attention and thought&#8217; scores were either consistently dysfunctional or worsened from childhood to adolescence (3- to 13-fold risk). The second study found that altered physical growth in infancy and adulthood (increased head circumference and height) raised the risk of SP-NAP for females but not males. For cases, there was no evidence of &#8216;catch-up growth&#8217;, i.e., growth retardation at birth being followed by a period of rapid growth. There was also no group difference in pubertal maturation for males or females. The final study found that dysfunction in childhood and adolescent intelligence, attention and speech increased the risk of SP-NAP for males but not females. Males with persistently high scores or who worsened on measures related to childhood and adolescent attentional problems were at greatest risk of SP-NAP. Discussion. While there are some caveats, disturbed developmental antecedents &#8211; particularly psychopathology and impaired cognition in males &#8211; were more frequently identified in cohort members who developed non-affective psychosis than their peers. More specifically, this disturbed development appeared be in domains which reflect those of the adult disorder and include the possible endophenotypes of psychosis-like experiences, inattention and visuospatial dysfunction. Of interest, self-rated items during adolescence were associated with increased risk of later psychosis. Finally, developmental pathways associated with non-affective psychosis were not uniform in timing but varied depending on such factors as domain and gender. These findings stress that understanding the heterogeneity in developmental pathways is crucial to understanding the heterogeneous nature of the subsequent disorder.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">adolescence, antecedents, birth cohort, childhood, maturation, non-affective psychosis, review,</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia, trajectory, young adulthood.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive Interactive Expectations: Dynamically Modelling Profit Expectations</field><field name="creator">William Paul Bell</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to develop an alternative expectations model to the Rational Expectations Hypothesis (REH) and adaptive-expectations models, which provides more accurate temporal predictive performance and more closely reflects recent advances in behavioural economics, the &#8216;science of complexity&#8217; and network dynamics. The model the thesis develops is called Adaptive Interactive Expectations (AIE), a subjective dynamic model of the process of expectations formation. To REH, the AIE model provides both an alternative and a complement. AIE and REH complement one another in that they are diametrically opposite in the following five dimensions, agent intelligence, agent interaction, agent homogeneity, equilibrium assumptions and the rationalisation process. REH and AIE stress the importance of hyper-intelligent agents interacting only via a price signal and near zero-intelligent agents interacting via a network structure, respectively. The complementary nature of AIE and REH provide dual perspectives that enhance analysis. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B 2008) profit expectations survey is used in the thesis to calibrate AIE and make predictions. The predictive power of the AIE and REH models is compared. The thesis introduces the &#8216;pressure to change profit expectations index&#8217;, px. This index provides the ability to model unknowns within an adaptive dynamic process and combine the beliefs from interactive-expectations, adaptive-expectations and biases that include pessimism, optimism and ambivalence. AIE uses networks to model the flow of interactive-expectations between firms. To overcome the uncertainty over the structure of the interactive network, the thesis uses model-averaging over 121 network topologies. These networks are defined by three variables regardless of their complexity. Unfortunately, the Bayesian technique&#8217;s use of the number of variables as a measure of complexity makes it unsuitable for model-averaging over the network topologies. To overcome this limitation in the Bayesian technique, the thesis introduces two model-averaging techniques, &#8216;runtime-weighted&#8217; and &#8216;optimal-calibration&#8217;. These model-averaging techniques are benchmarked against &#8216;Bayes-factor model-averaging&#8217; and &#8216;equal-weighted model-averaging&#8217;. In addition to the aggregate called all&#8211;firms, the D&amp;B (2008) survey has four divisions, manufacturing durables, manufacturing non&#8211;durables, wholesale and retail. To make use of the four divisions, the thesis introduces a &#8216;link-intensity matrix&#8217; based upon an &#8216;input-output table&#8217; to improve the calibration of the networks. The transpose of the table is also used in the thesis. The two &#8216;link-intensity matrices&#8217; are benchmarked against the default, a &#8216;matrix of ones&#8217;. The aggregated and disaggregated versions of AIE are benchmarked against adaptive-expectations to establish whether the interactive-expectations component of AIE add value to the model. The thesis finds that AIE has more predictive power than REH. &#8216;Optimal-calibration model-averaging&#8217; improves the predictive performance of the better-fitting versions of AIE, which are those versions that use the &#8216;input-output table&#8217; and &#8216;matrix of ones&#8217; link-intensity matrices. The &#8216;runtime-weighted model-averaging&#8217; improves the predictive performance of only the &#8216;input-output table&#8217; version of AIE. The interactive component of the AIE model improves the predictive performance of all versions of the AIE over adaptive-expectations. There is an ambiguous effect on prediction performance from introducing the &#8216;input-output table&#8217;. However, there is a clear reduction in the predictive performance from introducing its transpose. AIE can inform the debate on government intervention by providing an Agent-Based Model (ABM) perspective on the conflicting mathematical and narrative views proposed by the Greenwald&#8211;Stiglitz Theorem and Austrian school, respectively. Additionally, AIE can provide a complementary role to REH, which is descriptive/predictive and normative, respectively. The AIE network calibration uses an &#8216;input-output table&#8217; to determine the link-intensity; this method could provide Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) with a way to improve their transmission mechanism. Furthermore, the AIE network calibration and prediction methodology may help overcome the validation concerns of practitioners when they implement ABM.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">14 Economics</field><field name="subject">Expectations</field><field name="subject">profits</field><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">adaptive</field><field name="subject">interactive</field><field name="subject">model-averaging</field><field name="subject">agent-based modeling and simulation</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Which risk factors are likely to account for the sex differences in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury rates?</field><field name="creator">Jane Grayson</field><field name="description">Female athletes are known to have a higher rate of ACL injuries than male athletes in similar sports. Anatomical, neuromuscular, and strength factors have all been proposed as potential causes of this difference. The purpose of this investigation was to determine, through a series of three studies, the magnitude of sex differences, which exist in these potential risk factors. The first study investigated sex differences in anatomical risk factors. Male and female athletes from the Queensland Academy of Sport (Basketball: M = 14; F = 16; Soccer: F = 14) as well as the Men&#8217;s Lions Soccer club (n = 10) were recruited to participate in the study. A physical examination was completed which included: anthropometric measurements; lower extremity alignment measurements such as Q-Angle, knee recurvatum, and foot pronation; knee ligamentous laxity and muscle flexibility measurements; intercondylar notch width measurements using MRI; and an orthopedic examination. Our investigation found that anatomical differences do exist between healthy uninjured male and females. Females had larger Q-Angles, excessive foot pronation, decreased intercondylar notch width and increased ligamentous laxity and muscular flexibility compared to males. However, when examining the likely magnitude of these difference between the sexes, only a moderate effect was found (0.60 &lt; ES &#8804; 1.2). The second study investigated sex differences in strength measures that included knee flexion and extension peak torque values as measured using an isokinetic dynamometer, thigh muscle volume and cross sectional area (CSA) determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and single leg hop for distance. Male and female athletes were recruited from the Queensland Academy of Sport (QAS) basketball program (M= 13; F = 13). Males were found to be significantly stronger than females even when all strength measurements were normalized to account for sex differences in anthropometrics (p &lt; 0.05). Males generated greater peak forces in their knee extensors and flexors, greater hop distances and had larger muscle volumes and maximal cross sectional areas as determined by MRI analysis. When examining the likely magnitude of these difference between the sexes, a moderate to large effect was found (1.00 &lt; ES &#8804; 2.8). The final study investigated sex differences in lower limb neuromuscular factors, viz: body-segmental motions; ground reaction forces; and muscle timing and recruitment patterns in response to a drop-landing task in a laboratory setting. Participants recruited for the study were male and female university students (M= 11, F = 11), currently attending the University of Queensland. Participants performed a drop-landing task that consisted of performing a total of eight vertical drop landings from a box, 40cm in height, onto a force platform. Lower extremity sagittal plane marker kinetics and kinematics for the hip, knee and ankle were collected to determine joint angles at impact of landing and then maximum angle reached, ROM from initial ground contact to maximum angle as well as joint angular velocities. Thigh muscle activation patterns (i.e. recruitment order) in response to the drop-landing task were also collected. Results found that the female group landed with decreased knee flexion angles and higher ground reaction forces per body weight during the impact of landing compared to the males. After initial impact, the females also reached the greatest angles at the hip and knee therefore producing the greatest ROM at these joints. In regards to thigh muscle activation patterns, both male and female groups activated the hamstring muscles, prior to quadriceps activation, a result that was not expected. In conclusion, several anatomical, neuromuscular and strength differences exist between male and female athletes with the greatest differences observed in the kinematic and strength data. Females could potentially best benefit from training programs that include strength and proprioception components as well as technique awareness in an attempt to reduce the current ACL incidence rates observed in female athletes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anterior cruciate ligament, gender, female, risk factors, non-contact, mechanisms, anatomical, hormonal, neuromuscular</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Hubterranean View of Syntax: An Analysis of Linguistic Form through Network Theory</field><field name="creator">Julie Louise Steele</field><field name="description">Language is part of nature, and as such, certain general principles that generate the form of natural systems, will also create the patterns found within linguistic form. Since network theory is one of the best theoretical frameworks for extracting general principles from diverse systems, this thesis examines how a network perspective can shed light on the characteristics and the learning of syntax. It is demonstrated that two word co-occurrence networks constructed from adult and child speech (BNC World Edition 2001; Sachs 1983; MacWhinney 2000a) exhibit three non-atomic syntactic primitives namely, the truncated power law distributions of frequency, degree and the link length between two nodes (the link representing a precedence relation). Since a power law distribution of link lengths characterises a hubterranean structure (Kasturirangan 1999) i.e. a structure that has a few highly connected nodes and many poorly connected nodes, both the adult and the child word co-occurrence networks exhibit hubterranean structure. This structure is formed by an optimisation process that minimises the link length whilst maximising connectivity (Mathias &amp; Gopal 2001 a&amp;b). The link length in a word co-occurrence network is the storage cost of representing two adjacently co-occurring words and is inversely proportion to the transitional probability (TP) of the word pair. Adjacent words that co-occur often together i.e. have a high TP, exhibit a high cohesion and tend to form chunks. These chunks are a cost effective method of storing representations. Thus, on this view, the (multi-) power law of link lengths represents the distribution of storage costs or cohesions within adjacent words. Such cohesions form groupings of linguistic form known as syntactic constituents. Thus, syntactic constituency is not specific to language and is a property derived from the optimisation of the network. In keeping with other systems generated by a cost constraint on the link length, it is demonstrated that both the child and adult word co-occurrence networks are not hierarchically organised in terms of degree distribution (Ravasz and Barab&#225;si 2003:1). Furthermore, both networks are disassortative, and in line with other disassortative networks, there is a correlation between degree and betweenness centrality (BC) values (Goh, Kahng and Kim 2003). In agreement with scale free networks (Goh, Oh, Jeong, Kahng and Kim 2002), the BC values in both networks follow a power law distribution. In this thesis, a motif analysis of the two word co-occurrence networks is a richly detailed (non-functional) distributional analysis and reveals that the adult and child significance profiles for triad subgraphs correlate closely. Furthermore, the most significant 4-node motifs in the adult network are also the most significant in the child network. Utilising this non-functional distributional analysis in a word co-occurrence network, it is argued that the notion of a general syntactic category is not evidenced and as such is inadmissible. Thus, non-general or construction-specific categories are preferred (in line with Croft 2001). Function words tend to be the hub words of the network (see Ferrer i Cancho and Sol&#233; 2001a), being defined and therefore identified by their high type and token frequency. These properties are useful for identifying syntactic categories since function words are traditionally associated with particular syntactic categories (see Cann 2000). Consequently, a function word and thus a syntactic category may be identified by the interception of the frequency and degree power laws with their truncated tails. As a given syntactic category captures the type of words that may co-occur with the function word, the category then encourages consistency within the functional patterns in the network and re-enforces the network&#8217;s (near-) optimised state. Syntax then, on this view, is both a navigator, manoeuvring through the ever varying sea of linguistic form and a guide, forging an uncharted course through novel expression. There is also evidence suggesting that the hubterranean structure is not only found in the word co-occurrence network, but within other theoretical syntactic levels. Factors affecting the choice of a verb that is generalised early relate to the formation and the characteristics of hubs. In that, the property of a high (token) frequency in combination with either a high degree (type frequency) or a low storage cost, point to certain verbs within the network and these highly &#8216;visible&#8217; verbs tend to be generalised early (in line with Boyd and Goldberg forthcoming). Furthermore, the optimisation process that creates hubterranean structure is implicated in the verb-construction subpart network of the adult&#8217;s linguistic knowledge, the mapping of the constructions&#8217; form-to-meaning pairings, the construction inventory size as well as certain strategies aiding first language learning and adult artificial language learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">syntax, network theory, child language, power laws, frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male Risk Taking as a Sexual Display Strategy: Proximal and Distal Explanations for Young Men's Risk Taking</field><field name="creator">Richard Ronay</field><field name="description">This research explores whether male risk taking emerges as a sexual display strategy in the presence of attractive women. Experiments 1 to 3 explored whether young males reported and engaged in more risk taking after viewing pictures of highly attractive females. Possible self-control mechanisms were investigated via working memory, reversal learning, and Stroop tasks. In addition, second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) was measured as a proxy for individual differences in testosterone. Viewing pictures of highly attractive females led to greater self-reported risk-taking. 2D:4D was found to moderate the effect on risk-taking behaviours, with increases for high, but decreases for low testosterone males. Digit ratio also moderated the effects observed on the Stroop and reversal learning tasks. Experiments 4 and 5 extended these findings to examine how power interacts with testosterone to influence risk taking and inhibitory control. As testosterone is as-sociated with the pursuit of power and status (Dabbs &amp; Dabbs, 2000), high testoster-one individuals primed with power were expected to have little reason to disrupt the status quo and thus should be risk-avoidant. Conversely, high-testosterone individuals primed with low power were expected to use risk taking as a vehicle for pursuing po-tential gains to their status and resources. The findings from two experiments are con-sistent with these predictions. In Experiment 1, higher testosterone males (as indicated by second&#8211;fourth digit ratio) showed greater risk-taking when primed with low power. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and also showed that when primed with high power, higher testosterone males took fewer risks. The influence of power on Stroop performance was also moderated by individual differences in testosterone. Par-ticipants primed with high power showed better Stroop performance if they were lower in testosterone, whereas participants primed with low power showed better Stroop performance if they were higher in testosterone. These results suggest that greater executive control accompanies but does not underlie enhanced risk taking, caused by testosterone and power. Finally, results from a field experiment (Experiment 6) with skateboarders demon-strate that physical risk taking by young male skateboarders increases in the presence of an attractive female. This increased risk taking led to more successes but also more crash landings in front of the female observer. Mediational analyses suggest that this increase in risk taking is caused in part by elevated testosterone levels of men who performed in front of the attractive female. In addition, skateboarders&#8217; risk taking was predicted by their performance on a reversal-learning task, reversal-learning perform-ance was disrupted by the presence of the attractive female, and the female&#8217;s presence moderated the observed relationship between risk taking and reversal learning. These results suggest that men use physical risk taking as a sexual display strategy, and they provide suggestive evidence regarding possible hormonal and neural mechanisms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">risk taking, testosterone, 2D:4D, executive control, sexual competition, power</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fat soluble vitamins and function in adults awaiting liver transplantation.</field><field name="creator">Abbott-Johnson, Winsome</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of Targeted Immunotherapy to Treat Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) Post Transplant</field><field name="creator">Andy Hsu</field><field name="description">Interest in cellular immunotherapy has increased with the recognition of the pivotal role that dendritic cells (DC) play in the adaptive immune system. The preparation of DC to present tumour antigens and subsequent induction of tumour specific T cells have been widely documented. This thesis studied the ability of cord blood (CB) stem cells to differentiate into functional CD34+DC, followed by the optimisation of electroporation of RNA into these cells. Total RNA derived from a leukaemic cell line and a primary human leukaemic sample was electroporated into CD34+DC DC and we were able to generate anti-leukaemic cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The CTL specifically targeted leukaemia but not normal cells. While the in vitro data showed promising results of the CTL specificity, a NOD-SCID model of human ALL was established to allow the CTL to be tested in vivo. We established a reproducible model of human ALL in NOD-SCID mouse using four primary human ALL samples. The adoptively transferred anti-leukaemic CTL into the ALL bearing NOD-SCID mice showed that ALL engraftment was significantly delayed. However, the addition of total RNA loaded CD34+DC DC did not enhance the in vivo CTL effect. Lastly, by dissecting the CTL response, we found that the polyclonal CTL were targeting survivin, HM1.24 and CT-7 antigens. The CTL clones generated from these polyclonal CTL showed high specificity for leukaemia but not normal cells. In conclusion, these preliminary data support the use of total RNA electroporated CD34+DC as a means of inducing anti-leukaemic CTL, and have demonstrated the efficacy of the CTL in a NOD-SCID model of ALL. This study has also provided insight into the polyclonal CTL response and future studies will likely continue along this path.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dendritic cells (DCs)</field><field name="subject">immunotherapy</field><field name="subject">acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</field><field name="subject">Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte</field><field name="subject">NOD-SCID</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the structure-property relationships in eumelanin</field><field name="creator">Jacques Bothma</field><field name="description">In this thesis we examine key structure-property relationships associated with eumelanin's photophysical properties. This has involved characterizing both the molecular and supramolecular structure of eumelanin, and examining how these relate to eumalanin's key optical properties that are relevant to their their role in the biosphere as photoprotectants. Using low-voltage high resolution transmission electron microscopy we definitively show that sheets of proto-molecules stack to form nanostructures. The inter-sheet spacings within these structures are between 3.7 and 4.0 &#197; consistent with non-covalent pie-pie stacking in heteroaromatic systems. Stacking interactions in similarly structured aromatic macromolecules play an important role in non-radiative energy dissipation and we propose that this may also be the case in the eumelanin system. We also examine the recently proposed hypothesis that excited state intramolecular proton transfer may play a role in the photophysics of 5,6-dihydoxyindole carboxylic acid, a key eumelanin monomer. The experimental results acquired in this study indicate that this hypothesis needs to be carefully re-examined and its justification would require more extensive experimental support. Key optical properties of 5,6-dihydoxyindole carboxylic acid are re-evaluated in an inert aprotic solvent and these have provided some insight into the electronic structure as well as the rates of radiative and non-radiative decay in this important eumelanin monomer. We go on to show how the structure of eumelanin can be manipulated to produce eumelanin thin films. These films display electrical conductivities comparable with amorphous silicon, as well as a host of other interesting and potentially useful optoelectronic properties. The results show great promise for eumelanin-based applications such as chemi-sensors (in a variety of architectures including organic field effect transistors with chemi-sensitive channels) and bolometric photon detectors.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">02 Physical Sciences</field><field name="subject">eumelanin, spectroscopy, thin films</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gidyea Fire: A Study of the Transformation and Maintenance of Aboriginal Place Properties on the Georgina River</field><field name="creator">Long, Stephen</field><field name="description">In this thesis a platform of knowledge is provided for the development of enhanced Indigenous cultural heritage legislation by examining the specific nature of the cultural heritage of a Queensland Aboriginal group, the Dajarra Aboriginal community of Northwest Queensland for whom the Georgina River is a heartland in their cultural geography. The thesis was conducted during a period when the Queensland Government began to recognize demands for more effective Indigenous cultural heritage legislation. Queensland's latest Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation, introduced in 2004, emerged from a history of legislation dominated by an archaeological model of cultural heritage. However, despite some improvements this new legislation has maintained a physically orientated model of cultural heritage. Therefore Queensland's Indigenous societies, their places, place knowledge and certain types of place-specific behaviours continue to be exposed to imposed change. The thesis examines the 'lifeworld', the 'everyday' experiences of place of the Dajarra community. A broad definition of culture and an interactive model of place, coupled with a phenomenological approach provide a theoretical framework to engage with and describe cultural heritage as Dajarra people themselves experience it. The cultural heritage of Dajarra people involves interactions with a diversity of places and various combinations of behavioural, knowledge and physical properties. All of the places examined were interrelated with other places to form both small and large-scale place complexes. This dissertation reveals that the cultural heritage of an Aboriginal community lies not just in the physical environment but also in the diverse everyday people-environment interactions of that community. Effective cultural heritage legislation must be capable of encompassing this diversity. Cultural heritage is essentially dynamic, it is found in processes of change, it is found in ongoing people-environment interactions as well as those of the past. It is argued that Aboriginal people hold 'active cultural heritage rights'; these are rights to interact with places and rights to control action in places. Ideal cultural heritage legislation would recognize these active rights and provide for Aboriginal control of them, that is, Aboriginal defined and controlled change. This study reveals that it is difficult to separate places in time and space from other places with which they are co-dependent or inextricably intertwined. Studies of Aboriginal people-environment interactions and legislative measures must respond to the broader place complexes within which individual places are embedded and within which the everyday experiences of place are had. It is shown that there is a range of ways that an Aboriginal cultural heritage community can be defined and a range of Aboriginal people that might have interests in the cultural heritage of an area. Lastly, the thesis calls for the adoption of an interactive model of place as a foundation to cultural heritage studies and legislation in order to respond to the cultural heritage of Aboriginal people as they themselves experience it and wish to experience it.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="subject">750309 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander development and welfare</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal cultural heritage</field><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">place theory</field><field name="subject">Dajarra</field><field name="subject">Georgina River</field><field name="subject">people-environment interactions</field><field name="subject">Waluwarra</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal environments</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:8675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Futures of education: Feminist and post-Western critiques and visions</field><field name="creator">Milojevic, I.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330199 Education Studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">749904 Education across cultures</field><field name="subject">330104 Educational Policy, Administration and Management</field><field name="subject">749906 Education policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105991</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a sociology of youth in new times</field><field name="creator">Mcgregor, G.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">749999 Education and training not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young people, physical education, and transition: Understanding practices in the middle years of schooling</field><field name="creator">Hunter, Lisa Ther&#233;s&#232;</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106049</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making a difference from differences: Culturally heterogeneous workgroups need leaders with conflict and emotions management skills</field><field name="creator">Ayoko, O.B.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350200 Business and Management</field><field name="subject">720400 Management and Productivity Issues</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combinatorial methods in drug design: towards Modulating protein-protein Interactions</field><field name="creator">Long, Stephen M.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">230101 Mathematical Logic, Set Theory, Lattices And Combinatorics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Aetiology of Childhood Depression</field><field name="creator">Hallam, D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">730211 Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parenting and family support in primary care setting</field><field name="creator">Turner, Karen Mary Thomas</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380107 Health, Clinical and Counselling Psychology</field><field name="subject">730204 Child health</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The initiation of autoimmune reactions in anticonvulsant drug-induced hypersensitivity: The role of cytochrome P450 enzymes</field><field name="creator">Kinobe, R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320504 Toxicology (incl.

Both investigate the abstract organization of phenomena, independent of their substance, type, or spatial or temporal scale of existence. The focus of the research has been on giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. They constitute &lt;0.001% of the total number of deposits yet contain 70-85% of the world's metal resources. Giants are the definitive exploration targets. They are more profitable to exploit and less susceptible to fluctuations of the market. Consensus has it that the same processes that generate small deposits also form giants but those processes are simply longer, vaster, and larger. Heat is the dominant factor in the genesis of giant mineral deposits. A paleothermal map shows where the vast heat required to generate a giant has been concentrated in a large space, and even allows us to deduce the duration of the process. To generate a paleothermal map acceptable to the scientific community requires reproducibility. Experimentation with various approaches to pattern recognition of geochemical data showed that the AUTOCLUST algorithm not only gave reproducibility but also gave the most consistent, most meaningful results. It automatically extracts boundaries based on Voronoi and Delaunay tessellations. The user does not specify parameters; however, the modeller does have tools to explore the data. This approach is near ideal in that it removes much of the human-generated bias. This algorithm reveals the radial, spatial distribution, of gold deposits in the Lachlan Fold Belt of southeastern Australia at two distinct scales &#8211; repeating patterns every ~80 km and ~230 km. Both scales of patterning are reflected in the geology. The ~80 km patterns are nested within the ~230 km patterns revealing a self-similar, geometrical relationship. It is proposed that these patterns originate from Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle. At the Rayleigh Number appropriate for the mantle, the stable planform is the spoke pattern, where hot mantle material is moving upward near the centre of the pattern and outward along the radial arms. Discontinuities in the mantle, Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection in the mantle, and the spatial distribution of giant mineral deposits, are correlative. The discontinuities in the Earth are acting as platforms from which Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection can originate. Shallow discontinuities give rise to plumelets, which manifest at the crust as repeating patterns ranging, from ~100 to ~1,000 km in diameter. Deeper discontinuities give rise to plumes, which become apparent at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;1,000 to ~4,000 km in diameter. The deepest discontinuities give rise to the superplumes, which become detectable at the crust as repeating patterns ranging from &gt;4,000 to &gt;10,000 km in diameter. Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection concentrates the reservoir of heat in the mantle into specific locations in the crust; thereby providing the vast heat requirements for the processes that generate giant, hydrothermal mineral deposits. The radial spatial distribution patterns observed for gold deposits are also present for base metal deposits. At the supergiant Broken Hill deposit in far western New South Wales, Australia, the higher temperature Broken Hill-type deposits occur in a radial pattern while the lower temperature deposits occur in concentric patterns. The supergiant Broken Hill deposit occurs at the very centre of the pattern. If the supergiant Broken Hill Deposit was buried beneath alluvium, water or younger rocks, it would now be possible to predict its location with accuracy measured in tens of square kilometres. This predictive accuracy is desired by every exploration manager of every exploration company. The giant deposits at Broken Hill, Olympic Dam, and Mount Isa all occur on the edge of an annulus. There are at least two ways of creating an annulus on the Earth's surface. One is through Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection and the other is through meteor impact. It is likely that only 'large' meteors (those &gt;10 km in diameter) would have any permanent impact on the mantle. Lesser meteors would leave only a superficial scar that would be eroded away. The permanent scars in the mantle act as &#8216;accidental templates&#8217; consisting of concentric and possibly radial fractures that impose those structures on any rocks that were subsequently laid down or emplaced over the mantle. In southeastern Australia, the proposed Deniliquin Impact structure has been an 'accidental template' providing a 'line-of-least-resistance' for the ascent of the ~2,000 km diameter, offshore, Cape Howe Plume. The western and northwestern radial arms of this plume have created the very geometry of the Lachlan Fold Belt, as well as giving rise to the spatial distribution of the granitic rocks in that belt and ultimately to the gold deposits. The interplay between the templating of the mantle by meteor impacts and the ascent of plumelets, plumes or superplumes from various discontinuities in the mantle is quite possibly the reason that mineral deposits occur where they do.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">269900 Other Earth Sciences</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">giant ore deposits</field><field name="subject">multifractal</field><field name="subject">mineral deposit model</field><field name="subject">Complexity Theory</field><field name="subject">Lachlan Fold Belt</field><field name="subject">General Systems Theory</field><field name="subject">Rayleigh-B&#233;nard convection</field><field name="subject">Broken Hill Deposit</field><field name="subject">Olympic Dam Deposit</field><field name="subject">Mount Isa Deposit</field><field name="subject">deterministic chaos</field><field name="subject">nonlinear dynamics</field><field name="subject">paleothermal</field><field name="subject">plumes</field><field name="subject">temporal</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="subject">fractal</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:107702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Urban Growth in the Process of Impoverishment of Campesinos&#8217; Households Living in Peri-Urban Areas: A Case Study in Mexico City</field><field name="creator">Yadira Mireya M&#233;ndez de Mart&#237;nez</field><field name="description">In the last 50 years, Mexico, like many other countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, has experienced accelerated urban growth. Urban growth has been accompanied by an increase in urban poverty. While the spatial distribution of poverty in urban areas in Mexico is varied, new settlements that tend to grow in the peri-urban hinterland of cities are largely associated with poverty. This is because inexpensive, but mostly illegal, agricultural land (ejido or private) has been alienated to satisfy the demands of low income population for housing. The focus of this study lay in the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City (MAMC), which is the habitat of diverse low-income groups. Among those groups are the campesinos (people with rural background engaged totally or partially in agricultural livelihoods). Some studies have suggested that campesinos are very vulnerable to urban growth, since population expansion has put severe pressure on their agricultural land, which, despite its marginal value, is used to produce crops for either semi-commercialisation or subsistence. Although such research has showed how poor campesinos have engaged in non-agricultural activities to make a living and how land and their communities are threatened by urban growth due to speculative pressures on land and/or environmental deterioration, little is known about the impact of urban growth in the process of impoverishment of campesinos living in peri-urban areas. This study aims to understand how the growth of the MAMC affects poverty in campesinos&#8217; households, in order to recommend directions for poverty reduction. Three villages in Chalco municipality, which is situated in the peri-urban fringe of Mexico City, were selected as the study area. Based on the development of a conceptual framework, this study considered three interconnected elements underpinning poverty: multi-dimensionality, complexity and dynamism. For this reason, the Sustainable Livelihoods approach was selected as an analytical tool, as it provided a flexible analytical framework that encompasses all those elements. The study is divided in three stages. In the first stage (namely documental investigation), a series of published and unpublished written materials were reviewed to determine how the growth of the MAMC transformed the nature and availability of resources in Chalco municipality from 1970 to 2000. This stage was followed by the empirical investigation that aimed to examine how those transformations affected campesinos&#8217; assets (human, natural, physical, productive and social), the strategies they used to adapt to such changes, and how they perceived changes in poverty status. Accordingly, for this stage, quantitative and qualitative longitudinal and cross-sectional data were collected from 110 campesinos&#8217; households living in the study area in 1997 and 2003 by using structured questionnaires. Qualitative data were also collected by using semi-structured interviews from 34 campesinos&#8217; households in 2000. The final stage, called recommendations, involved the synthesis of the results of the documental and empirical investigations and suggests a series of directions for poverty reduction in campesinsos&#8217; households in the study area. The documental and empirical investigations revealed that changes in asset ownership, between 1997 to 2003, depended on both transformation in the nature and availability of resources in Chalco and intra-household organization. Fundamental transformations in socio-demographic, economic, natural, physical and political/organisational resources of Chalco municipality were mainly, but not exclusively, associated with the growth of the MAMC. Climatic and physical characteristics of Chalco were also evident. To respond to such changes, campesinos implemented a series of strategies to get access to resources. Such strategies were based on campesinos&#8217; needs, priorities and the portfolio of assets available, and their functionality. It was clear that campesinos depleted some existing assets to acquire urban assets and preserve their rural assets. In some instances, such strategies led campesinos&#8217; families to satisfy their basic needs and, therefore, perceive themselves as non-poor. However, in other instances, such strategies prevented families from meeting their needs, leading them to the perception of being poor. The recommendation was made that in order to reduce poverty among campesinos in the study area, it was necessary to identify different alternatives to support their urban and rural assets and certain of their strategies that improve the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities and mitigate constraints to meeting their goals.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">peri-urban</field><field name="subject">sustainable livelihoods</field><field name="subject">poverty dynamics</field><field name="subject">Urban growth</field><field name="subject">adaptive strategies</field><field name="subject">Metropolitan Area of Mexico City</field><field name="subject">Campesinos</field><field name="subject">Chalco municipality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:120634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and forecasting cultural and environmental changes</field><field name="creator">Sinay, Laura</field><field name="description">Much of the discourse on cultural change has been descriptive and explanatory, with few attempts to be predictive. Where indicators of and buffers to change are identified, they tend only to be post-event assessable. The need for a tool with strong predictive power is fundamental to cultural (and environmental) impact assessment and the rationale behind this developmental work. Focusing on traditional cultures and their environmental context, and based on a case study of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, Brasil, this research advances knowledge on modelling cultural and environmental changes, and how to manage these changes for accepted goals. A heuristic tool is presented for assessing the impacts of pressures on a culture and its related environment as well as the efficacy of management responses. This tool is associated with methods to assist in developing predictive models representing the change processes. The change model building process involves consulting stakeholders as a way of integrating different perceptions, to identify pressures, responses and links associated with cultural and environmental change. This assists in creating a co-learning environment, which facilitates communication between stakeholders. The change modelling approach permits incorporation of the complexity and uncertainty of the system represented, and enables scenario analyses. These allow expected local and flow-on impacts of management interventions to be tested. This approach is more efficient than stand-alone performance indicators that do not allow for the synergic impacts of management interventions to be observed and assessed. Using the models representing the cultural and environmental change processes of the Cai&#231;aras of the Juatinga Ecological Reserve, this research identifies that tourism is a major pressure for change (at that locality). This study also identified that tourist numbers at new and small tourism destinations, as well as on a continental scale, can be forecast using exponential and polynomial functions. Yet, tourism flow may be perturbed at any given time by, for example, acts of violence and when the type of marketing changes. In addition, tourist numbers cannot be greater than the total population, therefore it cannot grow indefinitely as exponential and polynomial functions suggest. Hence, the use of exponential and polynomial functions to forecast tourist numbers is more reliable for short periods, such as four or five years, and when based on six or more sets of data points. The greatest contribution of this research to the cultural change discourse is its innovative approach to study, forecast and manage cultural and environmental changes. The continuation of this research may lead to identifying general theories relating pressures and responses to indicators of cultural and environmental changes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">350500 Tourism</field><field name="subject">cultural changes</field><field name="subject">environmental changes</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">protected areas</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">belief network</field><field name="subject">Cai&#231;aras</field><field name="subject">environmental reserves</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:120834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon sequestration in native rainforest tree plantations</field><field name="creator">Richards, A.</field><field name="description">The recent rapid decline in tropical and subtropical forests and subsequent loss of biodiversity, coupled to the threat posed by climate change, has led to a requirement for sustainable forest systems. Large-scale monocultures supply timber that can no longer be harvested in sufficient quantity from natural forests in subtropical and tropical regions. However, there is a general perception that forest systems need to be managed to provide multiple production and environmental services, including carbon (C) sequestration, restoration of soil fertility, and biodiversity. Overall, traditional plantation monocultures cannot meet all of these new objectives, and native and mixed-species plantations may provide an alternative, when provision of ecosystem services, besides timber, becomes a priority. The objective of this thesis was twofold. Firstly to assess C storage in native rainforest tree (hoop pine, Araucaria cunninghamii) plantations, planted as monocultures in subtropical Australia. Plantations were examined to evaluate their potential as a sustainable forest system for provision of high-value timber products and C sinks. The second objective was to contrast the traditional monoculture system with a multi-species system, and a mixed-species rainforest tree plantation was studied. These systems are receiving substantial attention from private forest growers as they could provide economic benefits, including greater productivity, coupled to biologically desirable outcomes, such as higher biodiversity. The focus of the second objective was to improve the design of mixtures for maximum wood production and C sequestration, so that other ecological benefits could be realised. Subtropical native hoop pine monocultures did not store soil C into long-term storage pools as rapidly as adjacent native rainforest or pastures. In addition, substantial amounts of soil nitrogen were lost from tree plantations, indicating that with current management, these systems may not be sustainable in the long-term. Overall, total C storage, including soil and aboveground biomass C, was higher in tree plantations than pastures highlighting the potential of native tree plantations for C sequestration. The mechanisms behind lower soil C storage of native hoop pine plantations, compared with rainforest and pasture, may be related to differences in soil C stabilization. While native forest and pasture systems stored C within soil aggregates and through organo-mineral interactions, tree plantations did not show a strong aggregate hierarchy and most soil C was associated with mineral-sized particles. Because soil minerals have a limited capacity to adsorb soil organic C, they may limit the C storage capacity of the studied tree plantations. We conclude that changes to management of hoop pine monocultures, such as increasing plant diversity in tree plantations, may create conditions similar to the native forest and promote greater C sequestration in plantation soils by stabilization through both soil aggregation and organomineral interactions. Since traditional monoculture forest production systems may not provide the multiple benefits needed for sustainable forestry, an alternative mixed-species tree plantation was investigated. We examined the dominant paradigm that mixtures of two fast growing species (Grevillea robusta and Elaeocarpus angustifolius) compete for site resources, while mixtures of shade tolerant (Castanospermum australe) and shade intolerant (G. robusta or E. angustifolius) species are complementary. Contrary to predictions, there was evidence for complementary interactions between the fast-growing species in terms of nutrient uptake, nutrient use efficiency and nutrient cycling. Preliminary model simulations of interactions between species for light indicated that G. robusta maintained the highest rates of photosynthesis under different light conditions and may be combined with C. australe and the more light demanding E. angustifolius in mixtures. Overall there was evidence for tree species combinations which could potentially sequester more C, in addition to other benefits including higher biodiversity and improved use of soil resources, in mixed-species plantations. Such knowledge is useful to encourage implementation of these new timber production systems.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300600 Forestry Sciences</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environmental systems analysis as an aid to policy development, application and auditing</field><field name="creator">Hill, R. J.</field><field name="description">Environmental management in modern industry entails much more than simply measuring the level of contaminants at the discharge point of a chimney stack or pipeline and operating within defined licence limits. It involves: 1) Understanding the environmental risks associated with the industrial operation; 2) Quantifying the environmental assets at risk; 3) Evaluating the environmental challenge from the industry (determining the likely effect of particular emission levels on different environments); 4) Monitoring the condition of environmental assets in response to this challenge; 5) Devising appropriate remedial action where necessary. This study aimed to provide a rigorous and effective framework for decision making concerning vegetated landscapes surrounding industrial premises, particularly those associated with emissions of pollutants to air. Three Alcoa of Australia managed facilities in Victoria were used to develop and test the procedures, namely a coastal site at Point Henry, Geelong, a hinterland forest and heath site at Anglesea and a coastal heath site at Portland. The three facilities were involved in the aluminium smelting industry and the major atmospheric emissions were gaseous and particulate fluorides and sulfur dioxide. Analyses of vegetation distribution and condition were undertaken in order to establish whether the industrial activities at the three sites could be identified as the causes of changes in vegetation. A geographic information system (GIS) was implemented at each facility, to contain cadastral information as well as records of the physical environment and plant and animal species occurrences and condition, where appropriate. The GIS was used to create a surface of vegetation condition over the area of interest at the time of assessment and then over time to evaluate vegetation change and relationship to meteorological and production data. Baseline vegetation condition was established for each facility using large-scale high quality aerial photography and multi-spectral imagery. The photography for each site contained large amounts of latent information on vegetation distribution and condition. When properly rectified and geo-referenced, the images became accessible and open to manipulation within the GIS. At each of the three sites investigated, image classes were selected that provided appropriate detail for the vegetation type. In effect the image became a surrogate of the vegetation frozen in time and space. The ability to extract information on past vegetation condition was shown to be a very valuable asset providing the opportunity to generate new contemporaneous data to augment poor or lost historical data. The process was illustrated by developing vegetation change maps and trend information using past and current photography and limited historical field data. A verified emission model was applied to two of the facilities (Anglesea and Portland) to predict emission effects over the vegetated areas. These were used to evaluate current vegetation condition and change in terms of industrial challenge and other change agencies known or suspected. In each case, further developments of the model were required in order to achieve acceptable predictions of known atmospheric and air pollutant conditions. The investigations at Anglesea demonstrated the importance of fine-scale topographic description and meteorological modelling in order to reconcile modelled and observed environmental conditions in hilly coastal terrain. At Portland, the study revealed the importance of marine aerosols in the distribution and deposition of fluoride in the vicinity of the source. Within the broad framework of vegetation type and general condition at Anglesea and Portland, differences at the micro-scale of individual plants and clumps of plants were examined using multi-spectral imagery. Here differences in image characteristics that related to increased pigmentation and loss of chlorophyll in leaves and increased amounts of dead tissue on plants were evaluated. The change agents for the detected differences within sets and between sets of imagery were analysed and again shown to be mainly non-industrial. Only at Portland did atmospheric emissions from the aluminium smelter play a role at some locations, and then only because the effect was being reinforced by other factors (lack of burning and drought). At Portland, population data for associated fauna and an orchid were examined in relation to the baseline vegetation condition, vegetation change and industrial impact. The distribution and welfare of these species were shown to be generally dependent on vegetation condition and other non-industrial factors. If the vegetation overall was maintained in a condition of vigorous growth and structural diversity, it could be expected that specific dependant flora and fauna would thrive within it. The exception was the orchid, which was shown to be sensitive to emissions and could only thrive in its natural habitat in the vicinity of the smelter if protected by screening vegetation or nurtured by an intensive set of cultural practices that were developed as a result of this study.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">300800 Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">300801 Environmental Management and Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Alcoa</field><field name="subject">Portland</field><field name="subject">pollution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren).

It also studies the phe- nomenon of optical power limiting which utilizes self-focusing e ects. As an analytical tool, a mode decomposition method which uses an orthogonal and complete set of Gaussian-Laguerre modes as a basis set is used to treat these problems. Nonlinear media both in the thin and thick limits are investigated. For thin media, a closed form expression is derived which describes the optical eld of an initally Gaussian beam that is perturbed by a thin nonlinear material which exhibits nonlinear absorption as well as nonlinear refraction. This result is valid for any regime of nonlinearity in the thin medium approximation. Thick media are treated using a numerical extension of the Gaussian-Laguerre Mode Decomposition technique. Spatial scanning techniques such as the Z-scan that rely on self-focusing e ects and that are used to measure the nonlinear optical parameters of a material are studied in detail. Optical limiting in both thick and thin media is also investigated.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonlinear self-focusing</field><field name="subject">Gaussian-Laguerre Mode Decomposition</field><field name="subject">Optical limiting</field><field name="subject">Z-scan</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:189375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum.

While this observation has never been entirely unchallenged, it is now broadly accepted within the discipline that while party alignment is still a significant factor, dealignment is gradually occurring. One consequence of the decline of party alignment is that the discipline of electoral analysis must seek new theories and models to explain the activity of those voters who do not vote in accordance with party alignment. A number of explanations have been advanced, including &#8220;issue voting&#8221;, based upon voters making rational judgments on contemporary policy issues; and &#8220;image voting&#8221;, based primarily upon the public relations image of the party and leader. One theory which has been advanced to explain a proportion of the vote in a limited number of Queensland electorates is connectional politics. Connectionalism occurs where a candidate, regardless of their party label or independence, obtains electoral support on a personal basis as a result of their position within, and &#8220;connections&#8221; within, the community. This position of leadership must be developed over a long time, and it is suggested that the strength of the relationship between the community leader and the community can, under some circumstances, be translated into electoral support.The concept was first described by Reynolds in Connectional Politics &#8211; The Queensland Case.1 This paper described a series of occurrences of connectional politics, but did not endeavour to explore the mechanics of connectional politics. It introduced the concept, but left the way open for further work to explore how, and under what circumstances, connectionalism can be effective. This thesis undertakes some of that further work, in an effort to describe the operations of connectional politics. This research extracts from Reynolds&#8217; paper a series of &#8220;connectional indicators&#8221; related to the candidate, the community, and the electoral circumstances, then tests those indicators in five substantial case studies, observing potentially connectional candidates in various campaigns in the 1992, 1995, 1998 and 2001 state general elections. The result of this research is first, confirmation that connectional politics in Queensland does occur, supporting Reynolds&#8217; initial contention. Second, however, this research identifies some important factors which contribute to a successful connectional campaign. The results of this research indicate that connectional politics occurs most readily in communities which consider themselves to be in need of instrumental services which must be provided by the central government. This sense of need is often coupled with a sense of neglect; a perception that the central government is neglecting the important needs of the community. In order for these needs to be realised, the community requires a &#8220;champion&#8221; whose primary purpose is to enter state politics in order to ensure that the state government provides support for the community&#8217;s self-identified needs. Such a &#8220;champion&#8221; is usually a person who is already a leader within the local community. They may, for instance, have served in local government, or taken leadership positions in local associations. This research suggests that if such a leader emerges, and if the core of his/her campaign is their desire to overcome the &#8220;neglect&#8221; shown by the central government, they can obtain significant electoral support regardless of their party label (or lack thereof). This conclusion is important, but carries a number of important caveats. The first is that this research is based upon five case studies. The studies were undertaken in some depth, and provide a stable foundation for the research conclusions, but they are still only five in number. This research will become stronger if studies such as these are undertaken by future researchers, during future elections. Second, the operation of connectionalism is constrained by circumstances. The community must have the necessary characteristics; the candidate must exhibit the necessary characteristics of leadership and community commitment; and the wider electoral circumstances must be amenable to the operation of connectional politics.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1606 Political Science</field><field name="subject">Politics - Queensland</field><field name="subject">Regional areas</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:196835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Duncan McNab's mission to the Queensland Aborigines, 1875-1880</field><field name="creator">Mark Cryle</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">210301 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander History</field><field name="subject">210303 Australian History (excl.

The presence in the nearby Cenozoic sediments of the Lake Frome basin of uranium mineralisations (Beverley deposit) and the recent discovery of the Four Mile deposit has triggered the interest of explorers. Based on extensive laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) U-Pb geochronological data and mineralogy of U-Th-bearing minerals, rock geochemistry and petrography, we present a global study on the mobility of U, Th and REE in the Mount Painter Domain, including a detailed reconstitution of the Beverley deposit genesis. Seven significant stages of U-Th-REE mobility are recognised: 1. The possible presence U-enriched ~1600 Ma lower crust under the MPD 2. Intrusion of two A-type Mesoproterozoic granites suites (~1575, and ~1560 Ma respectively) with high HFSE contents and crustal origin; the porphyritic biotite K-rich highly-enriched Yerila granite belongs to the youngest suite and hosts magmatic allanite-(Ce), potassic-hastingsite, ilmenite, fergusonite-(Y), chevkinite, molybdenite, zircon, uranothorite, uraninite and titanite and fluorite 3. Late-magmatic or post-magmatic metasomatism in the same granites; evidenced by F-rich annite, zircon, Y-bearing Al-F-titanite (&lt; 6 kbar, &gt;400&#176;C), Y-rich fluorapatite, synchysite-(Ce) and fluorite. Early ilmenite, molybdenite, allanite-(Ce) and oligoclase reacted with an alkaline oxidising F-rich melt or fluid. The latemagmatic to post-magmatic metasomatism is also recorded at the intrusion contact in regional rocks, forming allanite-, magnetite-, uranothorite-, zircon- (1501 &#177; 6 Ma), and uraninite-bearing calcsilicate skarns. The spreading of zircon ages in the Yerila granite (~1565 to ~1521) relates to the mixing of magmatic and metasomatic crystals. 4. the MPD was subject to the Delamerian orogeny and related metamorphism (amphibolite facies); most Mesoproterozoic granitic assemblages present signs of recrystallisation or stress; recrystallisation of monazite-(Ce) and xenotime-(Y) during Paleozoic (Cambrian) (490-495 Ma). U-Th-rich minerals also bear Delamerian ages (polycrase-(Y), euxenite-(Y), davidite-(La) and uraninite). 5. Anatexis of local basement during Ordovician and generation of peraluminous granite (British Empire granite) with low Th/U. The granite is enriched in U and Y. We provide the first robust ages on it: 456 &#177; 9 and 459 &#177; 9 Ma on zircon, 453.3 &#177; 4.6 on xenotime-(Y). 6. Very active hydrothermal/pegmatitic uranium remobilisation along active faults; brannerite-quartz veins formation (367 &#177; 13 Ma), further signs of remobilisation or hydrothermal event during Permian (284 &#177; 25 Ma in thorite) and around the Mt Gee (~290 Ma radiogenic gain in davidite) which agrees with the previous data (paleomagnetic ages of 250-300 Ma). 7. Cenozoic supergene uranium remobilisation in MPD and migration of U-rich oxidised groundwaters into the Lake Frome. The uranium is precipitated in the sandy formation of the lake and in the top layer of the underlying organic-matter-rich clays and silts. The micro-environment of reduction efficiently trap U but also REE, fingerprinting the REE-rich MPD granite source. Coffinite and carnotite give concordant Pliocene ages (6.7 to 3.4 Ma). Provenance studies on the sands hosting the Beverley mineralisations suggest a reworking of Early Cretaceous glacial or glacio-lacustrine sediments originally sourced in Eastern Australia (Lachlan Fold Belt). The youngest recorded zircon (130 Ma) doesn&#8217;t constrain the sediment age but refines the provenance region (New England Orogen).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology; geochronology; Mount Painter; zircon; Beverley Mine; mineralisations; uranium; thorium; rare earth elements</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of potato starch and sonicated return activated sludge as alternative carbon sources for biological nitrogen removal.</field><field name="creator">Kuncoro, Gideon Bani</field><field name="description">High nitrogen discharge from the municipal wastewater is a major concern for the South Australian Government, primarily due to negative impacts on the marine environment. Therefore, under the South Australian Environmental Improvement Program, (SA EIP), all metropolitan wastewater treatment plants have been reconfigured to achieve enhanced nitrogen removal. Secondary treatment (denitrification process) at the metropolitan wastewater treatment plants must be optimised to meet the discharge guideline of 10 mg/L total nitrogen. However, secondary treatment at some plants is carbon limited (low C/N ratio), and external carbon supplementation is required to meet this discharge guideline. Molasses provides the current external carbon source at two plants. It is relatively inexpensive, but other carbon sources, particularly industrial waste streams, may be more attractive, due to the potentially lower material cost, as it is practically free, and environmentally friendly. Potato starch and sonicated return activated sludge (RAS) were considered. In this study, the bioavailability of the soluble carbon in potato starch and ultrasound treated RAS were assessed. The associated objective was to investigate the potential of both carbon sources as an external carbon donor for the denitrification zone of wastewater treatment plants to economically improve biological nitrogen removal. The economic analysis was performed using mainly United States dollars and the fixed capital investments and total capital costs were converted to Australian dollars. This was due to the United States dollars currency quotes obtained for the materials and unit operations required. SCOD from the three sources was quantified and preliminary results were presented. Molasses provided the highest SCOD release of 1.1285 x 10&#8310; mg-SCOD/L, sonicated RAS produced 5.6 to 68.4 times the SCOD release of the untreated RAS (35.6 mg-SCOD/L) depending on the ultrasound intensity and treatment time, while the highest soluble carbon release obtained using potato starch was 809 mg-SCOD/L (using 20.9 g/100 mL potato starch concentration). Based on the experimental SCOD results, batch denitrification tests using the proposed carbon sources were carried out. The nitrogen removal efficiency at low dose (12.48 mg-SCOD/L) using molasses, potato starch and sonicated RAS were 77.54%, 57.24%, and 72.76% respectively, whilst at high dose (124.80 mg-SCOD/L) were 94.04%, 66.32%, and 92.10% correspondingly. In similar order of the proposed carbon sources, the nitrate removal rates for the first phase denitrification with low dose were 1.44, 1.16, and 1.18 mg-NO&#8323; &#8722; /h respectively, whilst the nitrate removal rate of the first phase denitrification with high dose improved to 2.01, 1.26, and 1.96 mg-NO&#8323; &#8722;/h correspondingly. From the denitrification test results, molasses proved to be the optimal carbon source in terms of nitrate removal. However sonicated RAS possesses similar denitrification performance and may be a suitable alternative. An economic analysis for sonicated RAS Option 2 confirmed it as the most viable substitute. The time to recover the initial investment (payback period) is approximately 6.5 years and the breakeven point is approximately 8 years. Both denitrification tests and economic analyses demonstrate that sonicated RAS may be a viable and attractive substitute for the molasses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">denitrification; sonication; RAS; return activated sludge; molasses; ultrasound treatment; potato starch; carbon source; soluble chemical; oxygen demand; wastewater treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early life stages of the southern sea garfish, Hyporhamphus Melanochir (Valenciennes 1846), and their association with seagrass beds.</field><field name="creator">Noell, Craig J</field><field name="description">This study investigates early life stages of the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir) and their association with seagrass in Gulf St Vincent, South Australia. The overall aims were to identify and describe the early life stages of H. melanochir and to explore the possible relationship(s) between these life stages and seagrass habitat with the emphasis on seagrass as a requirement for spawning or as a food source. The reproductive biology of female H. melanochir from the commercial fishery was assessed by microscopic examination of ovaries, oocyte size distributions, gonadosomatic indices, and macroscopic ovarian stages. Five stages of oocyte development were identified and described: perinucleolar, yolk vesicle, yolk globule, migratory nucleus and hydrated. A coherence between histological and whole oocyte descriptions is demonstrated. Hyporhamphus melanochir are characterised as multiple spawners with group-synchronous oocyte development and indeterminate fecundity. A protracted spawning season from October to March was indicated by the occurrence of ripe ovaries and increases in gonadosomatic index. Females reach sexual maturity at 193 mm standard length, and batch fecundity ranged from 201-3044 oocytes depending on fish size. Spawning shoals are segregated by sex, as indicated by commercial samples, with a biased female-to-male ratio of 4.5:1 during the spawning season (1.2:1 during the non-spawning season). In addition, features of the oocyte surface were closely examined, which revealed that the filaments on the chorion of the hydrated oocyte are adhesive. These adhesive filaments presumably allow the fertilised egg to become attached to vegetative substrate by adhesion and/or entanglement. H. melanochir larvae were discriminated from another hemiramphid species, river garfish (H. regularis), which is also known to occur in the study area, based on species-specific amplification of part of the mitochondrial control region using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The species were easily discerned by the number and distinct sizes of PCR products [H. melanochir, 443 bp; river garfish (H. regularis), 462 and 264 bp]. Although based on a single gene, this molecular method will correctly identify the species of individuals in at least 96% and 94% of tests for H. melanochir and H. regularis, respectively. Subsequent to verifying the identification of species by molecular discrimination, the larval development of H. melanochir and H. regularis were described. Larvae of H. melanochir and H. regularis had completed notochord flexion at hatching and are characterized by their elongate body with distinct rows of melanophores along the dorsal, lateral and ventral surfaces; small to moderate head; heavily pigmented, long straight gut; persistent preanal finfold; and extended lower jaw. Fin formation occurs in the sequence: caudal, dorsal and anal (almost simultaneously), pectoral, pelvic. Despite the similarities between both species and among hemiramphid larvae in general, H. melanochir larvae are distinguishable from H. regularis by: having 58-61 vertebrae (v. 51-54 for H. regularis); having 12-15 melanophore pairs in longitudinal rows along the dorsal margin between the head and origin of the dorsal fin (v. 19-22 for H. regularis); and the absence of a large ventral pigment blotch anteriorly on the gut and isthmus (present in H. regularis). A logistic regression analysis of body measurements also revealed interspecies differences in the combined measurements of eye diameter and pre-anal fin length. Both species can be distinguished from morphologically similar larvae found in southern Australia (other hemiramphids and a scomberosocid) by differences in meristic counts and pigmentation. Hyporhamphus melanochir larvae were successfully collected throughout Gulf St Vincent using a neuston net; however, attempts to sample eggs were unsuccessful. Abundances of larvae in the gulf averaged 4.8 and 12.3 larvae 1000&#8315; &#178; of surface water in December 1998 and December 2000, respectively. Larvae exhibit fast growth, as indicated by otolith growth increments, with backcalculated spawning dates falling within the October-March spawning season. Spatial analysis of larval distributions revealed a positive spatial autocorrelation, i.e. non-randomness or clustering of similar abundance values. Most larvae were found in the upper region of the gulf, and the prevalence of seagrass habitat throughout this region supports the view that the demersal eggs of H. melanochir become attached to seagrass and/or algae following spawning. A gyre in waters of the upper gulf, influenced by prevailing southerly winds, the Coriolis effect, and land boundaries, may explain retention of larvae. The importance of seagrass beds to H. melanochir spawning is also supported by anecdotal evidence and available literature on eggs of other Beloniformes, which are also demersal and attach to marine plants. Dual stable isotope analysis (&#948;&#185;&#179; and &#948;&#185;&#8309;N) of larval, juvenile and adult H. melanochir and several potential food sources from the Bay of Shoals was carried out to estimate the importance of zosteracean seagrass towards the assimilated diet of H. melanochir. Although the diet of H. melanochir larvae is probably planktonivorous, their isotopic signatures partly reflect the parental diet due to the influence of pre&amp;ndash;existing tissue in addition to growth. According to mixing model calculations, the signatures of juveniles can be explained by a diet consisting of 23&amp;ndash;37% Zostera, 0&amp;ndash;10% Halophila and the remainder zooplankton, whilst the diet of adults consists of 53&amp;ndash;58% Zostera and the remainder zooplankton. These findings indicate an increasing dependence upon Zostera with growth of H. melanochir. The results of this study enhance the completeness of our understanding of the fisheries biology and ecology of H. melanochir. Significant contributions are provided in reproductive biology and larval biology, seagrass beds (in combination with mixed algae) are demonstrated to be an important habitat for spawning, and Zostera seagrass is shown to be a necessary food source in the diet of juveniles and adults.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">garfish, gars, larvae, seagrasses</field><field name="subject">Fishes Breeding South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Seagrasses Australia South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Strawberry powdery mildew: epidemiology and the effect of host nutrition on disease.</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Sarah A.</field><field name="description">Knowledge of disease epidemiology and the impact of plant nutrient status on development of disease is fundamental in establishing effective management strategies for crop pathogens such as Podosphaera aphanis Br. (Braun et al., 2002), the causal agent of powdery mildew on strawberries. The following study investigated the conditions conducive for powdery mildew in strawberry crops in South Australia, the effect of foliar concentration of potassium and calcium on yield and pathogen development on the strawberry cultivars Aromas (resistant to powdery mildew) and Selva (susceptible), the potential for use of foliar-applied potassium silicate to control disease and identification of genes differentially expressed during disease. Meteorological conditions associated with establishment of powdery mildew were observed over three consecutive seasons in commercial strawberry crops grown in Woodside, South Australia. Conducive conditions appear to be &gt;28 oC, &lt;55 % relative humidity (RH) with no rain during the day (for conidiation), followed by a night with &gt;10 oC, &gt;90 % RH and no rain (for germination). Colony development was then promoted by days of &gt;15 oC and &lt;70 % RH, with nights of &gt;8 oC, &gt;80 % RH and less than 2 mm rain in every 24 hour period. These are consistent with epidemiological studies of this pathogen (Peries, 1962a; Jhooty and McKeen, 1964; Mukerji, 1968; Perera and Wheeler, 1975; Byrne et al, 2000; Miller et al, 2003; Blanco et al, 2004; Davik and Honne, 2005; Amsalem et al, 2006). This knowledge may facilitate prediction of times considered high risk for establishment of powdery mildew in strawberry crops. Subsequently, this may allow optimisation of fungicide application and improved management of this disease and reduced yield loss and management expenses. P. aphanis developed at an increased rate on leaves of Selva with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised leaves. Increased numbers of conidia germinated successfully on leaves of Aromas with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised Aromas leaves, however, the germinated conidia still failed to develop into sporulating colonies. Potassium nutrition had no obvious effect on P. aphanis development. Foliar concentration found to be adequate for growth of cultivars, Selva and Aromas were 6.0 mg/g and 4.5 mg/g Calcium, dry weight and 11.0 mg/g and 12.5 mg/g potassium, dry weight (respectively). Potassium silicate, buffered to pH 7.0 and applied as a foliar fertiliser, reduced the severity of powdery mildew below the economic threshold, though not below the disease severity on plants treated with the fungicide, Systhane&#174; (Bayer CropScience). As potassium silicate can be produced organically this compound may provide a useful management tool for both organic and conventional strawberry growers. Although the cultivar Aromas was not immune to disease under conducive conditions and high inoculum load in the field, inoculation of healthy Aromas plants with P. aphanis in the laboratory failed to produce disease. Conidia were seldom found attached to the leaf surface of healthy Aromas leaves. Germination and subsequent colony development were also not observed in inoculated samples. This suggests there is some mechanism of Aromas that inhibits development of this fungus. Preliminary investigation of differential expression in Aromas inoculated with P. aphanis, identified sequences with homology to a putative antimicrobial protein and photosynthesis-related genes. The results of these studies should enable growers to increase both crop yields and control of powdery mildew, one of the major economic diseases in South Australia. The epidemiological knowledge attained will be valuable, and may provide the basis for future forecast modelling for P. aphanis in strawberry crops in South Australia. Recommendations for calcium and potassium leaf content will allow growers to monitor their fertiliser regime for increased yield of these cultivars. Aromas was identified as a powdery mildew resistant cultivar potentially suitable for production in South Australia, and the genes associated with this resistance response may be used in studies of Fragaria species and breeding for powdery mildew resistant cultivars.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strawberry; powdery mildew; epidemidogy; nutrition; calcium; potassium; silicon; Fragaria; Podosphaera aphanis</field><field name="subject">Strawberries Growth.</field><field name="subject">Strawberries Nutrition.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the periconceptional environment (in vivo and ex vivo) on feto-placental development in the sheep.</field><field name="creator">MacLaughlin, Severence Michael</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

Yet there is little research on how public mental health services (PMHS) does, or could, address the needs of MSM. When such literature does appear, a common suggestion is that queer staff will be necessary to improve PMHS for MSM through a process of &#8216;matching&#8217;. Yet, no research has specifically explored the views of queer staff or MSM clients on this. Further, a positivist trend within the existing literature contains individualising and essentialising assumptions that limit our understanding of relationships between MSM and PMHS. Adopting a critical social constructionist perspective, I argue that Foucauldian theory and its analysis of the relationships between discourses, power, and subjectivity, enables research to focus on the social and structural processes constructing mental health care for MSM. This thesis explores the discursive construction of the relationships between MSM and PMHS, and the implications of this for practice. My analysis begins by explicating commonly circulating discourses of homosexuality, and of mental health, in New Zealand. These discourses are evidenced in (but not limited to) academic literature, governmental documents, and queer and mainstream media. They provide a framework for the analysis of interviews with 12 queer staff and 13 MSM clients of PMHS. The analyses illustrate the multiple discourses informing the MSM&#8217;s subjectivities as homosexuals and show the predominant discourses they draw on to account for their mental health problems. I suggest the term &#8216;homonegative trauma&#8217; to denote this. Analyses of the staff and clients&#8217; accounts around the &#8216;disclosure&#8217; of homosexuality within PMHS reveal discursive power relations which restrain staff, and some clients, from acknowledging homosexuality. I consider two strategies for disrupting this heteronormative silence within PMHS. I contend that the notion of &#8216;matching&#8217; queer clients and staff is a minoritising one, with limited ability to counter heteronormativity. In contrast, a universalising approach requires all staff to initiate conversations with all clients about sexuality. Making a comparison between staff inquiring about sexuality, and the currently recommended practice of staff asking about sexual abuse, I argue that this analogy provides useful resources to support such a universalising move. I conclude by arguing for systemic and structural changes in PMHS to support staff to routinely enquire about sexuality. If done with an awareness of the discursive complexity involved, such a shift has the potential to disrupt heteronormative practices within PMHS. My analysis suggests that the power of the medical discourse in particular, will be a significant restraint to such a change. However, if heteronormative practices within PMHS remain unchallenged they will continue to silence some MSM clients, thereby, maintaining the homonegative trauma described by most of the MSM clients interviewed. This would reproduce a tendency within the medical discourse to focus on individual pathology and to evade the ways in which social marginalisation and oppression can be constructive of mental health problems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic sampling in ecology</field><field name="creator">Pawley, Matthew David McDonald</field><field name="description">Random start systematic sampling (SYS) is a survey design that is simple (it selects the whole sample with one random start), easy to implement and that can, in theory, give precise estimates of ecological abundance in the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation. However, SYS suffers from a serious defect, namely, that it is not possible to obtain an unbiased estimator of sampling variance (&#952;SYS) on the basis of a single sample. A variety of approximations have been suggested, and unbiased modelbased methods have been calculated, but validation of these estimators has been limited within the ecological literature. The heart of any spatial problem is how to deal with spatial autocorrelation. We show that the scale of spatial inference gives a framework that unifies the commonly reported, discordant views about autocorrelation (i.e. &#8216;autocorrelation increases the power of the analysis&#8217; vs &#8216;autocorrelation decreases the power of the analysis&#8217;). The scale of spatial inference is rarely discussed or considered, but we suggest that it should be the first step in any (spatial) analysis. The thesis then uses computer simulation to compare the performance of eleven previously proposed SYS estimators (including simple random sampling, 4SRS). The computer simulations are designed to recreate the spatial distribution characteristics that are common within ecological abundances. We also develop and test a novel method of estimating &#952;SYS based on &#8216;Krige&#8217;s Additivity Relationship&#8217; and variography (geostatistics). This estimator was labelled 4KAR. We found that if the right spatial model (i.e. a reference theoretical variogram) is used, then 4KAR appears to be an unbiased estimator of &#952;. Without a priori knowledge about the spatial structure (so the theoretical variogram is constructed solely from SYS data), 4KAR was generally one of the least biased and most stable estimators out of those examined. The other estimator that fared well, 4r1, was also model-based; it used an estimate of the first order autocorrelation in its estimate of &#952;. 4SRS performed comparatively well on untransformed ecological simulations, but was the worst performing estimator after a log(x+1) transformation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Military Culture, War Crimes and the Defence of Superior Orders</field><field name="creator">Mohammed, Aziz</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to examine the military culture of obedience and the standards that exist relating to the defence of superior orders.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ReFashion reDunn : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Janet</field><field name="description">This study arises out of the researcher&#8217;s experience in the fields of costume and fashion. It develops, through design practice and reflection, a design process for fashion wear made from post-consumer recycled materials. Theoretical analysis provides global, historical, philosophical and design contexts within which to develop an ethos for this variant form of fashion wear designated ReFashion. Differences in design process between conventional fashion and ReFashion are detailed to highlight the significance of provenance of materials in the light of a perceived need to slow down clothing production and consumption. This perception is informed by scientific predictions that failure to engage with urgently needed changes to the prevalent economic paradigm will result in planet earth reaching a tipping point with potentially disastrous results for its inhabitants. Fundamental to the ReFashion ethos is preparedness for a speculative post-apocalyptic future that might render the fashion system unable to operate as it currently does, necessitating a more self-sufficient approach to clothing needs, with an accompanying shift in perceptions of what is deemed fashionable. The theme Survivalist Fantasy provides a lens to bring conceptual and material aspects of the work into focus. Informed by sustainability, Survivalist Fantasy recontextualises a failure of sustainable initiatives on a global scale and their adaptation on a local scale specifically in the arena of clothing.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fashion</field><field name="subject">costume</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">recycled materials</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In memory of cats : the camera and the ordinary moment : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Korver, Ruth M.</field><field name="description">In memory of cats: The camera and the ordinary moment looks at the way in which families use photographs to remember the past.

Martha Langford&#8217;s study of the similarities between structures in oral culture and the photograph album and Annette Kuhn&#8217;s strategies for reading family photographs in a broader historical context, are used to examine and recover memories from my own photographic archive. Using moving image to record those memories and then tell how that photographic evidence has shaped my present, is a process suggested by Linda Williams in her writing about how postmodern documentary can use the past to intervene in the present. Other documentary styles, performative documentary and the essay film, offer a structure for personal memories to be revisited and re-presented to public viewers. Offering a space for personal or specific memories to be understood or related to by a viewer is discussed by Lisa Saltzman, who looks at indexical forms other than the photograph, like casting and tracing. These ideas culminated in my video work, A Clowder of Cats, which explores the losses that have been a part of my history, through photographs of the cats my family has owned. The camera gives us a strategy to remember moments that may otherwise have been forgotten, and moving image provides a space for those ordinary moments to be bought back to the present.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal memories</field><field name="subject">photographs of cats</field><field name="subject">video images</field><field name="subject">friends and family</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410203 Photography studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/956</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement of 'community readiness' for the prevention of adolescent substance abuse: a pilot study in four Australian regional communities</field><field name="creator">Jones, Stephanie Louise</field><field name="description">Health promotion and public health research increasingly recognise that a range of community organisation and attitudinal factors are important to a community&#8217;s level of readiness, or capacity, to undertake effective prevention activity required to reduce population rates of adolescent substance abuse.

Although this concept is not novel, the molecular mechanism behind it remains unclear. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), regulates anxiety and is a part of the stress response. The NPY system also modulates immune functions such as cytokine release, cell migration, and innate immune cell activity. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves innervating lymphoid organs release NPY, which together with other peptides activate five receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6). Additionally, immune cells themselves release NPY following activation. Previous studies have shown that Y1 mediates NPY-immune effects and data presented here shows expression of Y1 on a wide range of immune cells. Results presented in this thesis, using Y1-deficient mice (Y1-/-), have uncovered a novel role for Y1 on immune cells. NPY acts endogenously to inhibit T cell activation whereas Y1-/- T cells are hyper-responsive to activation and trigger severe colitis after transfer into lymphopenic mice. Thus, signalling through the Y1 receptor on T cells inhibits T cell activation and controls the magnitude of T cell responses. Paradoxically, in Y1-/- mice, T cell differentiation to Th1 T cells appears to be defective as these mice were resistant to T helper type 1 (Th1) cell???mediated inflammatory responses and showed reduced levels of the Th1 cell???promoting cytokine interleukin 12 and reduced interferon ?? production. This defect was due to functionally impaired antigen presenting cells (APCs). Y1-deficient APCs are defective in their ability to produce Th1-promoting cytokines and present antigens to T cells and consequently, Y1-/- mice had reduced numbers of effector T cells. Key reciprocal bone marrow chimera experiments indicated that this effect is intrinsic to immune cells and not driven by other Y1-expressing cell types. These results demonstrate a fundamental bimodal role for the Y1 receptor in the immune system, serving as a strong negative regulator on T cells as well as a key activator of APC function. The findings presented in this thesis uncover a sophisticated molecular mechanism regulating immune cell functions and thus adds to a growing number of signalling pathways shared by the immune and nervous system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuropeptides</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of c-Jun in angiogenesis and cancer: insights using gene targeting approaches</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guishui, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most common causes of death worldwide. Angiogenesis plays a critical role tumourigenesis and atherogenesis. As a member of the basic region-leucine zipper protein family, c-Jun, has been linked with cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. However, the relationship between c-Jun and angiogenesis has not been firmly established.  In this thesis, strategies targeting c-Jun mRNA such as DNAzyme and siRNA have been designed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the c-Jun mRNA and c-Jun protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These agents block c-Jun expression and inhibit DNA binding activity of c-Jun. Luciferase assay showed that c-Jun siRNA suppressed c-Jun/AP-1-dependent reporter activity. The processes of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation were all down-regulated after treatment with c-Jun targeting agents. In vivo, c-Jun DNAzymes and siRNA inhibit angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis, including tumour angiogenesis and growth, matrix angiogenesis, corneal angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization. This is mediated, at least in part, by c-Jun siRNA or DNAzyme inhibition of MMP-2 expression.  These findings demonstrate the critical role played by c-Jun in the involvement of neovascularization and suggest that DNAzymes or siRNAs are efficient gene-silencing agents. The ability to identify and control key genes in angiogenesis provides opportunities for developing therapeutic molecular tools to treat cancer or other angiogenesis related diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Angiography</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of activation and implementation of the medical emergency team system</field><field name="creator">Cretikos, Michelle, School of Anaesthetics, Intensive Care &amp; Emergency Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem investigated: The activation and implementation of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) system. Procedures followed: The ability of the objective activation criteria to accurately identify patients at risk of three serious adverse events (cardiac arrest, unexpected death and unplanned intensive care admission) was assessed using a nested, matched case-control study. Sensitivity, specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were performed. The MET implementation process was studied using two convenience sample surveys of the nursing staff from the general wards of twelve intervention hospitals. These surveys measured the awareness and understanding of the MET system, level of attendance at MET education sessions, knowledge of the activation criteria, level of intention to call the MET and overall attitude to the MET system, and the hospital level of support for change, hospital capability and hospital culture. The association of these measures with the intention to call the MET and the level of MET utilisation was assessed using nonparametric  correlation.  Results obtained: The respiratory rate was missing in 20% of subjects. Using listwise deletion, the set of objective activation criteria investigated predicted an adverse event within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 55.4% (50.6-60.0%) and specificity of 93.7% (91.2-95.6%). An analysis approach that assumed the missing values would not have resulted in MET activation provided a sensitivity of 50.4% (45.7- 55.2%) and specificity of 93.3% (90.8-95.3%). Alternative models with modified cut-off values provided different results. The MET system was implemented with variable success during the MERIT study. Knowledge and understanding of the system, hospital readiness, and a positive attitude were all significantly positively associated with MET system utilisation, while defensive hospital cultures were negatively associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Major conclusions: The objective activation criteria studied have acceptable accuracy, but modification of the criteria may be considered. A satisfactory trade-off between the identification of patients at risk and workload requirements may be difficult to achieve. Measures of effectiveness of the implementation process may be associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Trials of the MET system should ensure good knowledge and understanding of the system, particularly amongst nursing staff.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capital structure and dividend policy in a personal tax free environment: the case of Oman</field><field name="creator">Al Yahyaee, Khamis, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines four specific aspects of capital structure and dividend policy. The first issue concerns the determinants of capital structure dynamics. The primary objective is to examine whether stock returns are important factors in firm???s capital structure choice, and if so, whether this effect is persistent. In so doing, we use a data set which (1) avoids the complexity of tax rates faced by previous studies, (2) we introduce new variables that are unique to Oman, and (3) we distinguish empirically between bank debt and non-bank debt. We find stock returns are a first order determinant of capital structure. Firms do show some tendency to rebalance towards their target capital structure. However, the impact of stock returns dominates the effects of rebalancing. We also find new evidence that firms do take countermeasures to offset changes in their leverage that stem from equity value variations, but do so at a low speed. The next topic studied concerns the ex-dividend day behaviour. We investigate this issue using a unique data set where there are no taxes on dividends and capital gains and stock prices are decimalized. In this economy, any price decline that is smaller than the dividends can not be attributed to taxes and price discreteness. We find that the stock price drops by less than the amount of dividends and there is a significant positive ex-day return. We are able to account for our results using market microstructure models. The third issue investigated is the stock price reaction to dividend announcements. Tax-based signaling models argue that dividends would not have  information and be informative if it is not for the higher taxes on dividends relative to capital gains that they apply to shareholders. The absence of personal taxes in Oman presents a valuable opportunity to test this prediction. Our results show that the announcements of dividend increases (decreases) are associated with a stock price increase (decrease) which contradicts the tax-based signaling models. The final chapter analyzes the determinants and stability of dividend policy of financial and non-financial firms. Investigating this issue is important for at least two reasons. First, Omani firms distribute almost 100% of their profits in dividends which led the Capital Market Authority (CMA) to issue a circular (number 12/2003) arguing that firms should retain some of their earnings for ???rainy days???. This allows us understand the characteristics of firms that pay dividends. Second, firms are highly levered mainly through bank loans which render the role of dividends in reducing the agency costs less important. Unlike most previous studies, we include both dividend paying and non-dividend paying firms to avoid a selection bias. We find that there are some common factors that determine dividend policy of both financial and non-financial firms and there are some factors that affect only non-financial firms. We also find that the factors that influence the probability to pay dividends are the same factors that drive the amount of dividends paid for both financial and non-financial firms. We document that non-financial firms adopt a policy of smoothing dividends while financial firms do not have a stable dividend policy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations -- Oman -- Finance</field><field name="subject">Dividends</field><field name="subject">Stocks -- Prices</field><field name="subject">Bank capital -- Oman</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fragile X mental retardation and fragile X chromosomes in the Indonesian population</field><field name="creator">Hussein, Sultana Muhammad, School of Pathology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Indonesian archipelago comprises more than 17,000 islands, inhabited by ~200 million people constituting more than 350 recognizable ethnic and tribal groups which can be classified into two broad ethno-linguistic groups [the Austronesian (AN) and non-Austronesian (NAN) speaking peoples] and 3 physical anthropology groups (Deutero Malay, Proto Malay and Papuan).  The origins of these groups are of considerable anthropological interest. The anthropology of Indonesia is extremely complex and still controversial. The present populations of Indonesia show very great diversity. The data presented below result from an investigation of the Fragile X A syndrome and the size and distribution of alleles at fragile sites on the X chromosome among Javanese males with developmental disability (DD) and unselected males from 10 major Indonesian ethnic groups.	The Fragile X syndrome is caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat array in the 5' untranslated region of the FMR-1 gene at Xq27.3. Normal X chromosomes have between 6-54 CGG trinucleotide repeats, whereas premutation alleles have 55-230 and full mutation alleles more than 230 repeats.  In a study of predominantly Caucasian males with intellectual disability, the prevalence of Fragile X syndrome is estimated to be approximately 1:4,000.  FRAXE mental retardation syndrome is caused by an expansion of a GCC trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of FMR2 gene located 600 kb telomeric to FMR1. The prevalence of FMR2 is 1-2 per 100,000 live births. FMR2 common alleles consist of 11-30 GGC repeats; intermediate alleles between 31-60 GCC repeats; premutation alleles with 61-200 repeats and full mutation alleles have over 200 repeats with attendant methylation of the repeat array	The first Indonesian screening program aimed at determining the presence and prevalence of fragile XA syndrome among individuals with mild DD (IQ above 50) from special schools (N=205) and isolated areas (N=50) of Java was undertaken in 1994-1996 by cytogenetic and molecular studies. In this first study 4 fragile X positive children were found among 255 males with DD. The estimated prevalence of fragile-X in males with mild DD from special schools was 1.95% (5/205) and the overall prevalence was 1.57% (4/255).	The number of trinucleotide repeats in the 5' untranslated regions of the FMR1 and FMR2 genes were determined by PCR in 254 Fragile XA-negative Javanese male children with DD. The distribution of FMR1 and FMR2 trinucleotide repeat alleles was found to be significantly different in the Indonesian population with DD compared to that in equivalent Caucasian populations. The trimodal distribution of Indonesian FMR1 alleles (29, 30 and 36 repeats) is largely in agreement with findings from other Asian populations).  This provides supportive evidence that the origin of Indonesians could be the same as that of the Chinese and Japanese. 	Sequence analysis was performed on the trinucleotide repeat arrays of the 27 individuals' FMR1 alleles in the 'grey zone' (35-52 repeats). The identification of 16 unrelated individuals with a (CGG)36 allele that also contains a (CGG)6 segment [(CGG)9AGG(CGG)9AGG(CGG)6 AGG(CGG)9 or 9A9A6A9 pattern] is in agreement with earlier observations in the Japanese population.  It is proposed that this FMR1 array pattern may be specific for Asian populations and that Javanese and Japanese populations may have arisen from a single progenitor population. The presence of pure 25, 33 and 34 CGGs in FMR1 alleles with 36, 44 and 45 repeats respectively, suggests that these may represent alleles at high risk for instability and may therefore be at early stages of expansion to a premutation. The lack of the characteristic (CGG)6 in all three alleles with ?? 25 pure CGG arrays suggests that the most common Asian 36 repeat allele is not predisposed to slippage expansion. Seven of the 8 alleles with 36 CGG repeats could be sequenced.  Seven of 36 CGG repeats FMR1 alleles from the Hiri population has been sequenced and 4 alleles indicated 9A9A6A9 pattern, 1 sample with 10A25 pattern  Two of the remaining alleles showed 12A6A6A9 structure, which consisted of a tandem duplication of the (CGG)6 segment.  The presence of a tandem duplication of (CGG)6 segments has never been reported in any other population.	The other major findings of this study are that FRAXE syndrome is a rare cause of developmental disability in this predominantly-Javanese population.  The most common FMR2 (GCC)20 allele in this selected Asian population is significantly longer than that previously reported for Caucasian populations.  There was a weak correlation between the overall length of the FMR1 and FMR2 repeat arrays within the normal range (Spearman's Rank Correlation = 0.130, p-value=0.042) in the Indonesian population, which have been no previous associations reported for alleles within the normal range. 	One approach to studying the origins of the human populations is to study the genetic structure of polymorphic alleles such as those at the FMR1 locus and its linked microsatellite markers DXS548 and FRAXAC1.  Length polymorphisms of the FMR1 gene (CGG)n repeat array, DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were studied in a total of 1,008 unselected males from 10 different Indonesian ethnic groups.  FMR1 alleles were identified ranging from 8 to 57 CGG repeats. The most common CGG repeat allele was 29 (45.6%) followed by 30 (27.4%) and 36 repeats (8.0%). One hundred and forty four grey zone (3-52 CGG) alleles were found in the study population.  Four people of the same ethnic group from an isolated island in Eastern Indonesia (Hiri, Ternate), a representative of the NAN ethnolinguistic group, had CGG repeat lengths of 55-57.  The prevalence of these alleles is estimated to be 3.3% (4/120) in the population of Hiri or 0.4% (4/1008) of whole Indonesian population.	Thirteen different alleles were found at the DXS548 locus, of which allele numbers 7 [194 bp] (44.1%), 6.5 [195bp] (43.5%) and 6 [196bp] (7.5%) are the most common.  Seven rare alleles, some of which have not been previously found in Asian peoples were also identified (190, 191,192, 193, 197,198, 199, 202, 204 and 206) and accounted for 3.9% of the total.  The odd number alleles were dominantly found in this study whereas almost none found in Caucasian. The finding of many "odd numbered" alleles DXS548 has never been found in other Asian population and has only been documented extremely rarely in Caucasians and Africans.	Five different alleles of FRAXAC1 identified with alleles D [106 bp] (62.2%) and C [108bp] (35.6%) accounting for 97.8% of FRAXAC1 alleles in the population.  Three rare alleles (104, 110, 112 bp = 2.2%) were identified that have not been previously found in other Asian populations (1-3).  There is a striking linkage disequilibrium of FMR1 alleles with FRAXAC1 (p=0.0001), 88% of 29 (CGG)n repeats alleles associated with FRAXAC1 allele D (106bp) versus only 17% with the 30 (CGG)n repeat alleles, which is in agreement with other studies.  The value of D' was calculated to be 0.7.	The longer alleles of both DXS548 and FRAXAC1 were found mostly in the NAN ethnolinguistic group. Moreover the Irian Jaya people also showed a higher percentage of people with 30 CGG repeats and the 108 bp FRAXAC1.  The Eastern Indonesian NAN groups demonstrate a different genetic background probably due to the contribution of Melanesian peoples.	The Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) identified that the vast majority of genetic diversity occurs within, rather than between, ethnic groups.  These data are consistent with a model where there is sufficient migration (~20 per generation) between populations to minimise differentiation of population through genetic drift. The results obtained are consistent with three clusters of populations that share similar allele frequencies at the fragile X locus.  The most clearly defined cluster is based in the east of Indonesia and includes the two Irian populations, Minahasans and Hiri. A surprising finding was that the Minahasan who are Deutero-Malay in origin and physical appearance are genetically closer to the Irianese.  This may reflect the admixture of Melanesian alleles or other eastern Indonesian alleles as a result of their geographic location in that part of Indonesia.	The second major cluster is largely based in the west of the country and is composed of the following Deutero-Malay populations; Javanese, Balinese, Acehnese but which also includes people from Ternate (not including those from Hiri).  Using Delta Mu and Nei's genetic distance for FMR1 locus in this study the Javanese were shown to have the closest distance to Balinese which is consistent with anthropological data and with published data.	The third group is a "western and central" group composed of Bimanese, Dayak and Sundanese who share some features of the western and eastern clusters but mostly resemble the western Indonesian populations. Bima is located in the lesser Sunda in between west Indonesia and east Indonesia. The Bimanese are of mixed Deutero &amp; Proto Malay origin that is consistent with their geographic location.	The Bataks are distinctive and sit somewhat apart in this scheme. In this study, Bataks were found not to resemble the other Proto-Malay group studied (the Dayak).  The Dayaks were found to have fewer alleles than the Bataks at FRAXAC1 and DXS548.  In all four methods of calculating genetic distance Bataks showed a large genetic distance to almost all other ethnic groups.	There are differences in allele frequency between east and west Indonesia as well as other Asian nations, but the genetic similarities between these groups are also very impressive.  The findings from this study are consistent with other genetic anthropological evidence that the people of Indonesia have the same origin as North-east Asian groups.  This model is referred to as the "express train from Taiwan" in which the Austronesian speakers are proposed to have radiated from Taiwan bringing the Malayo-Polynesian language group to the Philippines, Borneo and Sulawesi around 5000-4500 B.P.E. However Richards et al.(1998) have used the diversity in the mtDNA D Loop to propose an alternative to the "express train" model.  The "two train7quot; model proposes that the Austronesian languages originated within eastern Indonesia during the Pleistocene era and spread through Melanesia and into the remote Pacific within the past 6,000 years.  Unfortunately the high migration rates between population groups that were demonstrated in this thesis and the known migration patterns of populations through Indonesia preclude determining whether the observed allelic heterogeneity is a function of the original population or due to the admixture of several gene pools in more recent times.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">X linked mental retardation</field><field name="subject">Fragile X syndrome</field><field name="subject">Mental retardation Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metallisation and interconnection of polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Timothy M, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film photovoltaics seem set to become a large part of future photovoltaic production worldwide, due to the fact that thin-film photovoltaic modules have the potential to be manufactured for a significantly lower cost per peak Watt of photovoltaic electricity produced than traditional wafer-based photovoltaic modules. Of particular interest are polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film photovoltaic devices on foreign supporting superstrates such as glass, because they combine the best features of wafer-based modules (long-term stability, vast manufacturing experience) with the best features of thin-film modules (lower materials cost, and monolithic construction techniques). Since polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates are a relatively recent development in photovoltaics, there remains much scope for the investigation and implementation of novel metallisation and interconnection schemes. This thesis is concerned with the invention and development of metallisation and interconnection schemes for this new photovoltaic material, poly-Si on glass. In this thesis, several new metallisation and interconnection schemes for poly-Si solar cells on glass superstrates were invented and investigated: - The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme, which is based on cells with interdigitated n-type and p-type contacts, and subsequent inter-connection of individual cells. - The metal-free interconnection scheme, which relies on laser-doping of regions of the silicon film to interconnect adjacent cells, and does not require metal contacts. - The spanning-gap interconnection scheme, which involves laser-scribing of the silicon film, and overdoping one sidewall of each laser scribe, then connecting adjacent cells by filling the laser scribe with metal. - The wrap-over interconnection scheme, which employs laser scribing and insulating and conductive laser-scribe sidewalls, and a metal layer which interconnects adjacent cells. Also investigated was the specific contact resistance of each type of metal-semiconductor contact used in the various interconnection schemes. The various interconnection schemes were developed to different levels of completion. The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme yielded fully functioning mini-modules with good efficiencies. The wrap-over interconnection scheme made it to the proof of concept stage, while the other two schemes did not reach completion due to various technical difficulties and time constraints.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The shear strength of rock masses</field><field name="creator">Douglas, Kurt John, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The first section of this thesis (Chapter 2) describes the creation and analysis of a database on concrete and masonry dam incidents known as CONGDATA.

This analysis was used to develop a method of very approximately assessing probabilities of failure. This can be used in initial risk assessments of large concrete and masonry dams along with analysis of stability for various annual exceedance probability floods. The second and main section of this thesis (Chapters 3-6) had its origins in the results of Chapter 2 and the general interests of the author. It was found that failure through the foundation was common in the list of dams analysed and that information on how to assess the strength of the foundations of dams on rock masses was limited. This section applies to all applications of rock mass strength such as the stability of rock slopes. Methods used for assessing the shear strength of jointed rock masses are based on empirical criteria. As a general rule such criteria are based on laboratory scale specimens with very little, and often no, field validation. The Hoek-Brown empirical rock mass failure criterion was developed in 1980 for hard rock masses. Since its development it has become virtually universally accepted and is now used for all types of rock masses and in all stress regimes. This thesis uses case studies and databases of intact rock and rockfill triaxial tests collated by the author to review the current Hoek-Brown criterion. The results highlight the inability of the criterion to fit all types of intact rock and poor quality rock masses. This arose predominately due to the exponent a being restrained to approximately 0.5 to 0.62 and using rock type as a predictor of mi. Modifications to the equations for determining the Hoek-Brown parameters are provided that overcome these problems. In the course of reviewing the Hoek-Brown criterion new equations were derived for estimating the shear strength of intact rock and rockfill. Empirical slope design curves have also been developed for use as a preliminary tool for slope design.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Rock mechanics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating restorative justice: a study of conference convenors</field><field name="creator">Bruce, Jasmine, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Restorative justice is a process that is increasingly becoming valued as a method for conflict resolution within the criminal justice system toward the resolution of crime. Despite a growing enthusiasm for the aims of restorative justice, there has been some concern as to whether this process actually works in practice. This reinforces the need for careful management of restorative practices, as it is essential for safeguarding the integrity of the process. Trained facilitators usually run restorative processes such as conferencing, however, the topic of conference management has remained surprisingly underdeveloped in the research literature. The aim of this study is to examine in detail approaches to facilitation, as this is a key element of conference practice.  Conference facilitation is examined in this study as an occupation, and the process of occupational socialisation is regarded as central to an understanding of facilitation practice more broadly. The research is based on Youth Justice Conferencing in New South Wales. The thesis makes use of qualitative data collected from observing 45 conferences and interviewing 60 convenors and managers. The theoretical element of this study draws on ideas from the literature on occupations and organisations.  The key findings from the research show the complexity of conference practice and the strategies facilitators use to cope with the unpredictability of conferencing. Even though facilitators' primary occupational experience helped them adjust to their conferencing work it also clouded their facilitation practice in less than ideal ways. A major finding was that while facilitators all received the same training they adopted a variety of facilitation styles. A central argument of this thesis is that facilitation is a skilful accomplishment that is deeply embedded in the procedures and rituals of restorative justice that it is largely taken for granted and remains unrecognised.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An experimental study on high speed milling and a predictive force model</field><field name="creator">Ekanayake, Risheeka Ayomi, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the research work carried out in an experimental study on High Speed Milling and a predictive force model. The Oxley??s machining theory [36] that can be considered a purely theoretical approach, which has not yet been applied to the high speed milling process is used to model this process in order to predict the cutting forces. An experimental programme was carried out in order to study and understand the high speed milling process and to collect force data for machining of AISI 1020 plain carbon steel at speeds from 250 to 500m/min, feed rates 0.025 to 0.075mm/tooth and 0.5 and 0.8mm depths of cut, using three different tool configurations with different nose radii. The model developed by Young [5] using the Oxley??s machining theory, for conventional milling, was first applied to the high speed milling operation. The force predictions were satisfactory compared to the measured forces. Using this as the basis, a theoretical model was developed to predict the cutting forces in high speed milling. A smaller chip element was considered in applying the machining theory to satisfy the assumption of two dimensional deformation in the machining theory. Using the flow stress properties for plain carbon steels obtained by Oxley and his co-workers, the cutting force components: tangential, radial and vertical, were predicted with the new developed model for AISI 1020 steel for the same cutting conditions used in the experiment. The model was able to accurately predict the tangential force, while the other two components showed a good agreement with the experimental forces. Then the model was verified using two other materials namely, AISI 1045 plain carbon steel and AISI 4140 alloy steel. The alloy steel was used in both the states, virgin and hardened (heat treated) for the experiment. The comparison of predictions with experimental forces showed good results for these additional two materials. From the results obtained, it is concluded that the developed model can be used to predict the tangential cutting force accurately, while predicting the other force components with a favourable accuracy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predictions</field><field name="subject">High speed milling</field><field name="subject">Forces</field><field name="subject">Machining theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon cycling in sub-alpine ecosystems</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Meaghan Edith, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The relationship between temperature and soil respiration has been well explored although uncertainties remain. This thesis examined the relationship between temperature and rates of heterotrophic respiration in soils from three adjacent sub-alpine Australian vegetation types; woodland, shrubland and grassland. Temperature sensitivity of soil (Q10) has recently been a hotly debate topic, one side concluding that decomposition of recalcitrant, less labile components of soil organic matter are insensitive to temperature. Whilst others argue that there is no difference in the temperature sensitivities of labile and recalcitrant carbon pools. Robust modeling of rates of soil respiration requires characterization of the temperature response of both labile and recalcitrant pools. Laboratory incubation provides a means of characterizing the temperature response of rates of respiration whilst reducing the confounding effects encountered in the field, such as seasonal fluctuations in temperature, moisture and substrate supply. I used a novel system that allowed laboratory measurement of gas exchange in soils over a range of temperatures under controlled conditions. Measurements included CO2 efflux and O2 uptake over a range of temperatures from 5 to 40oC, characterization of temperature response and sensitivity, and respiratory quotients. Rates of heterotrophic respiration fitted both exponential and Arrhenius functions and temperature sensitivity varied and depended on the model used, vegetation type and depth in the soil profile. Long-term incubation indicated both labile and resistant pools of carbon had similar temperature sensitivities. Respiratory quotients provided a strongly predictive measure of the potential rate of decomposition of soil C, independent of the temperature response of respiration, providing a tool that may be used alongside derived parameters to help understand shifts in microbial use of C substrates. Vegetation type influenced soil chemical properties and rates of heterotrophic respiration. Rates of respiration correlated well with concentrations of carbon and nitrogen as has been previously observed, unlike previous studies however a positive correlation was observed between indices of plant available phosphorus and respiration. The soils examined were from three adjacent vegetation types formed on common geology, I concluded that vegetation type had a significant influence on soil, in contrast to the commonly held view by ecologists that soil type drives patterns in vegetation. Climatic effects such as longer, dryer hotter summer, reduced snow cover and increased incidence of extreme weather events such as frosts and bushfire are likely to drive patterns in vegetation in this region and therefore have a significant impact on carbon cycling in Sub-alpine Australian soils.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Respiratory quotients</field><field name="subject">Soil Respiration</field><field name="subject">Temperature Sensitivity</field><field name="subject">Microbial Respiration</field><field name="subject">Subalpine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, construction and control of an industrial scale biped robot</field><field name="creator">Cronin, Joe, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A 500Kg, self-contained biped robot, named Roboshift, has been conceived and tested to investigate issues associated with the control of industrial scale biped robots. This project represents the first credible attempt to build a heavy weight autonomous biped robot. The recent expansion in humanoid robot development has highlighted advances made in anthropomorphic biped technology. Current research into speech recognition, vision systems, laser topography, artificial intelligence and electroactive polymers will ultimately achieve an Android capable of human like actions and thought processes. Justification for this most demanding and expensive research is based on philanthropic models that suggest these robots will attend to the bedridden, or replace humans in dangerous areas. However, the cost of a biped robot when compared to that of a wheeled or tracked vehicle restricts commercialisation for these applications. As well, the size and working capacity of current humanoid robots is not compatible with the heavy lifting requirements found in such environments. It is proposed that only biped robots of an industrial scale, possessing a capacity much greater than that of a human, will be of commercial value in the future. Typical applications may include the handling of materials in confined or uneven terrain, where a forklift or other commercially available materials handling equipment would be unsuitable. For example, field handling in military, mining or geological environments. Minimal research has been conducted into the realisation of such a device, which presents challenges in terms of the magnitude of dynamic forces produced and of the systems required to control the robot in real-time. Review of relevant literature reveals that little research has been completed in this field. Therefore, operational characteristics for an industrial scale biped robot are defined. The design then details the structure and integration of mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems. Roboshift is powered by an internal combustion engine and is the first biped robot with a capacity for extended operation. Modelling was conducted to determine joint trajectories, power requirements, hydraulic flow parameters and dynamic characteristics. The robot is controlled by a distributed, hierarchical system comprising sixteen microprocessors, a control computer acting as the midbrain and a communications computer acting as the central nervous system. Sensors measure attitude and heading (vestibular system) as well as ground reaction forces and joint angles (propreoception). The control strategy is based on feed forward trajectories generated by inverse kinematic analysis. Corrections to trajectories are made in real time by higher level routines running on the main control computer. Joint position is achieved by local feedback control. Software for the robot was written in the C language. Experimental results are presented detailing the performance of the robot in comparison to theoretical analysis. After construction and testing of actuators and sensors, calibration software was tested successfully. Once calibrated, the robot was lowered to the ground where the active balance software was able to control the robot in the frontal and sagittal planes. Frontal sway software was tested with mixed success as natural oscillation of the structure, which was not detectable by the control system, led to erroneous force data. Detailed dynamic modelling was then completed to determine the causes of oscillation in the robot. The modelling led to the formulation of a control strategy where non-collocated sensors are used to measure link strain as a feedback to a modified proportional controller. The project has demonstrated that an industrial scale biped incorporating an internal combustion engine and hydraulic power system is feasible.. Analysis presented proposes that as the height of a biped robot increases, the expected elastic deformation of the structure increases as the cube of the height, making control extremely challenging. A strategy for the control of heavy-weight robots is suggested It is also proposed that technology incorporated in current humanoid robots can not be scaled to control industrial bipeds.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing Policy Leadership: A Strategic Approach to Strengthening Policy Capacity in the Health Bureaucracy</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Deborah</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been increasing interest in improving the quality of policy through building the policy capacity of public sector institutions. To date, however, there has been little evidence on which to base capacity building interventions.
This thesis presents a study of policy process and policy capacity in the Department of Human Services (DHS) in the Australian State of Victoria. Policy capacity was defined as the organisational infrastructure that supports effective policy development and implementation (including individual competencies).
The study drew on the health policy, public policy and public administration literature. Data collection methods involved (i) individual in-depth interviews with policy workers in four policy-oriented organisational units of DHS to explore the policy process and policy capacity, and (ii) a focus group and individual interviews with experienced policy workers to explore potential capacity building strategies.
Findings indicate that building policy capacity requires attention to four domains: building and managing a policy-competent workforce; developing formal processes and guidelines for strengthening the policy process; strengthening organisational culture and policy leadership; and strengthening structures and relationships to support policy capacity. Building capacity also involves negotiating tensions between policy capacity and two other elements of governing capacity (administrative capacity and state capacity).
The appropriate choice of capacity building strategies depends on context and contingency, including the specifics of particular policies, times and settings. Accordingly, the thesis concludes that a focus on developing policy leadership at the middle and senior levels would be a strategic approach to building policy capacity. Policy leadership involves local level judgement, mentorship, initiative and responsibility, and the ability to mobilise organisational resources to build policy capacity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health policy</field><field name="subject">government policy</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20100513.120047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Keep Sunday free: social engineering through shop trading hours in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Ann-Marie</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to explore Social Engineering and how marketing communications may be able to affect it. This research takes a step back from other research in the area and considers the decision makers behind Social Engineering, instead of Social Engineering interventions. One way for stakeholders to influence Social Engineering is through influencing the initial decision of which Social Engineering intervention to use. The influence of marketing communications is considered using diffusion theory, which uncovers how marketing communications diffuse through and influence a decision making group. First, the research uncovers the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. This is the decision making process of Governments for Social Engineering Decisions. The Social Engineering Decision Making Process is the combination of Podg&#243;recki&#8217;s Sociotechnical Paradigm (1990) and Roger&#8217;s Innovation Diffusion Process (2003). The research then explores this framework through its illustration in a retailing context. The Social Engineering intervention chosen for this research is the shop trading hour legislation in New Zealand. The Social Engineering decision studied is the decision to introduce Sunday trading through the Shop Trading Hours Act Repeal Act (1990). An historical analysis explores the Social Engineering of shop trading hours, in line with an Historical methodology and Constructivist and Hermeneutic viewpoint. This narrative is created through document analysis and semi-structured in-depth interviews with five different stakeholder groups from the decision to introduce Sunday trading. The historical narrative also illustrates the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Lastly, to uncover the influence of marketing communications and the media on the Social Engineering Decision Making Process, a content analysis of marketing communications and media over the time of the decision to introduce Sunday trading occurs. Government discussions and reports regarding the decision are also analysed. If the communications influence the Government discussions, then their themes would be present in Government documents directly following the communications. The results lend support to the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Results outline the aspects of the legislative process that reflect each stage of the Social Engineering Decision Making Process. Findings also find support for the influence of Marketing communications and media on the Government&#8217;s decision making. The three most effective times for stakeholders to try to influence the process, through either mass or interpersonal communications are also identified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Social engineering</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Historical marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hiding in a hollow tree</field><field name="creator">Kenobi, Ben Tuhoe</field><field name="description">Starting with a broad analysis of game story-telling methods, this project seeks to interrogate a player&#8217;s occupation and navigation of the possibility space of a game&#8217;s meta-narrative and isolate &#8216;story-telling&#8217; techniques specific and inherent to the computer-game medium.

Strategies that have been implicated in reducing either the magnitude of vertical ground reaction force (vertical GRF) or the time taken to reach the maximum vertical GRF in the stepping leg were explored. Study Design: The study was an experimental, laboratory based, repeated measures design. Participants: Twenty participants took part in this exploratory study. Ten in the older group of 60-80 years, mean 65.3 (SD 5) years and ten in the younger age group of 20-30 years, mean 22.8 (SD 2.5) years. Main Measures: The vertical GRF and the time taken to reach maximum vertical GRF were measured to ascertain impact during step descent. Electromyography and kinematic variables were measured to determine the effect they may have on the impact. The variables measured were the maximum joint range of motion of the hip and knee during early stance in step descent. Surface electromyography from four lower limb muscles was recorded to ascertain the magnitude of muscle activity at impact. The relationship in an antero-posterior direction of the upper body and stepping leg at initial contact (IC) was also investigated. Results: There was a significant difference in both the amount of knee flexion and the amount of activity of the vastus lateralis muscle during impact between older and younger adults. Older adults had significantly less knee flexion during a step descent activity than younger adults (F(1,18)=5.48; p=.031).Older adults had significantly more vastus lateralis activity during a step descent activity than younger adults (F(1,18)=5.21; p=.035). Conclusions: Older and younger adults use different strategies in both muscle activation and joint range of motion around the knee of the leading leg during the step descent. Older adults used more vastus lateralis activity perhaps to increase stiffness in the knee, leading to a reduction in range of motion at impact. Although no change in vertical GRF was detected in this study, both of these strategies have the potential to increase the impact of a step and therefore cause jarring and possible damage. This study recruited healthy active older adults and differences in impact may be observed in an older or less active population, or in those with joint pathology such as osteoarthritis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Step descent</field><field name="subject">Vertical ground reaction force</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying an integrated communications approach to

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout.

In Malaysia, the community-based homestay programme, which is a collective project undertaken by community members, is promoted to rural villages by the Malaysian government as a development strategy. In fact, the homestay programme has the potential to generate additional income for the villagers and provide an avenue for them to participate in tourism development. It also offers cultural exchange between the hosts and the guests, and incorporates the surrounding environment, including farms and the rural landscape, as the main attractions. Nevertheless, research on the Malaysian homestay programme as a development strategy is scarce and predominantly focuses on villages with programmes that are performing well in terms of generating tourist revenue. Although it may be economically viable, economic criterion alone does not guarantee that the programme and the community will be sustainable in the future, justifying the sustainable community development focus of this thesis. Sustainable community development is based on the principle that the community is able to utilise its resources while ensuring future generations have enough resources, reflecting the concepts of equity, a development by the people and for the people, and self-sufficiency. Consequently, three important issues are addressed in this thesis; 1) the distribution of costs and benefits among local people, 2) the nature of local participation, and 3) the self-reliance of the community. In framing the issues, the thesis is underpinned by several theories relating to earlier development theories, sustainable tourism development, sustainable community development, and pro-poor tourism. Unlike previous research which concentrated primarily on the host group with only minor representation from other village members, this thesis seeks to assess all groups in the village; the host, non-host and non-participant. A total of 90 interviews were undertaken in three different categories of homestay villages, in addition to another 10 interviews with representatives from the government and the Malaysian Homestay Association. Semi-structured interviews provided primary data for this study while secondary data was sourced from document analysis. Consequently, the multiple data collection method, including field notes, and various types of data heighten the credibility of this research through triangulation. To provide a framework for the discussion, the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (DFID, 1999) was applied to analyse the strengths and weaknesses of each homestay village. Overall, the results of this research reveal that the homestay programme is not able to contribute to sustainable community development when it is not accepted by all members of the community. Based on the results, this thesis proposes a framework towards an improvement in the organisation, the management and the community of homestay through an assessment and monitoring system. By implementing the concepts in the proposed Sustainable Livelihoods Framework for Homestay Programme (SLF-HP), it is hoped that such programmes will increase, sustain and expand the benefits to a larger number of community members.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sustainable community development, community participation, community-based homestay programme, sustainable livelihoods.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do Better Institutions Alleviate the Resource Curse? Evidence from a Dynamic Panel Approach.</field><field name="creator">Malebogo Bakwena</field><field name="description">Contrary to conventional theory, a growing body of evidence suggests that economies with abundant natural resources perform badly in terms of economic growth relative to their resource poor counterparts&#8212;the so-called resource curse hypothesis. However, this general hypothesis is not robust. It clearly fails to account for the differing experiences of resource abundant economies. For instance, the theory, applied generally, offers no explanation as to why economies like Botswana and Norway have exceptional growth while Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have stagnated. Prompted by these experiences, the thesis investigates the circumstances under which the curse is more or less likely to exist. In particular, the thesis finds evidence that the major reason for the diverging experiences is the differences in the quality of institutions across countries. The thesis tests the hypothesis that the effect of resources on growth is conditional on the type and quality of institutions, by further building on Boschini, Pettersson, and Roine&#8217;s (2007) and Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik&#8217;s (2006b) influential works on the role of institutions in mitigating the resource curse. Advances are made by: (a) using a panel of up to 53 countries with different levels of development, institutional quality and natural resource abundance over the period 1984-2003; (b) applying a two-step system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation that accounts for biases associated with omitted variables, endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity that potentially affect existing cross-country Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) growth results; (c) supplementing results of the commonly used International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) institutional performance indicators with those of institutional design indicators&#8211;that is, highlighting the role of electoral rules and form of government; (d) using an institutional quality measure that is more related to financial institutions than just economic or political institutions; (e) using a resource abundance indicator that focuses on non-renewable resources alone rather than the ones commonly used in the literature that include renewable resources, which are inappropriate. The key hypothesis that natural resource economies are not destined to be cursed if they have good institutions is confirmed by the empirical results of the thesis. Specifically, the results suggest that (a) adopting a democratic regime is better than a non-democratic one, in terms of generating growth from resource abundance (b) the electoral rules that a country adopts matter, i.e. having a democratic proportional rather than a democratic majority regime increases the growth benefits of resource abundance (c) as far as the form of government adopted is concerned, a democratic parliamentary rather than a democratic presidential regime generates more economic growth from its abundant natural resource (d) a well functioning banking sector induces more (resource abundant generated) growth and capital accumulation. Therefore, the lessons for policy makers who struggle to overcome the impediments to economic development that potentially accompany the &#8220;curse of resource abundance&#8221; are the need to develop and maintain better institutions and adopt improved management strategies of the financial proceeds forthcoming from such abundance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">(institutional quality, resource curse, dynamic panel, generalised method of moments)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Varicella-Zoster Virus evasion of the Interferon immune response</field><field name="creator">Aaron Irving</field><field name="description">Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to antagonize the interferon (IFN) system, targeting all the major components involved in receptor binding and signalling. Although a number of these viral proteins are homologous to cellular proteins involved in IFN downregulation (e.g., viral IFN regulatory factors [vIRFs]), many share little resemblance to known proteins. To determine the IFN-blocking properties of these proteins, functional assays are required. Here, we present a new and rapid functional screening method, based on the 2FTGH cell line, which is able to determine viral gene products that inhibit the IFN-alpha/Jak-Stat signalling pathway. Expression cloning of viral IFN-blocking genes into 2FTGH and consequent selection with IFN-alpha and 6-thioguanine result in the outgrowth of cells that are no longer responsive to IFN-alpha. We also demonstrate that selection occurs if members of the Jak-Stat signalling pathway are lost. To show the utility of our system, we have used a known suppressor of IFN signalling, the human papillomavirus (HPV) E7 gene. Expression of E7 causes the loss of ability of 2FTGH cells to respond to IFN-alpha treatment because of a functional disruption of the signalling pathway. This approach offers a new strategy for identifying novel viral genes or new functions of already described viral genes that have a role in IFN-alpha signalling inhibition.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interferon, virus, screening, system, varicella-zoster, orf63, vzv, ifn, 2ftgh, isg</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic Models for the Analysis of Quantitative Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="creator">Denis Bauer</field><field name="description">Understanding transcriptional regulation quantitatively is a crucial step towards uncovering and ultimately utilizing the regulatory semantics encoded in the genome. Transcription of a gene is induced by the binding of site-specific transcription factors (TFs) to so-called cis-regulatory-modules (CRMs). The frequency and duration of the binding events are influenced by the concentrations of the TFs, the binding affinities and location of the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the CRM as well as the properties of the TFs themselves (e.g. effectiveness, competitive interaction with other TFs). Modeling these interactions using a mathematical approach, based on sound biochemical and thermodynamic foundations, enables the understanding and quantitative prediction of transcriptional output of a target gene. In the thesis I introduce the developed framework for modeling, visualizing, and predicting the regulation of the transcription rate of a target gene. Given the concentrations of a set of TFs, the TFBSs in a regulatory DNA region, and the transcription rate of the target gene, the method will optimize its parameters to generate a predictive model that incorporates the regulatory mechanism of the observed gene. I demonstrate the generalization ability of the model by subjecting it to standard machine learning and hypothesis testing procedures. Furthermore, I demonstrate the potential of the approach by training the method on a gene in D. melanogaster and predicting the output of the homologous genes in 12 other Drosophila species where the regulatory sequence has evolved substantially but the regulatory mechanism was conserved. Finally, I investigate the proposed role-switching behaviour of TFs regulating the development of D. melanogaster, which suggests that SUMOylation is the biological mechanism facilitating the switch.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="subject">Gene Regulation</field><field name="subject">Transcription Factor</field><field name="subject">Thermodynamic modeling</field><field name="subject">Optimization Problems</field><field name="subject">Comparative Genomics</field><field name="subject">Evolution and phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">SUMOylation</field><field name="subject">D. melanogaster</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Hubterranean View of Syntax: An Analysis of Linguistic Form through Network Theory</field><field name="creator">Julie Louise Steele</field><field name="description">Language is part of nature, and as such, certain general principles that generate the form of natural systems, will also create the patterns found within linguistic form. Since network theory is one of the best theoretical frameworks for extracting general principles from diverse systems, this thesis examines how a network perspective can shed light on the characteristics and the learning of syntax. It is demonstrated that two word co-occurrence networks constructed from adult and child speech (BNC World Edition 2001; Sachs 1983; MacWhinney 2000a) exhibit three non-atomic syntactic primitives namely, the truncated power law distributions of frequency, degree and the link length between two nodes (the link representing a precedence relation). Since a power law distribution of link lengths characterises a hubterranean structure (Kasturirangan 1999) i.e. a structure that has a few highly connected nodes and many poorly connected nodes, both the adult and the child word co-occurrence networks exhibit hubterranean structure. This structure is formed by an optimisation process that minimises the link length whilst maximising connectivity (Mathias &amp; Gopal 2001 a&amp;b). The link length in a word co-occurrence network is the storage cost of representing two adjacently co-occurring words and is inversely proportion to the transitional probability (TP) of the word pair. Adjacent words that co-occur often together i.e. have a high TP, exhibit a high cohesion and tend to form chunks. These chunks are a cost effective method of storing representations. Thus, on this view, the (multi-) power law of link lengths represents the distribution of storage costs or cohesions within adjacent words. Such cohesions form groupings of linguistic form known as syntactic constituents. Thus, syntactic constituency is not specific to language and is a property derived from the optimisation of the network. In keeping with other systems generated by a cost constraint on the link length, it is demonstrated that both the child and adult word co-occurrence networks are not hierarchically organised in terms of degree distribution (Ravasz and Barab&#225;si 2003:1). Furthermore, both networks are disassortative, and in line with other disassortative networks, there is a correlation between degree and betweenness centrality (BC) values (Goh, Kahng and Kim 2003). In agreement with scale free networks (Goh, Oh, Jeong, Kahng and Kim 2002), the BC values in both networks follow a power law distribution. In this thesis, a motif analysis of the two word co-occurrence networks is a richly detailed (non-functional) distributional analysis and reveals that the adult and child significance profiles for triad subgraphs correlate closely. Furthermore, the most significant 4-node motifs in the adult network are also the most significant in the child network. Utilising this non-functional distributional analysis in a word co-occurrence network, it is argued that the notion of a general syntactic category is not evidenced and as such is inadmissible. Thus, non-general or construction-specific categories are preferred (in line with Croft 2001). Function words tend to be the hub words of the network (see Ferrer i Cancho and Sol&#233; 2001a), being defined and therefore identified by their high type and token frequency. These properties are useful for identifying syntactic categories since function words are traditionally associated with particular syntactic categories (see Cann 2000). Consequently, a function word and thus a syntactic category may be identified by the interception of the frequency and degree power laws with their truncated tails. As a given syntactic category captures the type of words that may co-occur with the function word, the category then encourages consistency within the functional patterns in the network and re-enforces the network&#8217;s (near-) optimised state. Syntax then, on this view, is both a navigator, manoeuvring through the ever varying sea of linguistic form and a guide, forging an uncharted course through novel expression. There is also evidence suggesting that the hubterranean structure is not only found in the word co-occurrence network, but within other theoretical syntactic levels. Factors affecting the choice of a verb that is generalised early relate to the formation and the characteristics of hubs. In that, the property of a high (token) frequency in combination with either a high degree (type frequency) or a low storage cost, point to certain verbs within the network and these highly &#8216;visible&#8217; verbs tend to be generalised early (in line with Boyd and Goldberg forthcoming). Furthermore, the optimisation process that creates hubterranean structure is implicated in the verb-construction subpart network of the adult&#8217;s linguistic knowledge, the mapping of the constructions&#8217; form-to-meaning pairings, the construction inventory size as well as certain strategies aiding first language learning and adult artificial language learning.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">20 Language, Communication and Culture</field><field name="subject">syntax, network theory, child language, power laws, frequency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male Risk Taking as a Sexual Display Strategy: Proximal and Distal Explanations for Young Men's Risk Taking</field><field name="creator">Richard Ronay</field><field name="description">This research explores whether male risk taking emerges as a sexual display strategy in the presence of attractive women. Experiments 1 to 3 explored whether young males reported and engaged in more risk taking after viewing pictures of highly attractive females. Possible self-control mechanisms were investigated via working memory, reversal learning, and Stroop tasks. In addition, second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) was measured as a proxy for individual differences in testosterone. Viewing pictures of highly attractive females led to greater self-reported risk-taking. 2D:4D was found to moderate the effect on risk-taking behaviours, with increases for high, but decreases for low testosterone males. Digit ratio also moderated the effects observed on the Stroop and reversal learning tasks. Experiments 4 and 5 extended these findings to examine how power interacts with testosterone to influence risk taking and inhibitory control. As testosterone is as-sociated with the pursuit of power and status (Dabbs &amp; Dabbs, 2000), high testoster-one individuals primed with power were expected to have little reason to disrupt the status quo and thus should be risk-avoidant. Conversely, high-testosterone individuals primed with low power were expected to use risk taking as a vehicle for pursuing po-tential gains to their status and resources. The findings from two experiments are con-sistent with these predictions. In Experiment 1, higher testosterone males (as indicated by second&#8211;fourth digit ratio) showed greater risk-taking when primed with low power. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and also showed that when primed with high power, higher testosterone males took fewer risks. The influence of power on Stroop performance was also moderated by individual differences in testosterone. Par-ticipants primed with high power showed better Stroop performance if they were lower in testosterone, whereas participants primed with low power showed better Stroop performance if they were higher in testosterone. These results suggest that greater executive control accompanies but does not underlie enhanced risk taking, caused by testosterone and power. Finally, results from a field experiment (Experiment 6) with skateboarders demon-strate that physical risk taking by young male skateboarders increases in the presence of an attractive female. This increased risk taking led to more successes but also more crash landings in front of the female observer. Mediational analyses suggest that this increase in risk taking is caused in part by elevated testosterone levels of men who performed in front of the attractive female. In addition, skateboarders&#8217; risk taking was predicted by their performance on a reversal-learning task, reversal-learning perform-ance was disrupted by the presence of the attractive female, and the female&#8217;s presence moderated the observed relationship between risk taking and reversal learning. These results suggest that men use physical risk taking as a sexual display strategy, and they provide suggestive evidence regarding possible hormonal and neural mechanisms.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">risk taking, testosterone, 2D:4D, executive control, sexual competition, power</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stepping stones towards linear optical quantum computing</field><field name="creator">Till Weinhold</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis form an investigation into the path towards establishing the requirements of quantum computing in a linear optical system. Our qubits are polarisation encoded photons for which the basic operations of quantum computing, single qubit rotations, are a well understood problem. The difficulty lies in the interaction of photons. To achieve these we use measurement induced non-linearities. The first experiment in this thesis describes the thorough characterisation of a controlled-sign gate based on such non-linearities. The photons are provided as pairs generated through parametric down-conversion, and as such share correlations unlikely to carry over into large scale implementations of the future. En route to such larger circuits, a characterisation of the actions of the controlled-sign gate is conducted, when the input qubits have been generated independently from each other, revealing a large drop in process fidelity. To explore the cause of this degradation of the gate performance a thorough and highly accurate model of the gate is derived including the realistic description of faulty circuitry, photon loss and multi-photon emission by the source. By simulating the effects of the various noise sources individually, the heretofore largely ignored multi-photon emission is identified as the prime cause of the degraded gate performance, causing a drop in fidelity nearly three times as large as any other error source. I further draw the first comparison between the performance of an experimental gate to the error probabilities per gate derived as thresholds for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In the absence of a single vigourous threshold value, I compare the gate performance to the models that yielded the highest threshold to date as an upper bound and to the threshold of the Gremlin-model, which allows for the most general errors. Unsurprisingly this comparison reveals that the implemented gate is clearly insufficient, however just remedying the multi-photon emission error will allow this architecture to move to within striking distance of the boundary for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The utilised methodology can be applied to any gate in any architecture and can, combined with a suitable model of the noise sources, become an important guide for developments required to achieve fault tolerant quantum computing. The final experiment on the path towards linear optical quantum computing is the demonstration of a pair of basic versions of Shor's algorithm which display the essential entanglement for the algorithm. The results again highlight the need for extensive measurements to reveal the fundamental quality of the implemented algorithm, which is not accessible with limited indicative measurements. In the second part of the thesis, I describe two experiments on other forms of entanglement by extending the actions of a Fock-State filter, a filter that is capable of attenuating single photon states stronger than multi-photon states, to produce entangled states. Furthermore this device can be used in conjunction with standard wave-plates to extend the range of operations possible on the bi-photonic qutrit space, showing that this setup suffices to produce any desired qutrit state, thereby giving access to new measurement capabilities and in the process creating and proving the first entanglement between a qubit and a qutrit.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum information</field><field name="subject">quantum optics</field><field name="subject">Quantum computing</field><field name="subject">Linear optical quantum computing</field><field name="subject">Pulsed Parametric Down-conversion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Manumalo:a study of factors which facilitate success for New Zealand - born Samoan students at university</field><field name="creator">Penn, Rosemarie</field><field name="description">This thesis is about factors which aid and hinder successful completions for New Zealand-born Samoans. The thesis explores the proposition that educational marginalisation of minority students will be perpetuated until AUT adopts policies and procedures which enable culturally responsive educational pedagogies and practices which honour indigenous minorities. The thesis asked New Zealand-born Samoan students, what is the nature of their aiga (family) and cultural support frameworks (structures), and, further, to what extent and how and why do these students engage with such networks (processes)? This study used a qualitative approach within which six New Zealand-born Samoan students were interviewed using a semi-structured approach to gathering data. The interview data were transcribed and a thematic analysis was manually completed both within and across the six cases. The turnaround time in gaining ethics approval impacted upon the capacity of the investigator to conduct this research in what she considered to be a culturally appropriate manner and the cautious vigilance of the final ethics committee approval was perceived as a barrier to making culturally appropriate contact. It was discovered that Samoan structures, especially family, are paramount in supporting educational success because of the Fa&#8217;a Samoa processes which they engender. A further discovery was that New Zealand-born Samoans retain cultural affiliations so their lifestyle shows deep regard for Fa&#8217;a Samoa identity. Through these affiliations, meaningful life metaphors become applied. It was concluded that transforming staff so that they understand Pasifika peoples is crucial to growing Pasifika educational success. Staff development must, therefore, be planned so that meaningful understandings of Pasifika concepts and frameworks become nurtured and that is a challenge which AUT must embrace and action.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand-born Samoan</field><field name="subject">Tertiary education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/889</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Fucoidin efficacy in A&#946;-peptide induced Alzheimer&#8217;s disease rodent model</field><field name="creator">Aarti Patel</field><field name="description">Abstract Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a major public health concern worldwide, with an increasing prevalence in the elderly population. AD is a progressive neurological disorder of multi-faceted origin, where factors such as genetic mutations, biochemical changes, along with inflammatory cascade and soluble beta amyloid (A&#946;) peptide, are thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic failure and neuronal death, ultimately leading to cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline in patients suffering from the disease. At present, there is no long-term cure for the disease, although there is access to pharmacotherapy that might improve cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms early in the course of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy for AD only provides symptomatic relief for a very short period of time. It is therefore of utmost importance to discover other pharmacological strategies that might delay the development of AD and slow down the disease progression in terms of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in AD neuropathogenesis is a major goal to find efficacious disease-modifying treatments. What remains to be understood completely are the intracellular pathways affected by A&#946; protein which may lead to neurodegeneration in AD. Since phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms are crucial in the &#946;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, protein kinase C has emerged as one of the key regulators of the APP metabolism. Indeed, dysregulation of the PKC pathway might play a role in the intracellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration, but their effective involvement still remains elusive. Therefore, a detailed analysis of PKC pathways in established models of AD neurodegeneration is necessary and will form part of this work. Fucoidin is a sulphated polysaccharide extracted from edible brown seaweed, which has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as being a neuroprotectant in various inflammatory diseases including hypoxic ischemia, atherosclerosis and Heyman nephritis. Therefore, fucoidin may have an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory mechanisms of AD. Little is known, however, about the effect of fucoidin on AD. Animal models of AD are extremely valuable for the discovery and development of new treatments. Rodents have been one of the preferred models for pharmacological and behavioural studies in AD. In this thesis, first aim was to establish a non-transgenic A&#946;-induced AD model in rats. AD was induced utilising a published protocol which involved the bilateral injection of aggregated A&#946; (1-42) into the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in rat brain. Behavioural assessment with well defined tools such as the Morris water maze and T-maze were utilised to assess the impairment in spatial working memory in rats. Behavioural impairments along with increased astrocytosis and microgliosis were observed in this particular A&#946;-induced AD model. In the established disease model, fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day) and ibuprofen (50 mg/kg/day) were shown to provide a partial protective effect on impairment in memory function in the MWM behavioural task in rats treated prior to disease initiation and throughout the course of the study. In addition, the histopathological and quantitative analysis of AD brain sections showed a marked reduction in reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglia in fucoidin (low and high dose) and ibuprofen treated A&#946; injected rats compared to untreated A&#946; injected rats. These results indicate that fucoidin may serve as a possible effective therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. There is strong evidence that PKC &#945; and &#949; signalling pathways regulate important molecular events in memory impairment and neurodegenerative pathophysiology in AD. A possible neuroprotective mechanism of fucoidin involving attenuation of an A&#946;-induced decrease in PKC &#949; phosphorylation using cultured SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells as a model system was examined. Co-administration of fucoidin (2&#956;M and 5 &#956;M) with A&#946; (1&#956;M) abolished the inhibitory effect of A&#946; on the phosphorylation of PKC&#949; in a concentration-dependent manner as revealed by western blot analysis. These findings suggest that a possible mechanism underpinning the neuroprotective effect of fucoidin may be through prevention of A&#61538;-induced inhibition of PKC phosphorylation and may serve as a possible therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. As cellular events that involve PKC are affected by A&#946; in in vitro systems, it was necessary to examine whether PKC activity is also modulated by the A&#946; treatment in vivo in our A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Therefore, the next aim was to assess the potential for fucoidin use as an intervention therapy in an established disease stage in the A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Intervention with fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in the established disease stage partially prevented A&#946; (1-42) mediated damage with respect to memory impairment, neuroinflammation and PKC &#949; phosphorylation in the in vivo AD model consistent with the in vitro findings in SHSY5Y cells.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer Disease, amyloid beta peptide, fucoidin, PKC</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ovarian cancer and diet: from nutrients to lifestyle</field><field name="creator">Fariba Kolahdooz</field><field name="description">Abstract Ovarian cancer is the 6th most common cancer in women worldwide and mortality from this cancer is high, because early diagnosis is difficult (Sankaranarayanan et al. 2006). Thus, identification of modifiable factors contributing to its aetiology is important in reducing the burden of a very fatal form of women&#8217;s cancer. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate the association between diet and ovarian cancer risk within the context of a framework &#8216;from nutrients to lifestyle&#8217;. The study examined dietary and lifestyle factors that had not previously been investigated comprehensively in four main areas: nutrients (retinol, beta-carotene, vitamins E, C, and B), foods (fruit, vegetables, dairy products, eggs, meat and liver), diet patterns and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, and body-mass-index). The study used the data from two population-based case-control studies of women aged 18-79 years conducted in Australia 10 years apart; the Survey of Women&#8217;s Health (SWH, 1990-1993) involves 683 cases and 777 controls, and the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study (AOCS, 2002-2005) includes 1329 cases and 1397 controls. Cases were recruited from gynaecological oncology treatment centres and controls were selected at random from the electoral roll. Detailed information on non-dietary risk factors was obtained using a questionnaire and dietary information was obtained via a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (adjusting for age, parity, oral contraceptive use, education, and energy intake) for ovarian cancer risk were estimated separately for each study with logistic regression modelling and weighted pooled risk estimates for the two studies were calculated using fixed-effects models. Principal components analysis of around 40 food groups was performed to identify dietary patterns in each study separately. There was an increased risk of ovarian cancer associated with retinol intake in both studies (combined OR for the highest vs. lowest quartile =1.42, 95%CI 1.19-1.69), while intake of beta-carotene was inversely related to cancer risk (combined OR=0.80, 95%CI 0.67-0.96). The associations between retinol and beta-carotene and risk appeared to be independent. Liver was also associated with an increased risk; however this association seemed to be explained by the high levels of retinol in liver. Dairy products and eggs are other good sources of retinol, but no clear relations were seen and additional adjustment for saturated fat further attenuated the associations. High vitamin E intake (combined OR=0.73, 95%CI 0.61-0.87) was associated with a decreased risk, but no overall association was seen for vitamin C (combined OR=1.06, 95%CI 0.89-1.27). It is noteworthy that vitamin C seemed to be more beneficial for current smokers than for never/past smokers. For the B vitamins, a significant inverse association was apparent only for niacin intake (combined OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.58-0.82). While there was no association between cancer risk and sources of niacin such as total meat and red meat, other niacin-rich foods such as poultry (combined OR=0.77, 95%CI 0.66-0.89) and fish (combined OR=0.83, 95%CI 0.71-0.97) were significantly inversely associated with risk. In contrast to poultry and fish, high consumption of processed meat was associated with a 24% increase in risk (combined OR=1.24, 95%CI 1.06-1.45). Total fruit (combined OR=0.75, 95%CI 0.60-0.94) and total vegetables (combined OR=0.69, 95%CI 0.52-0.92), specifically cruciferous vegetables (combined OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.63-0.98) and green leafy vegetables (combined OR=0.79, 95%CI 0.67-0.94), were associated with a modestly decreased risk, whereas the inverse association between red/yellow vegetables and risk did not quite reach statistical significance (combined OR=0.84, 95%CI 0.64-1.08). High fruit intake was, like vitamin C intake, somewhat more beneficial for current/past smokers than for never smokers. Exclusion of women who took dietary supplements did not substantially change the observed associations between nutrients and risk. Three major eating patterns were identified: &#8216;snacks and alcohol&#8217;, &#8216;fruit and vegetable&#8217;, and &#8216;meat and fat&#8217;. Significant inverse associations between the snacks and alcohol pattern and risk were attenuated after further adjustment for white/red wine intake in both studies; it thus appeared that the observed association was at least partly due to wine intake. A significant association between the fruit and vegetable pattern and risk was seen only in the more recent study. A diet characterized by high meat and fat was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, although the observed association was stronger in the SWH There was no evidence that the associations between diet pattern and cancer risk varied by women&#8217;s lifestyle. Although there was some variation in the analyses stratified by the histologic subtype of ovarian cancer, no consistent patterns of variation were observed for either study. These findings provide additional evidence that a healthy diet defined by high intake of fruit, vegetables, particularly cruciferous and green leafy vegetables, white meat and fish and low in meat and fat, especially processed meats might be beneficial against ovarian cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diet, nutrient, food group, diet pattern, lifestyle, ovarian neoplasm, cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Third-Party Disability in Spouses of Older People with Hearing Impairment</field><field name="creator">Nerina Scarinci</field><field name="description">Hearing impairment is the most common communication disability in older people. The wide-ranging impact of hearing impairment on communication means that not only does the person with hearing impairment experience the consequences but also his or her frequent communication partners. This thesis investigates the impact of hearing impairment on spouses and uses the World Health Organization&#8217;s term &#8220;third-party disability.&#8221; Third-party disability is defined as the impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions experienced by the family due to the health condition of their significant other, and was identified by the World Health Organization as an area for future development and application of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Despite a number of studies previously published on the effect of hearing impairment on family members, including younger couples and carers, there remain substantial gaps in knowledge and understanding of the difficulties specifically relating to older people and factors associated with third-party hearing disability. This thesis focuses on the third-party disability experienced by normally hearing spouses (termed the &#8220;spouses&#8221; in this thesis) of older people with hearing impairment (termed the &#8220;partners&#8221; in this thesis). To add empirical data to the body of research, this series of studies first explored the lived experience of spouses of older people with hearing impairment in a qualitative study, then identified the ICF domains and categories that described third-party hearing disability, described the extent of third-party hearing disability in this population, modelled the contribution of factors to third-party hearing disability, and developed and psychometrically tested a scale to measure the third-party disability of spouses of older people with hearing impairment. Studies conducted within this thesis were therefore completed in two phases. Ten spouses of older people with hearing impairment participated in the first qualitative phase, consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Results of this study showed that spouses experience a number of effects as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment including: (1) the broad ranging effects of the hearing impairment on the spouses&#8217; everyday lives; (2) the spouses&#8217; need to constantly adapt to their partners&#8217; hearing impairment; (3) the effect of acceptance of the hearing impairment on the spouse; and (4) the impact of ageing and retirement. Findings were then linked to the ICF to identify the most typical and relevant domains and categories of the ICF for spouses of older people with hearing impairment. The majority of themes were able to be linked to the ICF, with most linking to codes in the activities and participation component. A number of contextual factors were also identified that influenced the spouses&#8217; third-party disability. In the second phase, a further 100 older couples affected by hearing impairment participated in a quantitative face-to-face survey to describe the nature and degree of third-party disability in spouses, and to examine factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Concepts identified in the first qualitative study were used to formulate a 36-item tool for measuring spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability, namely the Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability (SOS-HEAR). The majority of spouses in this study (98%) reported some degree of third-party hearing disability on at least one item of the SOS-HEAR. Communication difficulties between the couple were the central source of stress reported by spouses, followed by emotional problems in the spouse. Three factors were found to be significantly associated with greater third-party hearing disability: (1) lower relationship satisfaction as described by spouses; (2) a larger spouse-partner age difference; and (3) greater hearing disability in the hearing impaired partner as perceived by the spouse. The scaling properties of the SOS-HEAR were then examined, with a revised 27-item questionnaire found to be a reliable means of measuring older spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability. Use of the SOS-HEAR is proposed as a means of identifying spouses of older people with hearing impairment in need of intervention. If spouses are identified as experiencing third-party hearing disability, health professionals are then in a position to facilitate discussions with the couple about the impact of the hearing loss on their daily functioning. The inclusion of spouses in rehabilitation takes into account the needs of both members of the couple such that they become partners in rehabilitation. In summary, this research has shown that hearing impairment in older people has an effect on the spouse, as they too experience situations of communication activity limitations and participation restrictions. It is clear that the lives of participants in this study were considerably affected as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment, with spouses reporting a wide variety of stresses involving lifestyle changes, communication difficulties, and emotional consequences. This series of studies has highlighted the potentially important role of family-centred intervention in rehabilitation for older adults with hearing impairment, and strongly suggests the need for increased inclusion of spouses and significant others in the rehabilitation process.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">third-party disability</field><field name="subject">hearing impairment</field><field name="subject">ICF</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">spouses</field><field name="subject">significant others</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">psychosocial factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Addiction Neuroethics: The Promises and Perils of Neuroscience Research on Addiction</field><field name="creator">Adrian Carter</field><field name="description">Drug addiction is a significant problem facing most societies. It is associated with increased violence, crime and mental illness, and is one of the leading causes of preventable mortality and disability in most developed societies, accounting for over 12% of the total burden of disease (Begg et al., 2007). Neuroscience promises to significantly reduce the incidence and severity of addictive drug use, and the harm that it causes, by providing more effective and better targeted treatment of addiction (Volkow and Li, 2005). Proponents argue that an increased understanding of the neurobiological basis of drug addiction will also lend support for more humane social policies. These policies will recognise that addiction is a neuropsychiatric condition that should be treated therapeutically, leading to increased investment in addiction research and treatment (Dackis and O'Brien, 2005; McLellan et al., 2000). Optimism about the benefits of an understanding of the neurobiological basis of addiction needs to be tempered by more critical considerations. Overly simplistic interpretations of what this kind of approach reveals about addiction could result in less welcome consequences, especially if inappropriate use is made of emerging neurotechnologies, such as coerced use of naltrexone implants, population-wide vaccination programs against addiction, or the promotion of heroic &#8216;cures&#8217; for addiction, such as neurosurgery and deep brain stimulation. This thesis examines both the potentially welcome and unwelcome uses of neurobiological research of addiction with the aims of maximising the benefits, while minimizing any unanticipated harms. I refer to this as Addiction Neuroethics. The primary aims are to examine: (1) the impact that neuroscience research may have upon our understanding of autonomy and self-control in addicted individuals, (2) the implications this understanding may have for how we treat individuals with an addiction; and (3) the conditions under which it would be ethically acceptable to use various technologies emerging from this research. This thesis falls into three parts. First, a concise and accessible summary of the key findings of recent genetic and neuroscience research of addiction is provided. This includes the neuroanatomy of addiction (e.g. the mesolimbic reward pathway), the molecular and cellular biology of addiction, neurocognitive changes, and the role of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities. The second part of this thesis explores how neuroscience research may influence the way that modern societies think about drug use and addiction, and deal with those that suffer from it. This section addresses the central question: do addicted persons have the capacity to make autonomous decisions regarding their own drug use? This raises a number of additional questions. How much responsibility and blame should we attribute to addicted individual&#8217;s for their actions? How should society deal with addicted persons, or respond to the harm that they cause? Should society coerce addicted individuals into treatment, and if so, under what conditions? The third part of this thesis examines the ethical issues raised by the use of powerful new technologies that are emerging from neurobiological research on addiction, such as novel psychopharmacologies, depot implants, drug vaccines, neurosurgery and brain stimulation, neuroimaging and genetic testing. The report also considers the more speculative possibility that addiction neurobiology may improve our ability to prevent the development of addiction, for example, by using genetic screening to identify individuals at high risk of addiction and &#8216;drug vaccines&#8217; to prevent these individuals from becoming addicted. This thesis demonstrates that the chronic use of addictive drugs has significant impacts upon key decision-making regions of the brain (e.g. motivation, memory, impulse inhibition) that affect addicted individuals ability to choose not to use drugs. While the autonomy of addicted individuals is impaired in certain situations, and to varying degrees, it is not extinguished. Rather than deny autonomy, we should aim to engage addicted individuals in ways that increase their autonomy. For example, coerced treatment of addiction may be a valid approach to getting addicted individuals in treatment. However we should avoid overriding the autonomy of addicted individuals by offering treatment as an alternative to punishment for some crimes (e.g. theft to fund drug habit). Such treatment should aim to treat a medical condition, and not be a form of extrajudicial punishment. Addiction is a highly stigmatised condition. This can significantly impact upon the way in which neuroscience research is understood and applied. Scientists, clinicians and policy makers must be mindful of over-enthusiastic applications of novel technologies that may be prematurely embraced and promoted to a desperate and vulnerable population without proper evaluation of the risks, or without considering how these technologies may be used once approved. The treatment of addiction should be judged by its efficacy and safety, as for any other medical treatment. Addicted individuals should be treated as any other individual suffering from a medical condition. The thesis concludes with some general suggestions about the directions in which this debate is likely to develop and identifies areas that will require further analysis and empirical investigation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">addiction</field><field name="subject">neuroethics</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">consent</field><field name="subject">coercion</field><field name="subject">rights</field><field name="subject">neuroscience</field><field name="subject">treatment</field><field name="subject">prevention</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James V. Forrestal as Cold War Policymaker: A Re-Assessment</field><field name="creator">Belinda Lohrisch</field><field name="description">This thesis critically examines the career and significance of America&#8217;s first Secretary of Defence James V. Forrestal from a post-Cold War perspective. Within traditional Cold War scholarship, Forrestal&#8217;s legacy is problematic. The nature of his role as a defence administrator, combined with his suicide in 1949, has led scholars to underestimate his significance and relegate his legacy to the occasional biography. The few studies that examine his contribution utilise conventional analytical approaches that fail to fully assess his policymaking impact. The end of the Cold War, however, has brought additional insight into the policy concerns that dominated the conflict, new analytical approaches to its scholarship and fresh material on which to base a re-assessment. As this thesis demonstrates, the employment of new methodologies to study Forrestal&#8217;s impact is long overdue. By drawing on theories specifically related to leadership and decision-making behaviour, this thesis brings a deeper, fuller understanding of Forrestal&#8217;s policy-making impact as a Cold War official through an examination of his professional conduct. Despite Forrestal&#8217;s many successes, political controversies surrounding his defence career overshadowed his many achievements. This thesis argues that such controversies were the result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication as a public official, his policy-making and management styles, and the structure of his authority as defence secretary. They were not, as some have argued, the result of his ineffectiveness as a policy-maker, &#8220;hawkish&#8221; attitudes or declining mental health. His collapse, furthermore, was not the natural conclusion of any paranoid delusions or obsessive nature, but rather a result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication to his work at the expense of his own health. This thesis undertakes a content analysis of Forrestal&#8217;s writings and an examination of his policy-making approach, concentrating on the evolution and execution of his policy advice and initiatives, as well as the structure of his authority as secretary of defence. It begins with a biographical overview of his life and public service career, as well as an assessment of existing Cold War scholarship and its general tendency to underestimate Forrestal&#8217;s significance. The components of his legacy are then analysed thematically, with chapters devoted to his foreign policy influence, his role in the unification controversy and his administrative efforts as defence secretary. Throughout, Forrestal&#8217;s career and significance is reassessed both in the application of new theoretical and methodological insights, and the analysis of recently declassified and reorganised documents, particularly the complete and unexpurgated version of Forrestal&#8217;s official diaries.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">james forrestal, cold war, policy-making, defence policy, defence administration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Life and Times of Alex Doucas: Migrant and Author: Searching for a new identity</field><field name="creator">Abraham Sophocleous</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis offers the first detailed critical account of the Greek-Australian writer, Alex Doucas (1900-1962) who came to Australia in 1927 as a migrant from Asia Minor. It attempts to place his work in the perspectives of Greek and Australian literatures and to evaluate his position both as a migrant and as a writer. The Asia Minor Catastrophe and the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923, as well as the Great Depression he faced in Australia along with many other Australians had a profound effect on his social outlook. Considered one of the pioneers of Greek-Australian Literature, Doucas played an important role in the development of Greek community life in Australia during the pre- and post-World War II periods. His work consists of two published novels (one posthumously) and a significant body of published and unpublished, stories, poems, translations and essays. Out of print for some decades, it remains largely unknown to the general public or even to academic circles in Greece and in Australia. It was, however, a landmark of Greek-Australian Literature and continues to have more than historical interest in its treatment of migration, exile and displacement, and in its use of intercultural perspectives to forge a positive vision for humanity. Although forced into ill-paid manual labour for much of his life after his arrival in Australia, Alex Doucas tried to develop links and relationships with Australian intellectual circles and to become involved in Australian life in the broadest way. At the same time, he never lost contact with social, political and literary developments in Greece. Alex Doucas maintained close relations with both the Greek and Australian literary traditions. As a writer he belongs to the Greek generation of the 1930s and its literary traditions. In his work, he dealt with events which took place in Anatolia before the Asia Minor Catastrophe as well as with the impact the catastrophe had on Greek society. He is one of the first writers of his generation who turned his attention to the &#8220;other side of the coin&#8221; and investigated the impact of the Catastrophe on the Turkish people. This perspective was adopted mainly due to the openness that he found in Australia, an openness that led to Multiculturalism. Alex Doucas was a multiculturalist before his time. His work is a fine example of the Australian version of Multiculturalism. Through his brother Stratis Doucas (also a writer) and others, he kept himself informed on all sorts of changes and developments in his native country, Greece, especially as it was shaped after the Asia Minor Catastrophe. At the same time, he tried to understand the Australian way of life, its culture and its literary traditions. His bi-cultural position gave him a powerful perspective. He attempted to understand the Australian way of life through his Greekness and to find answers for problematic events that happened in Greece through his Australian experience. Across the entire span of Doucas&#8217;s work, it is clear that his political philosophy and his belief in the goals of socialism played a crucial role in his consciousness of himself as a writer whose role was to provide the artistic equivalent of the philosophical basis of Marxism, best expressed in the Theses on Feuerbach (1845) by Marx, in his famous dictum, "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it". In other words, it was never enough for Doucas simply to describe in social realist terms the conditions of life and the aspirations of human beings. His aim was to show how these conditions might be changed for the better, not only for the individual, but for the community as a whole. Equally, he wished to show how people&#8217;s aspirations, particularly those of an immigrant community familiar with exile, suffering and loss, might be more fully realised.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural literature, migrant literature, comparative literature, social realism, asia minor catastrophe, modern greek literature, australian literature, literary traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and characterisation of new silicon materials /</field><field name="creator">Folland, Peter David</field><field name="description">Thesis (MAppSc)--University of South Australia, 1997</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elastomers.</field><field name="subject">Silicones.</field><field name="subject">Siloxanes.</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au:8081/1959.8/83241</field><field name="identifier">http://arrow.unisa.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unisa:42633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"We will do it our own ways": a perspective of Southern Sudanese refugees resettlement experiences in Australian society.</field><field name="creator">Lejukole, James Wani-Kana Lino</field><field name="description">The main purpose of my thesis is to understand, from the perspectives of Southern Sudanese themselves, their resettlement experiences in Australia, to provide knowledge about how their experiences of exile reshape their thinking of home, place, identity, gender roles, and traditional practices, to explore the extent of their resettlement and integration into Australian society, and to inform policy on the resettlement of refugees and the settlement services offered to them. The thesis explores the range of interactions and relationships among Southern Sudanese and between them and their Australian hosts. It demonstrates how these interactions and relationships shaped and reshaped the Southern Sudanese sense of identity and belonging in resettlement in Australia. The thesis also provides insights into the relationships between the war that forced them out of their homeland, their flight, life in refugee camp or in exile, and how these affected their ability to resettle. To understand these, I have listened to how they described their lives before and during the war, while seeking refuge, and of their present and future life in Australia. From this I will show how they reproduce and maintain some aspects of their culture within the context of the Australian society, as well as how they are adapting to some aspects of life in that society. In this thesis I also explore the concepts of place, home and identity. In order to understand these concepts and how fluid they are in the current transnational era, I follow Thomas Faist&#8217;s (2000) thinking about the causes, nature and the extent of movement of international migrants from poorer to richer countries (also Cohen 1997; Kaplan 1995; Appadurai 1995). Faist in particular examines the process of adaptation of newcomers to host countries and the reasons why many migrants continue to keep ties to their home or place of origin. These ties, according to Faist, link transnational social spaces which range from border-crossing families and individuals to refugee diaspora. In this, I argue that resettlement involves complex interactions between newly arrived Southern Sudanese and members of Australian society. These complex interactions include firstly an array of social interactions occurring between Southern Sudanese and the staff of support organisations delivering settlement services to them. I show how the Southern Sudanese perceived the services they receive vis-&#224;-vis the staff&#8217;s perceptions of Southern Sudanese as recipients of their services. Secondly they include various kinds of social interactions, relationships and networks among the Southern Sudanese and between them and members of Australian society through making friendships, home visitations, joining social and cultural clubs, and becoming involved in professional associations and churches which are predominantly Australian. I show how these social relations and networking are being enacted and maintained and/or fall apart over time. I ascertain whether these relationships have enhanced their resettlement or not. Thirdly, the thesis shows the impact of a shift in gendered roles and intergenerational conflicts between parents and children on family relationships and how these in turn affect their actual settlement. This thesis is based on these themes and on the analysis drawn from detailed qualitative ethnographic research which I conducted over a period of fourteen months between January 2006 and March 2007 and from the literature. In keeping with the traditions of ethnographic fieldwork practices, I carried out structured and unstructured in-depth interviews and Participant Observation of informants during the fieldwork. The subjects of this thesis are the Southern Sudanese refugees who resettled in South Australia and some staff of organisations which delivered settlement services to them. The fundamental questions which these ethnographic explorations attempt to answer are how do the Southern Sudanese experience resettlement in Australian, interact with members of their host society, construct their identities in relation to their notions of home and place, and negotiate shifting gender roles and relationships in the family. I show how their previous life experiences in Southern Sudan, their plight, their flight from war, their life in refugee camps and/or in refugee settings in other countries, their personal socio-economic and historical backgrounds, have affected their resettlement in Australia. I also explore their current and ongoing relations with their homeland and other Southern Sudanese diaspora and show how this perpetuates their identity as Southern Sudanese. I argue that success or failure in resettlement hinges mostly on the Southern Sudanese ability or inability to understand and speak the English language, their access to employment and stable housing, relationships with Australians, and the quality and quantity of settlement services which they access and receive. I assert that the interplay between/among these factors have combined to influence significantly the settlement processes and the extent of integration of Southern Sudanese into Australian society. Furthermore, I assert that these factors are inseparable and need to be examined and explained in relation to one another as they tend to be interwoven into the daily life experiences of Southern Sudanese.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">resettlement; integration; society; identity; home; place; settlement services; experiences; social network; social interaction; support; gender roles</field><field name="subject">Sudanese Australia Social life and customs.</field><field name="subject">Refugees Australia.</field><field name="subject">Sudan Emigration and immigration.</field><field name="subject">Australia Emigration and immigration.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fast-food consumption: application and extension of the theory of planned behaviour to incorporate affective responses and implicit associations.</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Kirsten</field><field name="description">The consumption of energy-dense fast foods has been implicated as a causal factor in the development of obesity. The development of strategies to modify food choice behaviour requires an understanding of both the behaviour and the influencing factors (in particular, beliefs, attitudes, and social influences). The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB; Ajzen, 1988) is one of the most widely used and accepted models of the intention-behaviour relationship within the health literature (Bagozzi, Wong, Abe, &amp; Bergami, 2000; Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998; Sheppard, Hartwick, &amp; Warshaw, 1988; Sutton, 1998). This thesis spans three studies, applying and extending the TPB to examine factors influencing fast-food consumption in an Australian population. The first study is a qualitative analysis examining components of the belief stage of the TPB, including behavioural outcome, normative, and control beliefs in relation to frequent fast-food consumption. Aside from details of these beliefs, which were used to develop a quantitative measure for application in the second study, the key outcomes of this study were a definition of fast food which was applied throughout each of the studies, clarification of how fast food fits within Australian lifestyles, and generation of additional information regarding other possible influences on fast-food consumption beyond those addressed by the TPB. The additional variables included for examination were affective responses to fast food, individual differences in sensitivity to reward, and the extent to which both consideration of the future consequences of frequent fast-food consumption and fear of being negatively evaluated are influential on consumption rates. The second, quantitative study applied both the TPB-based instrument developed from findings of the first study as well as the four additional measures with the aim of improving the explanatory ability of the TPB in terms of fast-food consumption. Structural equation modelling was used and although the model performed well overall, explaining up to 50% of the variance in both intention and behaviour, there were some variables that did not perform strongly. In particular, the measure of affective responses captured with a semantic differential scale was not significantly predictive, and the third study was designed and conducted to test the performance of a more sophisticated measure in the hope that implicit, in addition to explicit, responses would provide greater explanatory value. The Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, &amp; Schwartz, 1998; Greenwald, Nosek, &amp; Banaji, 2003) is said to provide some insight into more implicit attitudes by measuring the degree to which an individual associates conceptual categories through response latencies (or timed responses) whilst opportunities for introspection are minimised. Some have also suggested that the IAT may contribute well when it is combined with other measures, particularly in the prediction of behaviour, choice, or judgement (Brunel, Tietje, &amp; Greenwald, 2004). Therefore, the third study combined measures based on the TPB with the IAT to investigate the nature of both implicit and explicit beliefs underlying attitudes towards fast foods. Overall, the associations captured by the IAT did not help to explain a great deal of variance in fast-food consumption, although there were differences in associations according to stimulus type with arousal-related stimuli generating stronger results than valence-related stimuli. Differences in associations with fast food were also found across groups divided according to Body Mass Index, with overweight people demonstrating more positive associations than either normal weight or obese people. A summary discusses the potential application of the findings in the development and implementation of future intervention and obesity prevention strategies as well as directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theory of planned behaviour; fast-food; Implicit Associations Test; beliefs; attitudes; affect; food choice</field><field name="subject">Health behavior.</field><field name="subject">Social psychology.</field><field name="subject">Convenience foods.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-incompatibility of olive.</field><field name="creator">Seifi, Esmaeil</field><field name="description">The olive (Olea europaea L.) is one of the most ancient fruit trees and has been cultivated for its oil in the Mediterranean area for thousands of years. Today, the consumption of olive oil and table olives is increasing both in traditional producing countries and the entire world. Most olive cultivars are self-incompatible and do not produce a commercial yield after self pollination. In this thesis, inflorescence architecture and sexual compatibility relationships of some olive cultivars, and gene expression in olive pistils during flowering were studied. To study the inflorescence architecture of olive, 45 inflorescences in each of the cultivars Manzanillo, Mission, and Frantoio were checked every morning from flower opening to petal fall. The flower position on the inflorescence had a highly significant effect on the opening day in all cultivars. Terminal flowers and the flowers located on the primary branches opened earlier than flowers located on the secondary branches. Flower position also had a highly significant effect on gender in Manzanillo and Mission. In Manzanillo, the secondary branches had fewer perfect flowers than the primary branches. In Mission, the secondary branches had no perfect flowers at all. In Manzanillo, perfect flowers had significantly longer petal persistence than staminate flowers. To study flower competition within the inflorescence, the distal halves, on which the flowers tend to be perfect, of 120 inflorescences in three trees of Manzanillo were removed about one month before full bloom. This resulted in a highly significant increase in the percentage of perfect flowers on the proximal halves. The effects of shoot orientation and inflorescence location on inflorescence characteristics in the cultivars Frantoio, Kalamata, and Koroneiki were also studied. For each cultivar, inflorescence characteristics in three sections of shoots (top, middle, and base) and four sides of the three selected trees (north, south, east, and west) were recorded. The statistical analysis showed that basal inflorescences were shorter and with fewer flowers but with the same percentage of perfect flowers. Shoot orientation did not have any influence on these characteristics in any of the cultivars. Sexual compatibility was assessed using two methods. In the first method, controlled crossings were performed in the cultivars Frantoio, Koroneiki, and Kalamata. The pistils were harvested one week after hand pollination and stained with 0.1% aniline blue. The styles and ovules were separated, mounted in 80% glycerol, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. In Frantoio and Koroneiki, the number of ovules penetrated by a pollen tube was used to estimate the level of sexual compatibility. In Kalamata, the numbers of ovules penetrated by pollen tubes were not significantly different between treatments; therefore, the number of pollen tubes in the lower style was used. All the cultivars studied were self- incompatible. Frantoio (as a host) was incompatible with Koroneiki and Barnea but partially compatible with Mission. Koroneiki (as a host) was incompatible with Barnea but partially compatible with Frantoio and Mission. Kalamata (as a host) was compatible with Barnea, incompatible with Mission and Koroneiki in 2004, but partially compatible with them in 2005. In the second method, eight microsatellite markers were used for genotyping three Kalamata mother trees, 40 embryos per mother tree, and all the potential pollen donors. Genotyping data were analysed using FaMoz software, and the number of embryos assigned to each putative pollen donor was determined. Paternity analysis showed that Kalamata (as a host) was self-incompatible, compatible with Barnea, Benito, and Katsourela, but incompatible with Arbequina, Azapa, and Picual. To study the gene expression in olive pistils during flowering, a genomic approach was initiated using cDNA subtractive array analysis. Total RNA was isolated from olive pistils at two developmental stages, where self-incompatibility (SI) genes are expected to be differentially expressed: 1) small green flower buds (expression of SI genes not expected) and 2) large white flower buds containing receptive pistils just prior to opening (expression of SI genes expected). From each stage, cDNA libraries were prepared and put through forward and reverse subtractive hybridisations to enrich for differentially expressed cDNAs in stage 2. Macroarrays were prepared by printing 2304 differentially expressed cDNAs onto nylon membranes and hybridised with forwardand reverse-subtracted probes. The analysis identified 90 up-regulated cDNA clones highly expressed in receptive pistils. Further subtracted and unsubtracted hybridisations confirmed up-regulation of the majority of these cDNAs. Gene expression profiles across different tissues showed that most of the genes were pistil-specific. The expression pattern of the genes showed high similarity in Kalamata, Frantoio, Barnea, and Pendolino. All the screened genes were sequenced and their similarities were searched in the NCBI database. The most redundant and interesting up-regulated clones were those similar to a receptor protein kinase-like protein. Some versions of this protein play a role in the sporophytic SI system of Brassica and the gametophytic SI system of Papaver and rye.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">olive; self-incompatibility; pollination; inflorescence architecture; paternity analysis; gene expression; pollen tube observation</field><field name="subject">Olive</field><field name="subject">Plant breeding Genetic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing overabundant and mobile wildlife: social and institutional dimensions of kangaroo harvest in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Thomsen, Dana Arlene</field><field name="description">In South Australia, overabundant kangaroo populations are managed through commercial harvest. Kangaroo harvest rates over the past decade have averaged only 40% of the harvest quota despite strong demand for the product. With kangaroo populations increasing, the problem of low kangaroo harvest rate in South Australia requires research attention. Previous research regarding kangaroo harvest has focused on questions of biology and ecology and little attention has been directed towards advancing understanding of the human dimensions of kangaroo management. This research sought to fill this gap in knowledge. Qualitative research methods were most appropriate due to the focus on social and institutional dimensions of kangaroo management. Data were collected during interviews with people involved in commercial kangaroo harvest: landholders, harvesters and meat processors. The main topics covered were regnlations and policy, economic issues, the rights and interests of various industry stakeholders and South Australian harvest rates. The views of Aboriginal people were also sought including the significance of kangaroos to Aboriginal people, access to kangaroos for subsistence harvest, kangaroo management and the kangaroo industry. The main findings of this research are presented as a series of peer-reviewed articles: &#8226; Article I introduces the research topic and presents preliminary findings of this study. &#8226; Article 2 establishes that an increase in South Australia's low harvest rate is needed if kangaroo harvest is to make greater contributions to regional communities, and recommends institutional reform to meet this goal. &#8226; Article 3 examines the management regime for kangaroos in South Australia and shows how the informal rules in use are often incongruent with the formal rules established by management administrators. &#8226; Article 4 describes the undervalued position of landholders in the kangaroo industry and the obstacles to landholders deriving income from kangaroo harvest. &#8226; Article 5 discusses the cultural basis of Aboriginal perspectives on kangaroo harvest and includes suggestions for appropriate ways for Aboriginal people to contribute to kangaroo management. The main findings of this research were applied in a comparative study of kangaroo management with that of moose management in Finland. This study found that similar social and institutional factors impact on the management of moose and kangaroos. The broad lessons for wildlife management drawn from the comparative study are: &#8226; mobile wildlife resources require flexible management systems &#8226; stakeholder involvement is critical to management &#8226; hunters/harvesters are conservative of their resource base &#8226; declining harvester numbers need to be addressed through support, incentives and training. These lessons can be applied in part, or in whole, to other overabundant and mobile wildlife species. Thus this thesis makes contribution to kangaroo management by making specific recommendations for the industry, but also contributes to wildlife management in a broader sense through the application of findings to other species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kangaroo harvest; overabundant; mobile; wildlife; management; social; institutional</field><field name="subject">Kangaroos Control South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Kangaroos Management South Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians Social life and customs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The characterizations of spontaneous and vaccine-driven antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in melanoma patients.</field><field name="creator">Smith, Caroline L</field><field name="description">Title page, table of contents and abstract only.

The pressure response is theoretically a function of the condition of the pipeline wall (which is the fundamental characteristic related to the propagation of a transient wavefront) and reflections and damping from any fault that may be present. If an accurate transient model of the pipeline under examination can be developed then it may then be possible to isolate particular parameters in it (relating to the wall thickness of the pipeline or faults such as blockages, air pockets and leaks) and fit these to give optimal matches between the model predicted and measured response of the pipeline. This process is often referred to as inverse analysis (and hence the derivation of the name Inverse Transient Analysis). While a significant amount of numerical and laboratory investigation has been carried out focussing on the use of ITA for leak detection, few field studies have been undertaken. The goal of this research is to determine whether transient response analysis and Inverse Transient Analysis (ITA) can be applied in field situations to provide useful information regarding the condition of pipeline walls and the presence of specific faults such as blockages, air pockets and leaks. Numerous field tests are conducted on large scale transmission pipelines, small scale distribution pipelines and a distribution network in order to obtain a view of the nature of the measured transient responses at each scale and to identify any common characteristics. The capacity of existing transient models to replicate the measured responses is then assessed and they are found to be generally incapable of replicating the field data. Given the physical complexity of field pipelines, and a number of complex phenomena that have been traditionally neglected, this result is not unexpected. The research proposes the development of transient models that can be calibrated to measured responses. These models incorporate mechanisms for including mechanical dispersion and damping and follow precedents developed in other fields of engineering in which damping of transient phenomena is significant.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transients; waterhammer; analysis; field; measurements; modelling; pipes; networks; faults; condition assessment; wall thickness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of physiological traits and identification of QTLs for drought tolerance in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).</field><field name="creator">Izanloo, Ali</field><field name="description">This study comprised three major parts: a comparative physiological study of drought responses under controlled conditions; a genetic study to construct the skeleton map of a doubled haploid (DH) population; and a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to identify QTLs associated with drought tolerance traits in the field. In the first part (Chapter 3), three cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) adapted to South Australian conditions were tested for drought tolerance under cyclic drought in growth rooms and glasshouse. Extensive physiological traits, including stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, ABA content, water status traits (e.g. osmotic adjustment, RWC and leaf water potential), water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and carbon isotope discrimination (&#916;&#185; &#179;C) were measured during experiments. Through these experiments, the drought responses of the three cultivars were physiologically dissected and the likely processes contributing most to drought tolerance were identified. In the South Australian wheatbelt, cyclic drought is a frequent event, represented by intermittent periods of rainfall which can occur around anthesis and post-anthesis in wheat. Three South Australian bread wheat cultivars, Excalibur, Kukri and RAC875, were evaluated in two growth room experiments under cyclic water-limiting conditions. In the first experiment, where plants were subjected to severe water stress, RAC875 and Excalibur (drought tolerant) showed significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher grain yield under cyclic water availability compared to Kukri (drought susceptible), producing 44% and 18% more grain yield compared to Kukri, respectively. In the second growth room experiment, where plants were subjected to a milder drought stress, the differences between cultivars were less pronounced, with only RAC875 showing significantly higher grain yield under the cyclic water treatment. Grain number per spike and the percentage of aborted tillers were the major yield components that affected yield under cyclic water stress. Excalibur and RAC875 adopted different morpho-physiological traits and mechanisms to reduce water stress. Excalibur was most responsive to cyclic water availability and showed the highest level of osmotic adjustment (OA), highest stomatal conductance, lowest ABA content and most rapid recovery from stress under cyclic water stress. RAC875 was more &#8216;conservative&#8217; in its responses, with moderate OA, high leaf waxiness, high chlorophyll content and slower recovery from stress. Within this germplasm, the capacity for osmotic adjustment was the main physiological attribute associated with tolerance under cyclic water stress, which enabled plants to recover from water deficit. In the second part (Chapter 4), the genetic linkage map of a DH population including 368 lines, which was developed from a cross between &#8216;RAC875&#8217; and &#8216;Kukri&#8217;, was constructed. The genetic linkage map consisted of about 500 molecular markers including ~300 DArT (Diversity array technology) and ~200 SSR (Microsattelite markers). In the third part (Chapter 5), Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) linked to plant phenology and production traits under irrigated and drought stress conditions were mapped by means of a DH population. To phenotype the population, 368 DH lines were cultivated in two replicates in five environments (three sites across South Australian wheatbelt in collaboration with Australian Grain Technology (AGT) in 2006, and two trials in Mexico in collaboration with CYMMIT, 2007). Data of grain yield, yield components, maturity related traits and some morpho-physiological traits such as leaf chlorophyll content, leaf waxiness, plant height, peduncle length, flag leaf and spike length were measured. Raw data were then analysed for spatial variation for each single trial using the REML procedure in GenStat (version 6). The DH lines showed significant variation for plant phenology, grain yield and yield components under irrigated and drought stress conditions. QTL analyses were performed using QTLCartographer and QTLNetwork for each trait in each site. Two major QTL for maturity traits were identified on chromosomes 2BS and 2DS corresponding to Ppd-B1 and Ppd-D1, respectively. A region was identified on chromosome 7A that harbored major QTL for grain yield, number of grains per square meter, number of grain per spike and spike fertility under drought stress. For yield data in the irrigated trial, two major QTL were identified on chromosome 3B which were not detected in drought stress environments. By using different datasets in the QTL analysis (splitting the population into two subpopulation based on heading time and also adjusting the phenotypic data for heading time to eliminate heading time effect), a QTL for grain yield was consistently detected on chromosome 7A in drought-affected environments. The coincidence of a drought response index QTL on this chromosome indicated that it might be a QTL for yield response under drought. This study demonstrated that the region on the long arm of chromosome 7A identified for grain yield and yield components is a drought response QTL which is closely linked to, but separate from, a heading time QTL. This QTL cluster on chromosome 7A could be used as a good target for positional cloning and gene isolation. However further work would be required to confirm and validate the identified QTLs in this preliminary QTL analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drought; wheat; linkage map; quantitative trait loci (QTL)</field><field name="subject">Wheat Genetics.</field><field name="subject">Wheat Growth.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58242</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental analysis of navigation and homing in fluid environments</field><field name="creator">Marcotte, Megan M.</field><field name="description">Whole document restricted until May 2014, see Access Instructions file below for details of how to access the print copy.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride Emissions from Aluminium Electrolysis Cells</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Edwin Campbell</field><field name="description">Modern aluminium electrolysis cells generate between 15 to 40 kg fluoride per tonne of aluminium fluoride produced. This represent a large material recycle load, of which over 99% of this fluoride content is returned to the cell via a dry scrubbing system. Most past research has concentrated on increasing the efficiency of this end scrubbing system, neglecting the actual cause of the fluoride emissions. Lower emissions would reduce this loading, resulting in smaller scrubbing systems, and ultimately lower capital costs. Fluoride emissions also contribute to the changes in heat balance in the cell. The fluoride evolved represents a material loss that requires to be replaced with AlF3. The addition of this species is a major variable in cell heat balance instability [1]. Overall a better understanding of the contributors to fluoride generation in an aluminium cell would benefit the operation and economics of an aluminium smelter. Past studies [2-6] have identified most of the important emission contributors to hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation. Two sources were shown to be significant. The most studied source was primary HF generation. This is HF generation from electrolytic reactions between constituents of the fluoride based electrolyte and water from the fed alumina and hydrogen in the anode. Overlooked in some studies were generation reactions outside the electrolyte - defined in this study as secondary HF generation. This source was found to occur mainly from hydrolysis reactions with the generated particulate fluorides. However the results and the relative contributions from these studies are not strictly applicable to the current generation scenario. The present smelting practices and technology, dry scrubbing technology and raw material specifications differ substantially from those used during the period of each past investigation. The present study was designed to identify and quantify emission sources for the current smelter technology and practices. This used controlled laboratory based studies of the individual generation sources complemented by in plant studies analysing the HF emission from production aluminium electrolysis cells. It was shown that the main contributor to primary HF generation is the addition of water to the electrolyte from the feed alumina. This results in the cyclic short term variations in HF emission, which correlate to the rate of alumina addition to the cell. Laboratory and industrial studies show that only a fraction of the added water reacts. The water reacted is likely the structural water of the alumina. The adsorbed water is thought to be flashed off before addition to the bath. Depending on feeding technology and crust integrity, between 10 to 50% of this water can react. This produces 7 to 14 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the most significant emission component. The remainder of this structural water is either entrained in the anode gases or forms part of the electrolyte dissolved water content. Dissolved water generation is the second most significant primary generation contributor, and third most significant emission component. Dissolved water is in equilibrium with the alumina content of the bath. It represents a constant emission source. Depending on feeding technology and cell design, the emission can vary between 3 to 10 kgF/tonneAl. The final primary HF emission contributor results from electrolytic generation of the hydrogen content of the anode. Laboratory studies found the emission to have a reaction efficiency of approximately 10%. This results in a small emission, of 2 &#8211; 5 kg/tonneAl. The remainder of the hydrogen content is expected to be entrained in the anode gases, as the generation of this CO/CO2 mixture is an order of magnitude greater than the HF generation reaction. Secondary generation of hydrogen fluoride is also a significant HF emission source. In an industrial cell this results from mainly thermal hydrolysis of the particulate fluoride emissions at the crust&#8211;air interface. Laboratory studies have shown that other identified secondary emission sources are unlikely due to the ambient conditions and feeding practices in a modern prebake aluminium electrolysis cell. Hence previously proposed generation from hydrolysis of the particulates in the ducts and desorption of the surface fluoride from the fed secondary alumina, have been found to be insignificant compared to the main HF generation sources. The thermal hydrolysis emission contributor is the only significant secondary generation emission component. Industrial measurements show that it varies with ambient humidity and crust integrity, two parameters which vary constantly in a modern prebake anode cell. Measurements show that the emission from this source is responsible for 2 to 8 kgF/tonneAl. This makes it the second highest HF emission component. Control of the crust condition and feeder hole states reduces this component significantly. Hence in a modern prebake aluminium cell, the most significant operational factors affecting emission are related mainly to secondary generation. Industrial measurements show that the long term variations in an emission result from changes in the ambient humidity and the cells crust cover. Control of the crust integrity is thus paramount in reducing such variations. This relates both to normal operation and batch operations. Reduction of all other sources of emission are a material composition problem. Simply reducing the water content (LOI(300) and LOI(1000)) and reducing the hydrogen content of the anodes will reduce the emission. However material considerations affect other aspects of cell operation and hence these factors are not as simple to adjust.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of underground flow processes in hydrothermal eruptions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Thomasin Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on a study of underground fluid flow and boiling processes which take place in hydrothermal eruptions. A conceptual model is presented for the eruptive process and a laboratory scale physical model confirming the effectiveness of this process is described. A mathematical formulation of the underground flow problem is given for two fluid flow regimes: two-phase homogeneous mixture (HM) flow and separable two-phase (SP) flow. Solutions to the system of equations obtained are solved under the simplifying assumptions of two-dimensional steady isothermal flow and transient non-isothermal horizontal flow. The main contribution of the study on steady isothermal flows is a description of how the ground flow may recover following a hydrothermal eruption. A numerical technique developed for plotting the streamlines in this case (and verified against analytic results) may also have applications in solving the steady non-isothermal flow problem. The main contribution of the study on the transient horizontal flow problem is a comparison of the differing predictions of HM and SP flow.

Unsuckled newborn piglets were fed from a bottle with colostrum or milk from either sows or cows, infant formula, or water. After 24 hours intestinal development was compared with that in piglets at birth and others naturally suckled. Sow colostrum caused greater increases in weight and length of the small intestine than did any of the other diets. The increases were due to mucosal cell swelling caused by cellular protein accumulation, hyperplasia and, in the duodenum, hypertrophy. Feeding sow colostrum increased mucosal lactase activity. Cow colostrum caused decreases in mucosal RNA levels. Increases in the DNA content of the intestinal mucosa occurred in all groups, including the water fed group. Colostrum feeding also enhanced pancreatic growth and feeding infant formula increased liver weight. 2. The effects of enteral feeding on small intestinal development were investigated by feeding nutrient solution to unsuckled newborn piglets by orogastric tube or parenterally. Both groups after 24 hours had greater intestinal development than did the piglets at birth. The development was most pronounced in the duodenum and lower ileum. Apart from a greater small intestinal length in the orogastrically fed piglets there were no significant differences between the orogastrically and parenterally fed groups. 3. To investigate the effects of sucking per se on small intestinal development, groups of unsuckled piglets were fed for 24 hours with either sow colostrum or infant formula by orogastric tube or being allowed to suck from a bottle. Sucking did not affect intestinal development whereas colostrum, regardless of how it was fed, had significantly greater effects on intestinal development than did infant formula. For the colostrum fed piglets the intestinal length, tissue weight, circumference, wall thickness, villous height and width, RNA content, protein:DNA ratio and RNA:DNA ratio were all significantly greater than for those fed infant formula. In the duodenum the estimated cell migration rate was faster and mucosal cell replacement time was shorter than in other parts of the small intestine, regardless of the diet fed. The greater villous height in the piglets fed sow colostrum was most likely due to the combined effects of cellular swelling and an increase in the number of villous cells. These results indicate that (a) sow colostrum causes cellular swelling related to colostral protein accumulation, cell hyperplasia and, in the duodenum, hypertrophy, (b) there is a basal rate of mucosal cell division which contributes to mucosal growth regardless of diet and method of feeding, (c) the duodenum exhibits a greater growth and sensitivity to the trophic effects of colostrum compared to other parts of the small intestine, (d) feeding cow colostrum to newborn piglets causes a pronounced decrease in mucosal RNA content and (e) diets affect postnatal development of the small intestine whereas the route or method of feeding has no significant effects on small intestinal development in piglets during the first 24 hours after birth.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Swine</field><field name="subject">Swine nutrition</field><field name="subject">Swine anatomy</field><field name="subject">Swine feed utilization efficiency</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270603 Animal physiology-systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A burning question? : fire, livelihoods and sustainability in the Navosa region of the Fiji Islands : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">King, Trevor George</field><field name="description">The relevance of the sustainable development approach for land conservation in tropical hill regions is often assumed, but is seldom evaluated against local realities. This study analyses the causes of land degradation and unsustainability in the seasonally fire-prone region of Navosa, Viti Levu, Fiji Islands. A complex and multi-layered set of connections exists between livelihood strategies and the environment in this region where fire is used as a tool. Traditional institutions governing land management have been undermined, however, and the sustainability of the vanua (or land-people nexus) is threatened. Despite their reliance on fire, local participants reported uncontrolled burning (caused by a minority of villagers) and deforestation leading to land degradation, lower productivity and damage to fisheries. Degradation was increasing parallel with escalating human and animal populations, despite relatively equitable, resilient and livelihood-enhancing cultural institutions. Non-indigenous models of resource use, imposed by colonial and neocolonial authorities, have exacerbated land degradation and compromised indigenous resource management. Traditional tenure and leadership are impeded, leading to inequities in access to land as populations increase, and leaving local leaders unable to enact conservation. An intrusive market-based economic system encourages increased resource exploitation with little regard for environmental sustainability. A traditional model of agroarboriculture and indigenous development in the form of still-observable (but largely disused) irrigated terraces suggests the relevance of a sustainable alternative based on indigenous knowledge. To achieve sustainable development in Navosa, the emphasis should be on socio-environmental amelioration rather than on economic development (which exacerbates degradation), and to this end, local participants expressed a desire for particular conservation strategies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Fiji</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology::370302 Social and cultural anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cloning, characterisation and evolutionary relationships of two pyr4 genes from an Acremonium endophyte of perennial ryegrass : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Collett, Michael Anthony</field><field name="description">A fragment of the Claviceps purpurea pyr4 gene, encoding the enzyme orotidine-5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPdecarboxylase) was used to screen a genomic library to an isolate (designated Lp1) of an Acremonium sp. which grows as an endophyte in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). Four positive clones, &#955;MC11, &#955;MC12, &#955;MC14 and &#955;MC20 were isolated. Three of these clones, &#955;MC12, &#955;MC14 and &#955;MC20 were overlapping clones from the same locus, while &#955;MC11 was from a different locus. Fragments of these clones which hybridised with C. purpurea pyr4 were sequenced and found to have similarity with pyr4 from other fungi of the Pyrenomycetes and related Deuteromycetes, suggesting that Lp1 has evolved from a sexual Pyrenomycetes species. The pyr4 from &#955;MC12, &#955;MC14 and &#955;MC20 was designated pyr4-1 and that from &#955;MC11 was designated pyr4-2. The predicted ORFs of the two genes were highly conserved and the 5' non-coding nucleotide sequences were the least conserved regions. RT-PCR and northern analysis of total RNA from Lp1 demonstrated that transcripts approximately 1.4 kb in length were produced from the two genes and present at similar levels. Genomic fragments containing pyr4-1 or pyr4-2 were transformed into a strain of Aspergillus nidulans which has a mutation in the pyrG gene (encoding OMPdecarboxylase). Both of the Lp1 pyr4 complemented a pyrG mutation in Aspergillus nidulans, confirming that both pyr4-1 and pyr4-2 encode functional OMPdecarboxylases. Comparisons of pyr4 restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) from Lp1 and isolates of Epichlo&#235; typhina, E. festucae, A. lolii, A. uncinatum, and three endophyte taxonomic groupings from Festuca arundinacea: FaTG-1 (=A. coenophialum), FaTG-2 and FaTG-3 suggested that pyr4-1 originated from E. typhina, the ryegrass choke pathogen, and pyr4-2 originated from A. lolii, another endophyte from perennial ryegrass. This suggested that Lp1 is an interspecific hybrid, between E. typhina and A. lolii. Comparisons of the variable 5' non-coding nucleotide sequences from pyr4 of Lp1 and other isolates demonstrated that E. typhina, and A. lolii or E. festucae were the most likely ancestors of the two pyr4 found in Lp1. The A. lolii and E. festucae sequences were very similar, suggesting they are closely related. A. lolii has most probably evolved from an E. festucae, and in the process lost the sexual cycle. Analysis of single spore purified isolates of Lp1 revealed that Lp1 was a homokaryon for pyr4. A Southern blot of a CHEF gel of Lp1 and these single spored isolates was hybridised to a pyr4 probe and demonstrated that pyr4-1 and pyr4-2 were present on either two chromosomes of similar size, or one chromosome. The hybridisation that gave rise to Lp1 was concluded to have been a relatively recent event, given the similarity of pyr4-1 and pyr4-2 nucleotide sequences to those of their probable ancestors, and the fact that both genes are expressed and functional. Interspecific hybridisation is probably widespread in the asexual endophytes, and may be an important event in their evolution, and the evolution of other fungal species.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acremonium</field><field name="subject">Ryegrasses</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270203 Population and ecological genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring quality in a university : a critical systems approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Educational Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Houston, Donald James</field><field name="description">Since the 1990s quality management has been translocated from industry into higher education. However, there is little evidence that improvement in the core functions of universities has resulted. This study adopts a critical systems approach that is grounded in a critique of prevailing models of quality management to explore quality in a university. It examines the potential of Critical Systems Thinking enacted through Total Systems Intervention (TSI) to promote improvement. A case is made for local intervention towards improvement. The thesis is structured around the three modes of TSI, namely Critical Review, Problem Solving and Critical Reflection. A Critical Review of Quality Management suggests that the opposition of academics to quality initiatives in general, and to Quality Management in particular, is rooted in its language and underlying image of organization. This proposition is explored through an analysis of key Quality Management definitions and concepts in relation to the university. The importance of language, metaphors and images of organization are explored. The fitness for purpose of industrial models of quality for universities is challenged. TSI is employed in its Problem Solving mode to describe the quality problem for an academic unit within a university in New Zealand initially from the perspective of its staff and students. For them, the quality problem mainly related to better promoting learning. Analysis and reflection on the problem and context drawing on systems methodologies shaped interventions for improvement. Critical Reflection on a cycle of participative creativity, choice and implementation identified cultural, structural and environmental factors that present threats not only to quality improvement but also to the viability of the unit. The main findings and conclusions question the appropriateness of current models of QM in the university. The thesis demonstrates key systemic problems in higher education; provides a rationale for systemic interventions; identifies pressures that make resistance to systems thinking almost inevitable; and illustrates that TSI is more appropriately used by external researchers than insider researchers. Nevertheless, critical systems approaches, in particular boundary critique, help to structure the problem of improving quality in locally meaningful ways. The challenges of using systems ideas and systems methodologies in the university context, however, are substantial.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Universities and colleges</field><field name="subject">Administration</field><field name="subject">Total quality management TQM</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexible work and disciplined selves : telework, gender and discourses of subjectivity : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Armstrong, Nicola</field><field name="description">Home-based work employing information and communications technologies (telework) is held up in contemporary academic literatures, policy formulations and the popular media as the cure to a panoply of contemporary problems, particularly the difficulties of combining caring responsibilities and careers. This thesis takes up the question of how teleworkers talk about and practise home-based business. It pivots on the exploration of the simultaneity of parenting, partnering and paid work for home-based business people. The 'teleworking tales' of eleven home-based entrepreneurs form the heart of the thesis, as they discuss their negotiation of 'home' and 'work' where the usual temporal and spatial boundaries between these arenas are removed. While previous studies assume that telework is 'family-friendly', most do not investigate the perspectives of other family members on the effect of home-based business on their households and relationships. This thesis speaks into this silence in the literature by contextualising telework within family relations, including as participants the partners, children and child care workers of the eleven home-based businesswomen and men, interviewing thirty people in all. Three strands of analysis regarding discourses of the organisation, domesticity and entrepreneurship were pursued in relation to these 'teleworking tales'. It was found that these 'tales' were told differently by teleworking women and men, the women focusing on the untenable nature of continued organisational employment as women and mothers, while the men established home-based businesses because of declining employment security and redundancy. In the midst of these constituting relations, the discursive injunction to be a 'fit worker' and a 'good parent' had different implications for the women and men; where as the women negotiated home-based entrepreneurship through domesticity, the men navigated their way around domesticity in order to maintain a singular focus on their businesses. The effect of the cross-cutting axes of domesticity and entrepreneurship significantly curtailed the opportunity for teleworking to represent a new crafting of the relationship between 'home' and 'work' as teleworkers negotiated the simultaneous demands their families and businesses made upon them. It was also the case that home-based businesses were a source of pleasure and of productive forms of power which encouraged home-based entrepreneurs to watch over and discipline themselves. The research unfolds as both a warning and a promise with regard to the 'choice' to telework, in terms of what is 'chosen' and how that is 'controlled'. It is particularly a contribution to current debates regarding the complex patterning of gendered and familial practices which continually fragment the freedoms promised by the discourse of entrepreneurship.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Telecommuting</field><field name="subject">Home-based businesses</field><field name="subject">Work and family</field><field name="subject">Sexual division of labour</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Employment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370104 Urban sociology and community studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speckle photography and displacement analysis of large structures : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Production Technology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">North, Heather Claire</field><field name="description">This research demonstrates the feasibility of a full-field photographic method for remotely measuring the movement of large deforming objects. 'Large objects' could include civil engineering structures such as dam walls, buildings and bridges, and geological phenomena such as glaciers. Such structures must be examined in situ and preferably by a non contacting method. The objective is to measure motion from time lapsed photographs of the moving object. The method is based on speckle photography which is a well developed optical metrology technique for deformation measurement of engineering structures in laboratory conditions. Its application to large scale structures illuminated in sunlight at high imaging demagnifications has demanded some significant extensions and modifications to the technique. Imaging these large objects offers a unique set of challenges which include the establishment of rigid tripods from which to take the time lapsed photographs in rugged glacial terrain, the variation of illumination in terms of both quality and angle of incidence, imaging through several kilometres of turbulent atmosphere and recording the signature texture of the object surface onto film at high imaging demagnifications. The effects of these factors are considered both conceptually and experimentally, providing fundamental understanding of the problem. Displacement analysis is performed primarily by interrogation of time lapsed negative pairs using an unexpanded laser beam, as is generally the case in speckle photography. An automated system is developed to make practical the analysis of multiple points in the field of view. In parallel, a new digital technique is introduced where displacement results are obtained by pattern matching in digital versions of the speckle images. This analysis method is shown to be highly suitable for the application to glacier flow. Registration of the pair of time lapsed images is performed by calculating the affine transform describing the image misalignment (introduced at either the recording or analysis stage) within the non-deforming areas of the field of view. Use of this novel technique allows pairs of single exposures, rather than double exposures, to be examined, and it also increases the sensitivity of measurement. Two dimensional motion fields representing glacier flow are presented, leading to the conclusion that the technique is feasible in sunlight illumination, for a variety of glacial surface types and at high imaging demagnifications.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speckle metrology</field><field name="subject">Glaciers</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291400 Materials Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land and lineage : the articulation of social and physical space in an atoll village : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Sociology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">King, Peter Stanton</field><field name="description">This thesis examines relationships between the social and physical environments of a village on Butaritari atoll in Kiribati. The system of ambilineal descent and land inheritance obtaining there results in complex networks of genealogical relationships which affect most aspects of social life, including land rights. While previous studies conducted in Kiribati have recognised the intimate connection between genealogy and land rights, none has investigated its ramifications for the distribution of land rights within a community. In contrast, this study engages that question as a central concern using a framework which integrates Bourdieu's concepts of social space, field and habitus with post-neo-Darwinian ideas about the relationship between organism and environment. The social space was found to be primarily structured by relationships based upon genealogy and secondarily by age and gender, each of which constituted a field within the wider social space. The genealogical field was defined by a network of positions, each representing a particular descent group. In accordance with the prevailing system of ambilineal descent, residents could belong to more than one descent group and it was upon the resulting networks of relationships between descent groups that the disposition of those groups within the genealogical field was defined. Because land-use rights were associated with genealogical connections the reconstruction of the genealogical field encompassing all of the village residents was a necessary precursor to discovering the distribution of those rights and the genealogical field was a central point of articulation between the social and physical spaces. The fields of age and gender relations provided further points of articulation between the social and physical spaces, the natures of which are examined through discussion of the material culture of the village and village and island politics. Despite a contemporary ideology of egalitarianism there were vestiges of a former hierarchy of social status groups. While the inter-group obligations, rights and responsibilities associated with this hierarchy were no longer practised, the association of contemporary residents with those social status groups bore a relationship to their position within the genealogical field and the amounts of land to which they shared rights.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social life and customs</field><field name="subject">Butaritari Atoll</field><field name="subject">Kiribati</field><field name="subject">Kinship</field><field name="subject">Inheritance and succession</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370108 Rural Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trade secrets in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Business Law at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Duncan</field><field name="description">The major problems associated with trade secret law in New Zealand are that it is confused in definition and in jurisdiction. This confusion contributes to the failure of trade secret law in some instances, particularly to protect information created in the emerging biotechnology and computer software industries. This has contributed to alternative forms of protection, notably through copyright for computer programs. From a review of the current law, categories of trade secrets are identified, including sub-patentable and patentable trade secrets. The jurisdictional dispute may be resolved if it is recognised that trade secrets represent a form of property right. To this end, the legal and economic approaches to property rights are synthesised. This synthesis is then extended to create a legal-economic model of the justifications for, and the problems with, the protection of these rights: the intellectual property rights continuum. From this model, it is concluded that some legal protection of trade secrets is justified, provided that equally harmful effects are not created. In particular, sub-patentable trade secrets may warrant greater protection, and patentable trade secrets may be over-protected. One proposal is to punish industrial espionage, although some harmful effects may result. Utility models and laws that protect trade secrets in general are considered and rejected as solutions. Instead, patents of improvement (PI) are proposed which would protect trade secrets that represent an advance on an existing patent. PI would represent a lower standard of inventiveness that is adopted from American biotechnology patent disputes, and so protect sub-patentable trade secrets. The other, higher threshold from the existing English patent law would remain as the patent standard. If a PI were granted to a patent owner, then s/he could practise price discrimination, but if granted to a rival, then competition could result. Either outcome could protect trade secrets, yet mitigate the harmful effects of legal protection. If these proposals were adopted, more information could be produced as well as utilised. Moreover, the growth of the biotechnology and computer software industries in New Zealand could be furthered.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual property</field><field name="subject">Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Trade secrets</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law::390104 Commercial and contract law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mind of a nation : a philosophical and historical critique of psychology in New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Psychology at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Jackson, Peter Anthony</field><field name="description">In this thesis the development of the discipline of academic psychology in New Zealand is explored both as a history and as an intellectual framework. The key tasks of this thesis are outlined, and the problems associated with writing a history are discussed. The methodology is explained as consisting of archival research, surveying and face-to-face interviewing. There follows an examination of the intellectual development of psychology, from the time of the Ancient Greeks to the present day, where the analytical focus is the fundamental dichotomy of mind-body and, as a subset, human consciousness. This focus is important to this thesis because the researcher regards consciousness as the major variable in the evolution of psychology. Chapter three deals more specifically with the mind-body issue and consciousness, and provides an intellectual framework within which the historical developments of psychology on these shores can be considered. Chapter four deals with academic psychology in New Zealand, from its earliest times when Otago University was founded, where it was taught as a subset of philosophy, to the point at which psychology gained autonomy as an independent discipline. This exposition includes the creation and development of the University of New Zealand. In this chapter, it is shown that while psychology was first taught at Otago in 1875, it gained its freedom last of all at that university. Other factors highlighted in this chapter include the involvement of the Presbyterian Church in the development of philosophy (hence psychology) at Otago, and the turbulence of those early years there, where no less than eight professors of philosophy came and went, by comparison with only the one at Victoria College. Chapter five begins at the point at which psychology gained its independence from philosophy, which varied in time across the then four university colleges. The first department to break free was at Victoria College (1950) and the last, Otago (1964). The roles of key personalities are explored, where these are supplemented by extracts from personal interviews. The way in which courses and programmes within each department of psychology developed is also examined. In particular, the output of graduate theses (Doctoral and Masterate) are analysed, across the decades of existence of each department, in terms of subdisciplines and gender. Of interest is the finding of a marked gender reversal effect, which occurred around the late 1970s to the early 1980s, in which theses produced by female graduates outstripped those produced by males. This chapter also reports the findings of a survey of New Zealand psychology academics conducted by the researcher, using a mailed-out questionnaire. The findings include a participant profile and views on a variety of variables such as philosophical stance and theoretical orientation. The final chapter includes comparisons across the six university departments of psychology with attempts at explaining some of the key findings, a brief look at the non-university providers of psychology at the degree level, a consideration of some new directions for academic psychology in this country and, finally, a revisiting of the topic of consciousness which ran as a thread through the thesis.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Higher education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1308</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Street photography in the Google age : written component presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ivory, Andrew John</field><field name="description">The role and position of the documentary street photographer is examined in the context of other forms of contemporary visual survey, including Google Street View.

Comparisons are drawn between the methodological restrictions imposed by Street View and those imposed by the photographers in the course of their practice. The issue of authorship is discussed and the lack of specific authorship of Street View is related to its inability to augment the viewer's personal sense of space. Wainuiomata, a suburb of Hutt City in Wellington, New Zealand, is introduced as a location for the author's research into how documentary photography might operate. The author's own phenomenological history is considered, and it is proposed that Wainuiomata may act as a mirror which reflects a sense of place derived from personal history, triggered by the visual landscape.

The newly developed process had marked benefits over conventional processing in terms of a lowered energy usage (73%), processing time (47%) as well as water use (49%), but had been developed as a &#8220;proof of principle&#8217;&#8217;. The objective of this work was to develop the process further to a stage ready for adoption by industry. A process ready for adoption by industry is one that is able to generate good quality products (good quality products are those that has solids removed to industry standards, without visible damages to grain surface, evenly dyed etc.), require minimal changes to plant or operation layout and reduce usage of resources (e.g. water and chemicals). Mass balancing was used to investigate potential modifications for the process based on the understanding developed from a detailed analysis of preliminary design trials. Results showed that a configuration utilising a 2 stage counter-current system for the washing stages and segregation and recycling of enzyme float prior to dilution in the neutralization stage was a significant improvement. Benefits over conventional processing include a reduction of residual TDS by 50% at the washing stages and 70% savings on water use overall. Benefits over the un-optimized LASRA process are reduction of solids in product after enzyme treatment and neutralization stages by 30%, additional water savings of 21%, as well as 10% savings of enzyme usage. The optimized (new) LASRA process uses existing equipment and requires no additional outlay of capital. The process is now developed to a point where it should be trialled at industrial scale.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheepskin processing</field><field name="subject">Sheepskin tanning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering::291503 Biomaterials</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting the composition and quality of broccoli juice : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Redman, Claire T Petersen</field><field name="description">A shelf life trial using a fully balanced factorial experimental design was used to analyse the effects of acidity and light on broccoli juice made on a semi commercial scale over an eight week period in simulated retail refrigerated storage conditions.

This bolus allows real-time monitoring of the rumen environment, which could help preventing health problems such as rumen acidosis in cows. It is less invasive to use boluses compared to other technologies that measure the ruminal pH (e.g. rumenocentesis). Kahne boluses and transceivers are commercially available in the market. Several studies on the relationships between data recorded by the bolus and actual data recorded by independent devices were conducted. The bolus temperature and pressure were compared with actual temperature and pressure under controlled conditions. The pH drift was studied by comparing the difference between bolus and direct measurement over time. The capture of the data was calculated for each bolus in various experiments to examine the factors affecting the data capture rate of the boluses. Animal to animal variation was studied using boluses in a group of cows fed and managed under uniform conditions. An animal experiment involving fistulated cows eating two different diets was performed using boluses to monitor the changes of ruminal pH. There was no apparent interruption to normal animal behaviour as a result of using boluses. Regression relationships between bolus measurements and actual data for both temperature and pressure were developed and used for calibration of bolus data. The pH drift was a problem, as the regression relation between the pH difference and the time for one bolus from one experiment could not represent this bolus on other experiment. The data capture rate on the hourly basis ranged from 0 to 100%, but was usually between 30 to 70%. The data capture rate was affected by many factors and further studies to identify these factors are needed. A study of animal to animal variation suggests that in a comparison of 2 treatments, a minimum 3 cows per group would be required to detect the standard deviation of 0.11 for a pH difference of 5% of the mean (approximately 0.35 pH units). Seventeen cows per group would be required to detect the standard deviation of 0.33 for the same difference. The boluses effectively monitored the ruminal pH change in cows easting two different diets and the profile of change of pH was successfully analysed. Feeding 7.6 kg baleage twice a day cause pH to decrease at 0.009 pH units per minute during feeding, while offering a similar quantity of grass and hay once a day resulted in a decrease of 0.0009 pH units per minute during feeding. The beginning of pH increase was about 1 hour following feeding and continuous during resting and rumination. The level of pH increase did not differ significantly for two diets.. The Kahne devices appear to have advantages compared to other technologies for the measurement of parameters of the rumen environment on a real-time basis. Boluses are especially good at intensively monitoring the temperature, pressure, and pH in the rumen. The major limitations of this technology to be used are the data capture rate and the pH drift. By improving the limitations found in the experiment, the Kahne rumen sensor could become very useful for both scientific research and under commercial conditions for monitoring animal health.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rumen</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensors</field><field name="subject">Bolus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production::300403 Animal nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From caregiving to bereavement : weaving the strands of identity : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Social Work at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lee, Virginia</field><field name="description">&#8220;In what ways does the experience of caregiving for a terminally ill family member affect the experience and process of bereavement?&#8221; The identity of family caregivers in palliative care has been ambiguous: caregivers are often unaware they fit the description of &#8216;carer&#8217;. Previous research describes two contrasting constructs that shape the identity of the caregiver: burden and privilege. Research, including this study, suggests that the emergence of identity as a carer impacts on the course and experience of bereavement. Two semi &#8211; structured interviews were conducted with a small number of caregiving family members: during the caregiving role and in their subsequent bereavement. This exploratory study used phenomenological research to examine the experiences of those caregivers interviewed. The data were examined using the existential themes uncovered in analysis.

The prepared emulsions were analyzed for their storage stability and properties (colour, particle size, zeta potential and rheology). The effects of various factors (freezing/thawing, heating, pH, salts and ionic strength) on the stability of emulsions were also investigated. All emulsions prepared with an O/W ratio of 7:3, regardless of the type of milk fat, rendered a highly condensed, semi solid and cream-like substance whereas other emulsions containing less oil were in a liquid form. Among the four different O/W ratios tested, the highest emulsion stability during the storage of 12 weeks was observed from the emulsions containing 1:9 O/W ratios, due to a combine effect of smaller emulsion particle size and lower collision frequency between droplets. Interestingly, the emulsions with 7:3 O/W ratios were found to be more stable than the ones with 5:5 O/W ratios. This might be due to the limited movements of closely-packed emulsion droplets induced by the high oil concentration of 7:3 O/W ratios. The emulsion stability was significantly affected by low pH, especially at lower than pH 4, due to the loss of electrostatic repulsions between droplets leading to droplet coalescence and also possibly due to hydrolysis of rhamnolipid molecules. The presence of salts (NaCl, KCl and CaCl2) also rendered the emulsion unstable. The degree of instability was gradually increased with increasing salt concentrations. CaCl2 had the most significant effect even at a very low concentration. The viscosity of emulsions increased with increasing oil concentration but was not affected by the types of milk fats. Emulsions with 3:7, 5:5 and 7:3 O/W ratios exhibited non-Newtonian and shear thinning flow behaviour. At 7:3 O/W ratios, MF13 exhibited gel-like properties whereas both MF42 and AMF emulsions became more solid-like at higher frequency.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emulsion stability</field><field name="subject">Milk fats</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reintroducing hihi (Notiomystis cincta) to the New Zealand mainland : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science in Ecology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Richardson, Kate Mackinnon</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the potential for establishing a self-sustaining population of an endangered forest bird, the hihi (Notiomystis cincta) on the New Zealand mainland, and the factors that may influence this. Previous reintroduction attempts, mostly to offshore islands, have met with limited success, or been dependent on ongoing management. However, future conservation measures for hihi aim to reintroduce populations to the mature forest found on the mainland that hihi may be best adapted to. Such reintroductions come with new challenges for hihi conservation. The first reintroduction of hihi to this environment occurred with two releases of hihi from Tiritiri Matangi Island to &#8220;Ark in the Park&#8221;, a predator-controlled site in Auckland&#8217;s Waitakere Ranges, in February and June 2007. This study reports on the survival and dispersal of hihi following these releases, using radio transmitters for post-release monitoring, and also gives information on the vulnerability of hihi to predators, and foraging behaviour at this site. In terms of survivorship, birds released in February had higher apparent survival than those released in June, but this may have been due to higher dispersal in June. Birds released under a &#8220;delayed-release&#8221; strategy had lower long-term survival than those released immediately. There was some evidence that transmitters may have had an impact on dispersal and behaviour, but there was no evidence that transmitters reduced survival. Individuals in better condition were more likely to disperse further in the first week postrelease, but it was not possible to examine the relationship between condition and survival. Clutch size and hatching date were the two most influential factors found to affect individual condition in juvenile hihi from Tiritiri Matangi Island. It may be possible to use this information when selecting individuals for future translocations, but the impact on the source population should first be investigated, as well as the relationship between condition and survival. The failure of previous hihi reintroductions has in part been attributed to a lack of diversity of natural food in regenerating forest, and all successfully reintroduced populations to date rely on supplementary food. However, little is known about how the diet of hihi changes at different life stages, between the sexes, by season and in different habitats. In this study, such information was provided for the first time for hihi using stable isotope analysis. I found evidence for dietary shifts across different life stages (nestling, fledgling, juvenile and adult), between the sexes, and in different habitats (regenerating forest vs mature forest), and I showed that diet may be one of the proximate factors influencing individual condition.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hihi</field><field name="subject">Notiomystis cincta</field><field name="subject">Rare birds</field><field name="subject">Endangered species</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Stitchbird</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhanced surveillance of potentially foodborne enteric disease within a New Zealand public health service : thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies in Public Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Shadbolt, Tui Louise</field><field name="description">An enhanced notified enteric disease surveillance trial began on 1 July 2007 and continued until 30 June 2008. The aim of the trial was to measure the quality, timeliness and completeness of data collected and submitted by a regional Public Health Service (PHS) to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited (ESR), via the national disease database (EpiSurv) for notified cases of enteric diseases. The trial evaluated two different methods of data collection: postal questionnaires and telephone interviews. Telephone interview techniques were used to improve the contact rate, timeliness and completeness of data gathered from all notified cases of campylobacteriosis in the Manawatu, Horowhenua and Tararua regions. The target set for the project was to achieve a 95% contact rate with 90% full completion of all EpiSurv data fields. For all notified cases of campylobacteriosis a 97% contact rate was achieved in a time frame of between zero to 20 days (three day median) and completeness of all the EpiSurv case report fields ranged between 96 &#8211; 100% in the final data. Prior to the commencement of the study, between 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005, MidCentral PHS (MCPHS) made contact with around 58% of all notified cases of campylobacteriosis and 77% of all other notified enteric disease cases1 . A short pre-screen mail questionnaire, with reply-paid envelope, was sent to all notified cases of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis and yersiniosis in the MCPHS regions. EpiSurv case report fields were completed using information supplied in the returned questionnaires. Return rate, timeliness, and completeness were compared with the telephone interview group. Fifty three percent of cases we attempted to contact via mail questionnaire responded within two to 63 days (six day median) and completeness of all the EpiSurv case report fields ranged between 81 &#8211; 100%. In addition, we monitored the newly introduced ESR Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) flags for increased levels of disease compared to historical disease rates, and assessed its usefulness as a tool to identify potential outbreaks in the region. While no outbreaks that had not already been identified by PHS staff were found by monitoring the EARS system, EARS has become an important tool in the MCPHS for comparing our rates of disease with bordering PHSs. EARS also provided a good quick reference tool for media enquiries and the graphs produced in EARS have been well utilised as visual aids for training and seminars presented during the trial period. The results of the surveillance trial initiatives were compared to the rest of New Zealand (NZ) over the same time frame and with a comparable, medium-sized, PHS. While the results of the telephone interviews from the MCPHS trial were close to the comparable PHS, they were significantly higher than for the rest of NZ. The postal questionnaires achieved a lower contact rate than the comparable PHS but similar to the rest of NZ. However, the quality of data gathered in the returned MCPHS postal questionnaire was significantly higher in most fields. Additional analysis was undertaken which indicated that those cases living in higher deprivation and rural areas were less likely to respond to a postal questionnaire. An over-representation of common enteric disease notifications from rural areas in the MCPHS was also highlighted by our research. This trial has shown the effectiveness of utilising telephone interviews and telemarketing techniques for gathering timely and complete data for human enteric disease surveillance within the MCPHS. It has also demonstrated that a short pre-screen questionnaire can be effective in collecting good quality data needed to complete the standard EpiSurv case report form.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enteric disease surveillance trial</field><field name="subject">Enteric diseases</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Campylobacteriosis</field><field name="subject">Cryptosporidiosis</field><field name="subject">Giardiasis</field><field name="subject">Salmonellosis</field><field name="subject">Yersiniosis</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whatever happened to Tuatapere : are we doing very nicely thank you? : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Social Work, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Smith, Pamela Anne</field><field name="description">The focus of this study is on a rural South Island community and how it managed the dramatic social changes over the past fifty years. Government policies, changes in international trade and markets, environmental policies, globalisation, change in the structure of local and regional government and legislative changes impacted on all New Zealanders during this period but the rural hinterland of New Zealand was affected in particular ways. The township which is the focus of this study is Tuatapere on the south west corner of southern New Zealand. The researcher grew up in the district and witnessed the changes from a flourishing timber and farming service centre to a quaint tourist town. The residents and how these changes impacted on their lives are explored in this thesis through the eyes of eight long term residents. This is a qualitative study in which four men and four women were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire exploring their views on social change, the way the community has responded to changes in service provision, how they have managed the move from being a vibrant rural service community to a tourist town. This thesis celebrates their successes, tells of their hardships, explores their attitudes to change, records their life work choices and decision making. Five themes were identified from the literature and provide a framework for this study: historical influences and cultural expectations, impact of Government decisions on their lives, sense of community, sense of self and access to services. The population in rural communities has been slowly decreasing over the years as urbanisation has been a reality in New Zealand. Services within the area have diminished and younger families have moved away to seek employment elsewhere. The remaining residents are an ageing population. This brings with it a range of interesting issues for the community. The elderly have to travel for their health and other service needs and the unavailability of regular daily transport services makes it difficult for them to meet appointments. They have to rely on family and friends for transport and many no longer have the family available to support them locally. This older population also provides the pool of volunteers for recreational and social functions. The elderly feel burdened with this responsibility. The geographical isolation provides a sense of wellbeing and attraction for the residents but it also has its disadvantages. The remoteness is a deterrent for access for tourists that would bring financial advantages to the community. The isolation is also a deterrent for new inhabitants who would provide the much needed contribution to the social functioning of the community. In spite of the aforementioned difficulties with living in a remote rural corner of New Zealand the participants expressed a determination and stoicism that can only be admired.

The purpose of this thesis study was to gain an understanding and insight into the field researchers&#8217; perceptions of the positive and negative impacts such involvement may have had on their lives. The term &#8216;impact&#8217; was applied holistically and focus was given to whether negative impacts were mitigated by the positive benefits that may be present from being involved in such research. The research study design was exploratory and qualitative in nature, underpinned by a phenomenological approach. The participants were 29 Solomon Island women who had been employed in the role of &#8216;field researcher&#8217; for the Solomon Island Family Health and Safety Study. Data collection methods included the use of both in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Eleven interviews were conducted using a semi-structured approach. Three focus group discussions were facilitated, with the assistance of an open-ended questionnaire guideline. The findings identified a number of themes that emerged from the data collected. The themes highlighted primary impacts that included an emotional, physical and life-changing dimension. There was a pattern where different themes were more prevalent, dependent on what phase of the &#8216;research journey&#8217; that the researchers&#8217; were reflecting on. A significant finding was that although field researchers&#8217; primarily reported negative impacts, they all unanimously stated that they would be interested in being involved in conducting research on violence against women and children in the future. These findings not only suggest that the positive benefits from being involved in such research mitigated the many negative impacts as reported by the field researchers, but also suggest that through being involved with such research, they developed an increased commitment within their own communities to assist in reducing violence against women and children. Conducting research on violence against women and children in a developing post-conflict country brings with it many physical and emotional challenges for indigenous field researchers. It is essential that field researchers are provided with considerable support during all phases of the research study. The application of ethical and safety standards needs to reflect the unique characteristics of the country where the study is being conducted, taking into account the situational and ambient dangers that field researchers may be confronted with during their time in the field.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous researchers</field><field name="subject">Solomon Islands</field><field name="subject">Family violence</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monitoring animal disease and productivity in Samoa : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Veterinary Studies at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Taule'alo, Sina Fuatino</field><field name="description">This thesis presents two studies that form the basis of the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries&#8217; (MAF) recent efforts to enhance its animal disease surveillance capacity. The first study investigated a method of enhancing the surveillance value of veterinary case data collected by the MAF&#8217;s Animal Health Service, which provides the only veterinary service for livestock in the country, through temporal analysis of cases and syndromes by species. Threshold levels generated from 3-monthly moving averages combined over 3 years of veterinary case data were used to identify unusually high numbers of cases and the cause of these unusual events were investigated. Further, the analysis of data in the system identified gaps in the coverage of the Animal Health Service which helped identify alternative methods for conducting surveillance in these areas using the Crops Division advisory officers. The objective of the second study was to identify if the veterinary case data collected by the Animal Health Service represented pig health problems in the general population. Reproduction and mortality patterns were compared on a group of 10 holdings that were regularly attended by the veterinary staff and 13 holdings that did not utilise the Animal Health Service. The performance of these holdings, measured in liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning and post-weaning mortality were compared given their status as client or non-client of the service and their exposure to various management factors like confinement, protein supplementation, frequency of feeding, management time per sow per day, the use of improved or exotic breeds, the extent of commercial activity and, in the case of piglets their season of birth (rainy or dry season). The mean number of sows per herd was 6, producing a mean litter size of 6.1 piglets with a mean interfarrowing interval of 235 days. The median pre-weaning mortality per litter was 0 and a median of 1 piglet per litter was used for productive purposes (consumed, gifted or sold) at a median age of 153 days. It was found that the greatest influence on productivity in these holdings was nutrition. Sow productivity (in terms of liveborn piglets per sow year and pre-weaning survival) was best in the non-client, free range herds that did not provide protein supplementation (but whose feeding was unrestricted due to their freedom to roam and scavenge) and worst in client and non-client herds that were confined and not given protein supplementation (due to restricted and underfeeding). The mortality of pigs postweaning was significantly higher if they were free roaming, due to their loss to predation, theft and being hit by car. The study showed that the health status of pigs was better on holdings that did not use the Animal Health Service compared with those that did.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pigs</field><field name="subject">Swine</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Animal Health Service</field><field name="subject">Diseases</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300503 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social support in later life : the influence of retirement and marital status : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment for the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Crowe, Laura Majella</field><field name="description">The study explored the relationship between retirement and marital status and objective and subjective measures of social support.

These ponds produce a significant amount of methane but because of their large size, they are rarely covered for methane capture.  The removal of solids prior to entering the ponds would allow for shorter retention times resulting in smaller ponds that could be covered. However, removal of solids entails loss of organic material and thus methane production. It was proposed that improved hydrolysis of solid content prior to solids separation could increase the organic content of the liquid fraction. No literature was found describing two-stage (acidogenic/hydrolytic and methanogenic) systems which achieve hydrolysis combined with solids separation of manure slurries. Hence, the aim of the present study is to examine the feasibility of such a system.  Five parameters were examined to determine favourable conditions for hydrolysis of solids and acidogenesis in farm dairy effluent. These were: 1) mixing, 2) hydraulic retention time (HRT), 3) liquid to solid ratio (dilution), 4) addition of rumen contents, and 5) reactor configuration.  Continuous mixing of cow manure sludge inhibited net volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, likely due to oxygenation. By comparison, a once-daily brief stirring regime resulted in production of 785 mgVFA/Lsludge compared with 185 mg/L from a continuously stirred reactor. Mixing had little effect on soluble COD yield. HRTs ranging between 1 and 10 days resulted in greater hydrolysis yields (0.25 to 0.33 gCOD/gVSadded) compared with 0.15 gCOD/gVSadded for a 15-day HRT. It was hypothesised that the attachment of hydrolytic bacteria to solids prevented washout at shorter HRTs. In contrast, longer HRTs favoured VFA production. This may have been due to the planktonic nature of acidogenic bacteria, making them more vulnerable to washout at shorter HRTs. The effects of solid:liquid ratio on hydrolysis and acidogenesis were examined with sludge:water ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:0.25. The addition of larger volumes of water resulted in improved acidogenesis with the 1:1 sludge:water mixture producing a liquor with 245%  more VFA mass (635 mg) than reactors with a 1:0.25 sludge:water mixture (184 mg).  Addition of rumen contents was shown to have little or no effect on either acidogenesis or hydrolysis. This may have been due to a masking effect of an increased organic load through the addition of undigested grass in the rumen.  A mix, settle and decant (MSD) system and an unmixed flow-through leachbed separator system were trialled and compared as hydrolytic/acidogenic reactors.  The MSD system produced 0.033gVFA/gTSadded and 0.315gCOD/gTSadded compared with 0.015gVFA/gTSadded and 0.155gCOD/gTSadded in the unmixed leachbed separator. It was hypothesised that improved mixing and longer solid-liquid contact times in the MSD system provided greater surface contact and transfer of organics to the liquid phase thereby enhancing hydrolysis. A two-stage (acidogenic/hydrolytic and methanogenic) system was tested at bench scale. A partially mixed leachbed separator was fed with manure slurry. This retained solids while leaching out a treated feed high in organic content to be fed into a variety of methanogenic systems. The leachbed separator produced a treated feed with a VFA concentration of 562 mg/L, 120% higher than the influent slurry (255 mg/L). Soluble COD increased 60% from 1,085 mg/L in the slurry to 1,740 mg/L in the treated feed. 20-day HRT and 10-day HRT unmixed unheated methanogenic reactors, both fed with treated feed from the leachbed separator, had lower specific methane yields (0.14 and 0.11 LCH4/gVS respectively) than a 50-day HRT reactor fed with untreated slurry (0.17 LCH4/gVS). However, both the 20-day HRT reactor and the 10-day reactor had higher volumetric methane yields (0.033 and 0.057 LCH4/Lreactor/day respectively) than the 50-day HRT reactor fed with slurry (0.024 LCH4/Lreactor/day). Gas production was shown to rise as the VFA levels in the treated feed rose. Fermentation in the leachbed followed by separation was shown to improve average gas production by up to 57% compared to separation alone.  Field-scale trials of a leachbed separator system followed by a 20-day HRT methanogenic reactor were undertaken. VFA concentrations increased from 100 mg/l in the influent to 1,260 mg/l in the treated feed, while the soluble COD increased from 2,766 mg/L to 5,542 mg/L. The methanogenic reactor produced 0.08 m3 CH4/ m3reactor/day, four times higher than that which would be expected from a covered pond of the same size. This was hypothesised to be due to the increased biodigestability of the feed to the tank digester as well the increased organic loading rate. This study indicates that the use of a leachbed separator would be an effective low-tech strategy for reducing the HRT of farm anaerobic ponds, and reducing the size of covers required for biogas energy recovery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Effluent treatment</field><field name="subject">Dairy waste</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering::291102 Bio-remediation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renovating midwifery care : the complexity of organisational change for midwives in Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Carole</field><field name="description">The importance of the role of the midwife in providing safe, quality care for women has until recently, been underrated in Victoria, Australia. Acknowledgement of the need for midwife-led models of care in state maternity service policies provided opportunities for midwives to become recognised within the healthcare system and the wider community. This professional doctorate aims to examine the ways in which the role of the midwife and her practice has been impacted on by organisational renovations of midwifery care. It identifies the complexity of the factors that affect the midwife&#8217;s ability or choice to work in midwife-led models of care. Furthermore this doctorate highlights the need for ongoing debate into midwifery in Australia. Concepts related to midwifery practice are examined as they form the foundations for the research and policy components of the portfolio. This includes an exploration of midwifery philosophy, the antecedents to autonomous practice and the experience midwives have of midwife-led care. An examination of the concepts of continuity of care and woman-centred care provides a platform upon which to review models of midwifery care. This review highlights the development of an ongoing relationship as a source of satisfaction for midwives and women. The second part of the doctorate reviews policies that guide the provision of maternity services in Victoria. Analysis of these policies using Kingdon&#8217;s multiple streams framework identifies the problems, the political actors and the policy developed, establishing the context for organisational change in maternity care. The antecedents for successful integration of organisational change are explored through a review of change theory and leadership. A case study approach utilised for the research component of the doctorate provides insights into organisational change that occurred at two maternity sites in Victoria. The findings of the study suggest there was a dichotomy between those midwives desiring autonomous practice and wanting to work in midwife-led care and those wishing to remain in one specialised area. Recommendations stemming from these findings include the need for sufficient education and support during change, a review of terminology used to describe midwifery models of care and research into the use of integrated maternity units. Complexity science is examined in order to bring the different strands of the doctorate together, providing an explanation for the different outcomes that occur despite the implementation of similar models. The connective leadership model was suggested as the means to provide leadership that is inclusive of providing direction, mentoring new leaders and providing support and opportunities for midwives to become empowered to practice autonomously. Attention to the complexity of organisational change is vital to ensure the future of midwifery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery.</field><field name="subject">Organizational change.</field><field name="subject">Midwives.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pulse oximetry during neonatal transition: the POINT studies</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Jennifer Anne</field><field name="description">The objectives for the first part of this thesis were to describe changes in oxygen saturation (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) in newly born infants in the delivery room (DR) and to illustrate the changes using centile reference charts.

They are caused by large collections of neutral hydrogen (HI) gas, which are thought to be housed in galaxies that lie along the line-of-sight to quasars. HI gas associated with DLAs contains most of the HI gas in the Universe during 2 &lt; z &lt; 5, and hence details about DLAs are important for understanding the history of star formation, as well as the formation and evolution of galaxies. Wyithe (2008) proposed a method of determining the characteristic mass of dark matter haloes that host DLAs. This involves generating an analytic power spectrum of the fluctuations in 21cm brightness temperature caused by the HI gas in the Universe. Calculating this analytic 21cm power spectrum requires a formalism for the HI mass weighted clustering bias of DLAs on both large and small scales. We include this DLA clustering bias by firstly generating an analytic galaxy power spectrum using the halo model of Peacock &amp; Smith (2000), as well as including the occupation of haloes by galaxies -- using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) weighting of Peacock (2003). This weighting is then adapted to account for the occupation of haloes by HI gas.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmology, large-scale structure of the Universe, quasar absorption systems, Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (DLAs), galaxies, evolution, N-body simulations</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolic consequences of lipid-oversupply in key glucoregulatory tissues.</field><field name="creator">Turpin, Sarah Maggie</field><field name="description">Obesity and type 2 diabetes are the most prevalent metabolic diseases in the western world and affect over 50% of the world&#8217;s population. During obesity non-adipose tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle take up and store excess fatty acids (FA) as lipids such as triacylglycerols (TAG) and diacylglycerols (DAG). Excessive lipid storage in non-adipose tissues can result in the dysfunction of cellular processes and lead to programmed cell death (apoptosis). Lipid-induced apoptosis was investigated in the key glucoregulatory tissues, the liver and skeletal muscle. Lipid-induced apoptosis was detected in vitro in both hepatocytes and myotubes but was not detected in the livers or skeletal muscles of genetically obese mice or high-fat fed mice. Further investigation discovered despite exacerbated TAG accumulation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) was not activated in the liver and pathways of cellular remodelling (proteolysis and autophagy) were not initiated in skeletal muscle. These studies demonstrated that the liver and skeletal muscle are adaptable to increased lipid storage in physiological models but not isolated cell culture systems. In vitro experiments demonstrated unsaturated FAs could protect hepatocytes from lipoapoptosis and it has been suggested this is due to driving FA accumulation into TAG lipid droplets. Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is one of the primary TAG lipases. To explore TAG metabolism in the liver, primary hepatocytes were derived from ATGL null mice and ATGL was over-expressed in the livers of chronically obese mice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fatty acid, skeletal muscle, liver</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and their journals: navigating depression through consciousness-raising, resistance and action</field><field name="creator">Western, Deborah Jane</field><field name="description">Depression in women is a major mental health issue and social work practitioners can, at some stage in their careers, expect to work with women experiencing depression.

These portraits are examined in detail and are placed within the contexts of the existing scholarship on Franz Xaver Winterhalter, British portrait painting of the 1830s and 1840s, and the patronage of portraiture in Britain during the reigns of William IV and Queen Victoria. The thesis compares and contrasts these works with official representations of Queen Victoria and her husband by British artists; and examines the concept of &#8220;gender reversal&#8221; within the accepted notion of marital pendants by highlighting Winterhalter&#8217;s innovations in the genre of official portraiture.The thesis challenges the perception that Winterhalter&#8217;s employment at the court of Queen Victoria was due to the Queen&#8217;s alleged penchant for &#8220;all things German&#8221; by placing Winterhalter&#8217;s portraits within the context of the British Royal Collection. It examines the reasons for the artist&#8217;s success at the British court, accentuating among others Winterhalter&#8217;s ability to conceptualise in his portraits of Prince Albert the hierarchically-complex position of the Prince Consort. The overarching arguments of the thesis focus on two propositions - that by employing a foreign artist as her official image maker, Queen Victoria acquired ultimate control over the production, distribution and popularisation of her own imagery; and that this patronage is illustrative of the emergence of a royal and aristocratic international iconography that overrode the competing concept of &#8216;national&#8217; schools of art.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Franz Xaver Winterhalter (1805-1873), Queen Victoria (1819-1901), Prince Albert (1819-1861), portrait painting, portraiture</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/7154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial complexity and microclimatic responses of epiphyte communities and their invertebrate fauna in the canopy of northern rata (Metrosideros robusta A. Cunn.: Myrtaceae) on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Affeld, Kathrin</field><field name="description">Rain forest canopies are renowned for their very high biodiversity and the critical role they play in key ecological processes and their influence on global climate. Despite that New Zealand supports one of the most diverse and extensive epiphyte flora of any temperate forest system, few studies have investigated epiphyte communities and their invertebrate fauna along with factors that influence their distribution and composition. This thesis represents the first comprehensive study of entire epiphyte communities and their resident invertebrate fauna in the canopy of New Zealand&#8217;s indigenous forests. The aim of this study was to determine spatial patterns of epiphyte and invertebrate species richness, abundance and community composition in relation to abiotic variables, and in particular, the responses of these communities to elevated temperature and rainfall. This study was carried out in coastal lowland podocarp-broadleaved forests at two sites on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Samples from 120 mat-forming epiphyte assemblages located on inner canopy branches of 40 northern rata (Metrosideros robusta) trees were studied to characterise the component flora and fauna. Additionally, biomass, branch and tree characteristics and community responses to treatments designed to elevate temperature and rainfall to simulate predicted climate change were measured.  This investigation revealed astonishing diversity and functional complexity of epiphyte and invertebrate life in this ecosystem. The 30.6 kg (dry weight) of epiphyte material collected contained a total of 567 species, 170 epiphyte and 397 invertebrate (excluding immature specimens and mites) species, including at least 10 species new to science and many undescribed species Epiphyte communities were found to be dominated by non-vascular plants (80 % of the total species richness), particularly liverworts and invertebrate communities were dominated with respect to abundance (~ 80 % of the total individuals) by Acari, Collembola and Hymenoptera (primarily ants) and functionally by scavengers and ants.  Epiphyte and invertebrate communities were highly variable with respect to spatial patterning of species richness, abundance and composition across sites, among trees within sites and among branches within trees. Overall, a highly significant proportion, &gt; 75 %, of the variance could be attributed to differences at the branch level, but these differences could not be explained by the environmental factors measured. There were no consistent relationships between the spatial pattern of epiphytes and invertebrates, or between vascular and non-vascular plants. However, there were significant positive correlations between epiphyte biomass and invertebrate species richness (r = 0.472; p &lt; 0.0001) and abundance (r = -0.395; p &lt; 0.0001), as well as non-living epiphyte biomass and scavenger species richness (r = 0.4; p &lt; 0.0001). Microclimatic measurements taken on epiphyte mats were also highly variable with respect to temperature and relative humidity at similar physical locations within the same tree as well as across trees within sites. There was also considerable variation in the intensity and frequency of climatic extremes, although potentially harmful climatic conditions were experienced by all the epiphyte mats for which weather variables were measured. Negative correlations existed between both epiphyte and invertebrate community composition and increased temperatures expressed as cumulative degree days above 5&#730;C. However, variability was such that there was no direct evidence that increased temperature and rainfall treatments had an effect on invertebrate species richness, abundance or diversity.  Northern rata host trees harbour an astonishingly diverse and complex canopy flora and fauna that is characterised by high spatial variability. Such variability highlights that to determine species distribution and community dynamics in canopy habitats in response to disturbance caused either by climate change or invasive species the structure of entire communities at different taxonomic and spatial scales, along with their responses to microclimatic factors, need to be studied. If such complexities are not taken into account, inappropriate interpretation may result in poor decisions concerning the conservation status, vulnerability and subsequent management of such unique ecosystems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">abundance</field><field name="subject">biomass</field><field name="subject">bryophytes</field><field name="subject">canopy</field><field name="subject">climate change</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">community composition</field><field name="subject">epiphytes</field><field name="subject">guild composition</field><field name="subject">invertebrates</field><field name="subject">lichens</field><field name="subject">microclimate</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">non-vascular plants</field><field name="subject">relative humidity</field><field name="subject">species richness</field><field name="subject">temperate rain forest</field><field name="subject">temperature</field><field name="subject">vapour pressure deficit</field><field name="subject">vascular plants</field><field name="subject">060208 - Terrestrial Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing the effect of in planta RNA silencing on Plasmodiophora brassicae infection</field><field name="creator">Bulman, S. R.</field><field name="description">In the late 1990s, a series of landmark publications described RNA interference (RNAi) and related RNA silencing phenomena in nematodes, plants and fungi. By manipulating RNA silencing, biologists have been able to create tools for specifically inactivating genes. In organisms from trypanosomes to insects, RNA silencing is now indispensible for studying gene function. RNA silencing has been used in a project aimed at systematically knocking out all genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  RNA silencing has a natural role in defending eukaryotic cells against virus replication. By assembling virus DNA sequences in a form that triggers RNA silencing, biologists have created plants resistant to specific viruses. In this study, we set out to test if a similar approach would protect plants against infection by the agriculturally important Brassica pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae. P. brassicae is an obligate intracellular biotroph, from the little studied eukaryotic supergroup, the Rhizaria.  To identify the gene sequences that would be starting material for P. brassicae RNA silencing, new P. brassicae genes were gathered by cDNA cloning or genomic PCR-walking. Using suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) and oligo-capping cloning of full-length cDNAs, 76 new gene sequences were identified. A large proportion of the cDNAs were predicted to contain signal peptides for ER translocation.  In addition to the new cDNA identified here, partial sequences for the P. brassicae actin and TPS genes were published by other researchers close to the beginning of this study. Using PCR-walking, full-length genomic DNA sequences from both genes were obtained. Later, genomic DNA sequences spanning or flanking a total of 24 P. brassicae genes were obtained. The P. brassicae genes were rich in typical eukaryotic spliceosomal introns. Transcription of P. brassicae genes also appears likely to begin from initiator elements rather than TATA-box-containing promoters.  A segment of the P. brassicae actin gene was assembled in hairpin format and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. Observation of simultaneous knockdown of the GUS marker gene as well as detection of siRNAs indicated that the hpRNA sequences induced RNA silencing. However, inoculation of these plants with P. brassicae resulted in heavy club root infection. We were unable to detect decreases in actin gene expression in the infecting P. brassicae, at either early or late stages of infection. We conclude that, within the limits of the techniques used here, there is no evidence for induction of RNA silencing in P. brassicae by in planta produced siRNAs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasmodiophora brassicae</field><field name="subject">club root</field><field name="subject">Rhizaria</field><field name="subject">RNA interference</field><field name="subject">in planta RNA silencing</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="subject">suppression subtractive hybridisation</field><field name="subject">cDNA cloning</field><field name="subject">genome</field><field name="subject">intron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the biology and population dynamics of Synanthedon tipuliformis (Clerck) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) in Canterbury, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Scott, R. R.</field><field name="description">The study covered the period August 1971 to February 1975 and was conducted in three blackcurrant plots. One plot comprised mature bushes that were pruned but not sprayed during the course of the study; the other two plots were subject to full normal managerial practices including spraying. Information on various aspects of the biology was revealed and this clarified some of the areas about which little was known previously especially for the Southern Hemisphere. Fecundity is 100 eggs per female, fertility in the field is at least 97% and predation of eggs is always less than 5%. There are six larval instars. Fungi of the genera Beauveria and Cordyceps cause up to 10% mortality of the larvae. This is the first record of the latter genus infecting S. tipuliformis.  A sampling plan was developed to enable estimates of the population of S. tipuliformis at various stages to be obtained. This gave information on the distribution of stages of the life cycle within the canes according to the age of the wood. These samples also permitted the construction of life tables for three generations of S. tipuliformis in one plot and one generation in the others. Replication both in space and time was therefore achieved and the results were further replicated by considering each plot as nine separate blocks. The dispersion of the egg and larval stages was tested and found to fit the negative binomial model. A common k, kc, was calculated for the egg stage and the larval c stage. Though not vital to this present study various transformations of the raw data were investigated to see which were most appropriate in order to stabilise the variance for analyses in which such suitability is vital. The logarithmic transformation based on the k parameter of the k negative model [log (x + k/2)) was the most successful. The mortality of the eggs was quite low but a significant proportion of the emerging larvae fail to colonise the pith of a cane. This mortality is density dependent. Other mortalities including winter pruning are density independent or random. The key stage of the life cycle revealed by the life tables is the adult survival. This survival and the consequent population trend index determined from the number of eggs laid was found to be affected by the prevailing weather during the flight period especially during the last week of November and the first two weeks of December.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">current clearwing</field><field name="subject">Synanthedon tipuliformis</field><field name="subject">blackcurrants</field><field name="subject">Ribes nigrum L.</field><field name="subject">pruning</field><field name="subject">infestation</field><field name="subject">pith-boring</field><field name="subject">sampling</field><field name="subject">population dynamics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300300 Horticulture::300303 Plant protection (pests, diseases and weeds)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemical nature and plant availability of phosphorus present in soils under long-term fertilised irrigated pastures in Canterbury, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Condron, Leo M.</field><field name="description">Soil P fractionation was used to examine changes in soil inorganic and organic P under grazed irrigated pasture in a long-term field trial at Winchmore in Mid-Canterbury. The soil P fractionation scheme used involved sequential extractions of soil with O.5M NaHCO&#8323; @ pH 8.5 (NaHCO&#8323; P), 0.1M NaOH (NaOH I P), 1M HCl (HCl P) and 0.1M NaOH (NaOH II P). The Winchmore trial comprised 5 treatments: control (no P since 1952), 376R (376 kg superphosphate ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; 1952-1957, none since), 564R (564 kg superphosphate ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; 1952-1957, none since) 188PA (188 kg superphosphate ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; since 1952) and 376PA (376 kg superphosphate ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; since 1952: Topsoil (0-7.5cm) samples taken from the different treatments in 1958, 1961, 1965, 1968, 1971, 1974 and 1977 were used in this study. Changes in soil P with time showed that significant increases in soil inorganic P occurred in the annually fertilised treatments (l88PA, 376PA).  As expected, the overall increase in total soil inorganic P between 1958 and 1977 was greater in the 376PA treatment (159 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) than that in the 188PA treatment (37 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;). However, the chemical forms of inorganic P which accumulated in the annually fertilised treatments changed with time. Between 1958 and 1971 most of the increases in soil inorganic P in these treatments occurred in the NaHCO&#8323; and NaOH I P fractions. On the other hand, increases in soil inorganic P in the annually fertilised treatments between 1971 and 1977 were found mainly in the HCl and NaOH II P fractions. These changes in soil P forms were attributed to the combined effects of lime addition in 1972 and increased amounts of sparingly soluble apatite P and iron-aluminium P in the single superphosphate applied during the 1970's.  In the residual fertiliser treatments (376R, 564R) significant decreases in all of the soil inorganic P fractions (i.e. NaHCO&#8323; P, NaOH I P, HCl P, NaOH II p) occurred between 1958 and 1977 following the cessation of P fertiliser inputs in 1957. This was attributed to continued plant uptake of P accumulated in the soil from earlier P fertiliser additions. However, levels of inorganic P in the different soil P fractions in the residual fertiliser treatments did not decline to those in the control which indicated that some of the inorganic P accumulated in the soil from P fertiliser applied between 1952 and 1957 was present in very stable forms.  In all treatments, significant increases in soil organic P occurred between 1958 and 1971. The overall increases in total soil organic P were greater in the annually fertilised treatments (70-86 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) than those in the residual fertiliser (55-64 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) and control (34 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) treatments which reflected the respective levels of pasture production in the different treatments. These increases in soil organic P were attributed to the biological conversion of native and fertiliser inorganic P to organic P in the soil via plant, animal and microbial residues. The results also showed that annual rates of soil organic P accumulation between 1958 and 1971 decreased with time which indicated that steady-state conditions with regard to net 'organic P accumulation were being reached.  In the residual fertiliser treatments, soil organic P continued to increase between 1958 and 1971 while levels of soil inorganic P and pasture production declined. This indicated that organic P which accumulated in soil from P fertiliser additions was more stable and less available to plants than inorganic forms of soil P.  Between 1971 and 1974 small (10-38 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) but significant decreases in total soil organic P occurred in all treatments. This was attributed to increased mineralisation of soil organic P as a result of lime (4 t ha&#8315;&#185;) applied to the trial in 1972 and also to the observed cessation of further net soil organic P accumulation after 1971. Liming also appeared to affect the chemical nature of soil organic P as shown by the large decreases in NaOH I organic P(78-88 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) and concomitant smaller increases in NaOH II organic P (53-65 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) which occurred in all treatments between 1971 and 1974.  The chemical nature of soil organic P in the Winchmore long-term trial was also investigated using 31p nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography. This involved quantitative extraction of organic P from the soil by sequential extraction with 0.1M NaOH, 0.2M aqueous acetylacetone (pH 8.3) and 0.5M NaOH following which the extracts were concentrated by ultrafiltration. Soils (0-7.5cm) taken from the control and 376PA annually fertilised treatments in 1958, 1971 and 1983 were used in this study.   31p NMR analysis showed that most (88-94%) of the organic P in the Winchmore soils was present as orthophosphate monoester P while the remainder was found as orthophosphate diester and pyrophosphate P. Orthophosphate monoester P also made up almost all of the soil organic P which accumulated in the 376PA treatment between 1958 and 1971. This indicated that soil organic P in the 376PA and control treatments was very stable.  The gel filtration studies using Sephadex G-100 showed that most (61-83%) of the soil organic P in the control and 376PA treatments was present in the low molecular weight forms (&lt;100,000 MW), although the proportion of soil organic P in high molecular weight forms (&gt;100,000 MW) increased from 17-19% in 1958 to 38-39% in 1983. The latter was attributed to the microbial humification of organic P and indicated a shift toward more complex and possibly more stable forms of organic P in the soil with time.  Assuming that the difference in soil organic P between the control and 376PA soils sampled in 1971 and 1983 represented the organic P derived from P fertiliser additions, results showed that this soil organic P was evenly distributed between the high and low molecular weight fractions. An exhaustive pot trial was used to examine the relative availability to plants of different forms of soil inorganic and organic P in long-term fertilised pasture soils. This involved growing 3 successive crops of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) in 3 Lismore silt loam (Udic Ustochrept) soils which had received different amounts of P fertiliser for many years. Two of the soils were taken from the annually fertilised treatments in the Winchmore long term trial (188PA, 376PA) and the third (Fairton) was taken from a pasture which had been irrigated with meatworks effluent for over 80 years (65 kg P ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185;). Each soil was subjected to 3 treatments, namely control (no nutrients added), N100 and N200. The latter treatments involved adding complete nutrient solutions with different quantities of N at rates of 100kg N ha&#8315;&#185; (N100) and 200kg N ha&#8315;&#185; (N200) on an area basis. The soil P fractionation scheme used was the same as that used in the Winchmore long-term trial study (i.e. NaHCO&#8323; P, NaOH I P, HCl P, NaOH II p). Results obtained showed that the availability to plants of different extracted inorganic P fractions, as measured by decreases in P fractions before and after 3 successive crops, followed the order: NaHCO&#8323; P &gt; NaOH I P &gt; HCl P = NaOH II P. Overall decreases in the NaHCO&#8323; and NaOH I inorganic P fractions were 34% and 16% respectively, while corresponding decreases in the HCl and NaOH II inorganic P fractions were small &#171;10%) and not significant. However, a significant decrease in HCl P (16%) was observed in one soil (Fairton-N200 treatment) which was attributed to the significant decrease in soil pH (from 6.2 to 5.1) which occurred after successive cropping.  Successive cropping had little or no effect on the levels of P in the different soil organic P fractions. This indicated that net soil organic P mineralisation did not contribute significantly to plant P uptake over the short-term.  A short-term field experiment was also conducted to examine the effects of different soil management practices on the availability of different forms of P to plants in the long-term fertilised pasture soils. The trial was sited on selected plots of the existing annually fertilised treatments in the Winchmore long-term trial (188PA, 376PA) and comprised 5 treatments: control, 2 rates of lime (2 and 4 t ha&#8315;&#185; ) , urea fertiliser (400kg N ha&#8315;&#185; ) and mechanical cultivation.  The above ground herbage in the uncultivated treatments was harvested on 11 occasions over a 2 year period and at each harvest topsoil (0-7.5 cm) samples were taken from all of the treatments for P analysis. The soil P fractionation scheme used in this particular trial involved sequential extractions with 0.5M NaHCO&#8323; @ pH 8.5 (NaHCO&#8323; P), 0.1M NaOH (NaOH P), ultrasonification with 0.1M NaOH (sonicate-NaOH p) and 1M HCl (HCl P). In addition, amounts of microbial P in the soils were determined.  The results showed that liming resulted in small (10-21 &#181;g P g&#8315;&#185;) though significant decreases in the NaOH soil organic P fraction in the 188PA and 376PA plots. Levels of soil microbial P were also found to be greater in the limed treatments compared with those in the controls. These results indicated that liming increased the microbial mineralisation of soil organic P in the Winchmore soils. However, pasture dry matter yields and P uptake were not significantly affected.  Although urea significantly increased dry matter yields and P uptake, it did not appear to significantly affect amounts of P in the different soil P fractions. Mechanical cultivation and the subsequent fallow period (18 months) resulted in significant increases in amounts of P in the NaHCO&#8323; and NaOH inorganic P fractions. This was attributed to P released from the microbial decomposition of plant residues, although the absence of plants significantly reduced levels of microbial P in the cultivated soils.  Practical implications of the results obtained in the present study were presented and discussed.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil inorganic P</field><field name="subject">soil organic P</field><field name="subject">P immobilisation</field><field name="subject">P mineralisation</field><field name="subject">soil P fractionation</field><field name="subject">single superphosphate</field><field name="subject">residual fertiliser P</field><field name="subject">Lime-P interactions</field><field name="subject">soil organic P molecular weight</field><field name="subject">&#179;&#185;P NMR</field><field name="subject">perennial ryegrass</field><field name="subject">plant P uptake</field><field name="subject">soil pH</field><field name="subject">urea fertiliser</field><field name="subject">cultivation</field><field name="subject">050304 - Soil Chemistry (excl.

It has a long history of human modification and impacts since its colonisation by Maori and early Europeans. The vegetation of Maud Island has been studied in the 1980's and again in the early 1990's. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe how the vascular plant communities vary in species composition across Maud Island, (2) determine which environmental factors are important predictors of the variation in species composition of Maud Island plant communities, and (3) describe the pattern of succession of the plant communities on Maud Island over the last twenty years. In this 2001 study, I comprehensively sampled the vegetation on Maud Island using a Reconnaissance Description Procedure in a total of 158 plots across the island and compared these results to previous descriptions. I also retook photos at permanent photo points to provide a visual comparison of vegetation change. In total, 219 plant species were identified; 177 species occurred within the plots and 42 additional species were observed while walking around the coastline and walking tracks. Six dominant plant species occurred in over 70% of the plots. They were Pteridium esculentum, Pseudopanax arboreus, Hebe stricta var. stricta, Melicytus ramiflorus, Ozothamnus leptophylla and Coprosma robusta. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis resulted in the description of eight different plant communities on the island. Detrended correspondence analysis showed a high degree of turnover in species composition among these communities. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that slope and moisture were particularly important predictors of variation in plant species composition. The environmental factors that best predicted to variation communities were slope, moisture, and a gradient in historical disturbance. Comparisons of present and past vegetation maps and photos (ground and aerial) showed, in terms of the successional pathways of the vegetation on Maud Island, that over time, the vegetation is reverting from short stature grassland and scrub to predominantly forest scrub and young secondary forest.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant communities</field><field name="subject">species composition</field><field name="subject">Maud Island</field><field name="subject">environmental impacts</field><field name="subject">vegetation study</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300801 Environmental management and rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300804 Environmental impact assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Y1 receptor for NPY: a novel regulator of immune cell function</field><field name="creator">Wheway, Julie Elizabeth, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychological conditions, including stress, compromise immune defenses. Although this concept is not novel, the molecular mechanism behind it remains unclear. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), regulates anxiety and is a part of the stress response. The NPY system also modulates immune functions such as cytokine release, cell migration, and innate immune cell activity. Postganglionic sympathetic nerves innervating lymphoid organs release NPY, which together with other peptides activate five receptors (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6). Additionally, immune cells themselves release NPY following activation. Previous studies have shown that Y1 mediates NPY-immune effects and data presented here shows expression of Y1 on a wide range of immune cells. Results presented in this thesis, using Y1-deficient mice (Y1-/-), have uncovered a novel role for Y1 on immune cells. NPY acts endogenously to inhibit T cell activation whereas Y1-/- T cells are hyper-responsive to activation and trigger severe colitis after transfer into lymphopenic mice. Thus, signalling through the Y1 receptor on T cells inhibits T cell activation and controls the magnitude of T cell responses. Paradoxically, in Y1-/- mice, T cell differentiation to Th1 T cells appears to be defective as these mice were resistant to T helper type 1 (Th1) cell???mediated inflammatory responses and showed reduced levels of the Th1 cell???promoting cytokine interleukin 12 and reduced interferon ?? production. This defect was due to functionally impaired antigen presenting cells (APCs). Y1-deficient APCs are defective in their ability to produce Th1-promoting cytokines and present antigens to T cells and consequently, Y1-/- mice had reduced numbers of effector T cells. Key reciprocal bone marrow chimera experiments indicated that this effect is intrinsic to immune cells and not driven by other Y1-expressing cell types. These results demonstrate a fundamental bimodal role for the Y1 receptor in the immune system, serving as a strong negative regulator on T cells as well as a key activator of APC function. The findings presented in this thesis uncover a sophisticated molecular mechanism regulating immune cell functions and thus adds to a growing number of signalling pathways shared by the immune and nervous system.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neuropeptides</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Immune response -- Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of c-Jun in angiogenesis and cancer: insights using gene targeting approaches</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Guishui, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease and cancer are the two most common causes of death worldwide. Angiogenesis plays a critical role tumourigenesis and atherogenesis. As a member of the basic region-leucine zipper protein family, c-Jun, has been linked with cell proliferation, migration and cell survival. However, the relationship between c-Jun and angiogenesis has not been firmly established.  In this thesis, strategies targeting c-Jun mRNA such as DNAzyme and siRNA have been designed and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the c-Jun mRNA and c-Jun protein expression in vitro and in vivo. These agents block c-Jun expression and inhibit DNA binding activity of c-Jun. Luciferase assay showed that c-Jun siRNA suppressed c-Jun/AP-1-dependent reporter activity. The processes of cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation were all down-regulated after treatment with c-Jun targeting agents. In vivo, c-Jun DNAzymes and siRNA inhibit angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis in multiple models of angiogenesis, including tumour angiogenesis and growth, matrix angiogenesis, corneal angiogenesis and retinal neovascularization. This is mediated, at least in part, by c-Jun siRNA or DNAzyme inhibition of MMP-2 expression.  These findings demonstrate the critical role played by c-Jun in the involvement of neovascularization and suggest that DNAzymes or siRNAs are efficient gene-silencing agents. The ability to identify and control key genes in angiogenesis provides opportunities for developing therapeutic molecular tools to treat cancer or other angiogenesis related diseases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular disease -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Angiography</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of activation and implementation of the medical emergency team system</field><field name="creator">Cretikos, Michelle, School of Anaesthetics, Intensive Care &amp; Emergency Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem investigated: The activation and implementation of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) system. Procedures followed: The ability of the objective activation criteria to accurately identify patients at risk of three serious adverse events (cardiac arrest, unexpected death and unplanned intensive care admission) was assessed using a nested, matched case-control study. Sensitivity, specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were performed. The MET implementation process was studied using two convenience sample surveys of the nursing staff from the general wards of twelve intervention hospitals. These surveys measured the awareness and understanding of the MET system, level of attendance at MET education sessions, knowledge of the activation criteria, level of intention to call the MET and overall attitude to the MET system, and the hospital level of support for change, hospital capability and hospital culture. The association of these measures with the intention to call the MET and the level of MET utilisation was assessed using nonparametric  correlation.  Results obtained: The respiratory rate was missing in 20% of subjects. Using listwise deletion, the set of objective activation criteria investigated predicted an adverse event within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 55.4% (50.6-60.0%) and specificity of 93.7% (91.2-95.6%). An analysis approach that assumed the missing values would not have resulted in MET activation provided a sensitivity of 50.4% (45.7- 55.2%) and specificity of 93.3% (90.8-95.3%). Alternative models with modified cut-off values provided different results. The MET system was implemented with variable success during the MERIT study. Knowledge and understanding of the system, hospital readiness, and a positive attitude were all significantly positively associated with MET system utilisation, while defensive hospital cultures were negatively associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Major conclusions: The objective activation criteria studied have acceptable accuracy, but modification of the criteria may be considered. A satisfactory trade-off between the identification of patients at risk and workload requirements may be difficult to achieve. Measures of effectiveness of the implementation process may be associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Trials of the MET system should ensure good knowledge and understanding of the system, particularly amongst nursing staff.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiotherapy in cancer care: estimating the optimal utilization from a review of evidence-based clinical guidelines.</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Geoffrey, South-west Sydney Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Radiotherapy utilization rates for cancer vary widely internationally. It has previously been suggested that approximately 50% of all cancer patients should receive radiation. However, this estimate was not evidence-based. The aim of this study was to estimate the ideal proportion of new cases of cancer that should receive radiotherapy at least once during the course of their illness based on the best available evidence.  Materials and Methods: An optimal radiotherapy utilization tree was constructed for each cancer based upon indications for radiotherapy taken from evidence-based treatment guidelines. The proportion of patients with clinical attributes that indicated a possible benefit from radiotherapy was obtained by adding epidemiological data to the radiotherapy utilization tree. The optimal proportion of patients with cancer that should receive radiotherapy was then calculated using TreeAge software. Sensitivity analyses using univariate analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.  Results: The proportion of patients with cancer in whom external beam radiotherapy is indicated according to the best available evidence was calculated to be 52%. Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the 95% confidence limits were from 51.7% to 53.1%. The tightness of the confidence interval suggests that the overall estimate is robust. Comparison with actual radiotherapy utilization data suggests a shortfall in actual radiotherapy delivery.  Conclusion: This methodology allows comparison of optimal rates with actual rates to identify areas where improvements in the evidence-based use of radiotherapy can be made. It provides valuable data for radiotherapy service planning. Actual rates need to be addressed to ensure better radiotherapy utilization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metallisation and interconnection of polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Timothy M, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film photovoltaics seem set to become a large part of future photovoltaic production worldwide, due to the fact that thin-film photovoltaic modules have the potential to be manufactured for a significantly lower cost per peak Watt of photovoltaic electricity produced than traditional wafer-based photovoltaic modules. Of particular interest are polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) thin-film photovoltaic devices on foreign supporting superstrates such as glass, because they combine the best features of wafer-based modules (long-term stability, vast manufacturing experience) with the best features of thin-film modules (lower materials cost, and monolithic construction techniques). Since polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass superstrates are a relatively recent development in photovoltaics, there remains much scope for the investigation and implementation of novel metallisation and interconnection schemes. This thesis is concerned with the invention and development of metallisation and interconnection schemes for this new photovoltaic material, poly-Si on glass. In this thesis, several new metallisation and interconnection schemes for poly-Si solar cells on glass superstrates were invented and investigated: - The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme, which is based on cells with interdigitated n-type and p-type contacts, and subsequent inter-connection of individual cells. - The metal-free interconnection scheme, which relies on laser-doping of regions of the silicon film to interconnect adjacent cells, and does not require metal contacts. - The spanning-gap interconnection scheme, which involves laser-scribing of the silicon film, and overdoping one sidewall of each laser scribe, then connecting adjacent cells by filling the laser scribe with metal. - The wrap-over interconnection scheme, which employs laser scribing and insulating and conductive laser-scribe sidewalls, and a metal layer which interconnects adjacent cells. Also investigated was the specific contact resistance of each type of metal-semiconductor contact used in the various interconnection schemes. The various interconnection schemes were developed to different levels of completion. The sequential metallisation and interconnection scheme yielded fully functioning mini-modules with good efficiencies. The wrap-over interconnection scheme made it to the proof of concept stage, while the other two schemes did not reach completion due to various technical difficulties and time constraints.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35216</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On semiparametric regression and data mining</field><field name="creator">Ormerod, John T, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Semiparametric regression is playing an increasingly large role in the analysis of datasets exhibiting various complications (Ruppert, Wand &amp; Carroll, 2003). In particular semiparametric regression a plays prominent role in the area of data mining where such complications are numerous (Hastie, Tibshirani &amp; Friedman, 2001). In this thesis we develop fast, interpretable methods addressing many of the difficulties associated with data mining applications including: model selection, missing value analysis, outliers and heteroscedastic noise.  We focus on function estimation using penalised splines via mixed model methodology (Wahba 1990; Speed 1991; Ruppert et al. 2003). In dealing with the difficulties associated with data mining applications many of the models we consider deviate from typical normality assumptions. These models lead to likelihoods involving analytically intractable integrals. Thus, in keeping with the aim of speed, we seek analytic approximations to such integrals which are typically faster than numeric alternatives.  These analytic approximations not only include popular penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) approximations (Breslow &amp; Clayton, 1993) but variational approximations. Originating in physics, variational approximations are a relatively new class of approximations (to statistics) which are simple, fast, flexible and effective. They have recently been applied to statistical problems in machine learning where they are rapidly gaining popularity (Jordan, Ghahramani, Jaakkola &amp; Sau11999; Corduneanu &amp; Bishop, 2001; Ueda &amp; Ghahramani, 2002; Bishop &amp; Winn, 2003; Winn &amp; Bishop 2005).  We develop variational approximations to: generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs); Bayesian GLMMs; simple missing values models; and for outlier and heteroscedastic noise models, which are, to the best of our knowledge, new. These methods are quite effective and extremely fast, with fitting taking minutes if not seconds on a typical 2008 computer.  We also make a contribution to variational methods themselves. Variational approximations often underestimate the variance of posterior densities in Bayesian models (Humphreys &amp; Titterington, 2000; Consonni &amp; Marin, 2004; Wang &amp; Titterington, 2005). We develop grid-based variational posterior approximations. These approximations combine a sequence of variational posterior approximations, can be extremely accurate and are reasonably fast.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiral phosphine synthesis by the application of directed metallation</field><field name="creator">Lin, Qinghong, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ortho metallation of some aromatic ring systems has been investigated in regard to the influence of several types of phosphorus-centred directing groups upon the reactivity, regioselectivity, and utility in later synthetic elaboration. The metallation step allows derivatisation in several useful ways, offering several routes to the synthesis of novel chiral ditertiary phosphines. Thus, an ortho lithiation of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-P-phenylphosphonic diamide (10) led to the interesting primary phosphine, 2-(diphenylphosphino)phenylphosphine (14), after elaboration of the phosphonic diamide directing group. This primary phosphine undergoes an unprecedented facile phenyl group exchange process between its two phosphorus atoms, upon di-lithiation of the primary phosphorus centre. The primary phosphorus centre of (14) has been elaborated in several ways to yield new ditertiary phosphines. The alkylation of this centre in the copper(I) chelate complex has been investigated in several directions. In another direction, (14) has been chemically elaborated to give a new hybrid chiral ditertiary phosphine ligand, &amp;quotSemiPHOS&amp;quot, containing both a chiral phospholane ring and an adjacent diphenylphosphino group. SemiPHOS has been obtained in optically pure forms by a stereoselective synthesis and, independently, by a resolution procedure on its racemate. The molecular design of SemiPHOS was devised such that, when chelated to a metal atom, a subtle steric interaction appears to allow the chirality of the phospholane ring to influence the neighbouring diphenylphosphino group to adopt a complementary chiral conformation. This idea was tested and evaluated by applying SemiPHOS in catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of (Z)-a-(Nacylamino) acrylate substrates to produce the R-amino acid precursors. Aryl species lithiated ortho to phosphorus-centred directing groups were coupled oxidatively by a convenient in situ method, to yield biaryl species that could then be elaborated to give biaryl ditertiary phosphine ligands. This method was used to make several atropisomeric chiral ditertiary phosphines.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphine -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Chirality</field><field name="subject">Ligand field theory</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric synthesis</field><field name="subject">Enantiomers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of offshore gravity from bathymetry</field><field name="creator">Sproule, David, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The definition of the shape of the geoid is a fundamental objective of geodesy, since it allows for the conversion between orthometric and ellipsoidal height systems. The geoid can be computed from gravity values measured over the surface of the earth, and considerable effort continues to achieve a global coverage of gravity values. One technique that has been very successful in recent years in providing gravity coverage in areas which previously have been too difficult to access is airborne gravimetry. This technique has proved very useful in covering near offshore regions, for example. The coastal regions of Australia are recognised as locations where airborne gravimetry has the potential to fill in missing gravity data. A pilot survey using an airborne gravity meter was undertaken off the north east coast of Australia. In areas that remain unsurveyed it is sometimes useful to fill in the missing gravity data values with predicted gravity values. Previous research has examined the possibility of predicting gravity values from other observed quantities. The best success has been achieved by using the gravity effect calculated from bathymetric information. Often the corresponding isostatic compensation is computed, and the combined bathymetric-isostatic gravity effect is used. However, the type and extent of compensation that exists in any particular region mostly remains unknown. Theoretical considerations indicate that the short wavelength part of the gravity field may be adequately modelled by the gravity effect of the bathymetry alone, without reference to an assumed compensation mechanism. With this in mind, a prediction scheme has been developed which utilises the short wavelength gravity field information implied by the bathymetry, combined with the long wavelength gravity field information from existing observed gravity. This scheme allows the prediction of ???fill-in??? gravity values in areas with limited observed gravity. The prediction technique was used on a test set of data off the east coast of Greenland. The prediction technique was seen to outperform a simple interpolation of gravity values by approximately ten percent. Geoid computations performed with the predicted gravity values indicate that the prediction technique can provide significant improvements in computed geoids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication of honeycomb structured porous membranes for biological application</field><field name="creator">Min, Eun Hee , Centre for Advanced Macromolecular Design, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the synthesis of diverse architectures of polymers via the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerisation process that is one of the most novel and versatile controlled polymerisation techniques. Star polymers, comb polymers, amphiphilic block copolymers, and random copolymers were utilised to fabricate porous films with hexagonal arrangement via a ???bottom-up??? engineering approach, namely a ???breath figure??? technique. The quality (i.e. pore regularity and pore size) of the films was optimised by controlling casting variables including humidity, airflow, concentration of polymer solution, polymer architecture, molecular weight of polymer, substrate, and casting volume. Porous membranes were chemically crosslinked to improve their mechanical strength if required. Furthermore, chemical surface modification of porous films was performed by grafting desired polymer (i.e. PNIPAAm or PAGA) via RAFT polymerisation. The RAFT groups present in the films play a role as anchoring sites for polymerisation, thus the complex initiator immobilising can be avoided in our system. The desired polymer grafting is able to enhance wettability and provide binding sites for adhesion and proliferation of cells. The topography of ungrafted and grafted films was analysed using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, confocal microscopy, ATR-FTIR, and XPS.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RAFT polymerisation</field><field name="subject">Breath Figures</field><field name="subject">Honeycomb structured films</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nietzsche's conceptual personae of freedom</field><field name="creator">Brinsmead, Faye Sally, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of a series of encounters with textual figures, or conceptual personae, which are strongly associated with freedom in Nietzsche???s oeuvre. The conceptual persona, drawn from the work of Deleuze and Guattari, is an integral part of the process of developing and articulating philosophical concepts. Nietzsche???s texts abound with figures, both anthropomorphic and otherwise. I suggest that regarding these figures as conceptual personae in the Deleuzo-Guattarian sense offers a way into some of Nietzsche???s most complex ideas. Freedom surely ranks among Nietzsche???s most multifaceted and teasingly elusive ideations. It has not, however, benefited from the intensive scholarship devoted to signature Nietzschean themes such as will to power, nihilism, or eternal return. This thesis seeks to raise the profile of Nietzsche???s innovations on the subject of freedom by means of close readings of texts featuring three conceptual personae of Nietzschean freedom. These are the free spirit, the sovereign individual, and Zarathustra.    These three personae embody freedom as plural and processual. They animate a conception of freedom as something to be striven for, and, indeed, striven for differently by different individuals. Highlighting the infinite variability of embodied freedom, each persona problematises freedom in a distinctly different manner. The free spirit, understood as representing the intersection between freedom and truth, is a primarily epistemological figure. The sovereign individual, who transvaluates bad conscience into good by means of a masterly praxis of promising, instantiates a novel reconstruction of Kantian autonomy as is thus an ethico-political figure. Zarathustra bodies forth an ontology of freedom based on creative willing.   A detailed study of the complex interaction of the three conceptual personae of freedom is beyond the scope of this project. I outline the contours of such a study in the concluding chapter, arguing that the reverberations between the three figures offer a further demonstration, if that were still needed, of the rich originality of Nietzsche???s thought of freedom.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conceptual persona</field><field name="subject">Freedom</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Free spirit</field><field name="subject">Sovereign individual</field><field name="subject">Zarathustra</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44825</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of nanoparticle dispersion, biological interactions and drug incorporation of polyurethane nanocomposite materials</field><field name="creator">Farrugia, Brooke Louise, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of polymer nanocomposites (NCs) in industrial applications has received growing attention over the past decade due to their improved mechanical properties.  However, little work has been reported which analyses the efficacy of NCs in biological applications, including drug delivery systems and implantable materials. This thesis examines the effect of the chemistry of the organic modifier (OM) on the structure and biological performance of poly(ether)urethane NCs (PUNCs) and the influence of the method of drug incorporation on interactions between drug and NC.  Organically modified silicates (OMS) were prepared using OMs varying in terminal functionality and alkyl chain length.  PUNCs were solvent cast containing 1 and 3wt% OMS and particle dispersion analysed using X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.  Findings revealed that use of an OM with methyl terminal, dodecylamine (12CH3), resulted in superior dispersion of OMS compared with a carboxyl terminated OM, aminododecanoic acid (12COOH), of equivalent alkyl chain length.  This is believed to result from increased self interaction of 12COOH compared with 12CH3.  Additionally, increased alkyl chain length was shown to improve NC dispersion with a chain length of sixteen units resulting in the optimum dispersion with a partially exfoliated NC structure.  Analysis of cellular interactions with the PUNCs revealed a significant difference in both fibroblast and platelet adhesion to NCs incorporating 12CH3 compared with 12COOH.  Surface analysis using ToF-SIMS demonstrated the presence of 12CH3 fragments on the NC surface supporting the hypothesis that surface expressed OMs alter cellular interactions with the NC.  Altering the alkyl chain length also affected cellular interaction with an alkyl chain length of twelve units or greater, substantially reducing fibroblast adhesion without affecting cell growth inhibition or viability. Incorporation of a model drug, crystal violet, into the PUNCs demonstrated a lower degree of disruption to OMS dispersion when loaded post NC fabrication compared with pre fabrication.  This is believed to result from interactions between the drug and NC constituents which also impacted on drug release from the NC system.  Results show PUNC properties and biological interactions can be modulated through OM variation and fabrication method, thus showing potential for use in biomedical applications.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biomaterial</field><field name="subject">Polyurethane</field><field name="subject">Nanocomposite</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isoprenoids in Parkinson's disease</field><field name="creator">Ng, Khuen Yen, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Parkinson???s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterised pathologically by the selective death of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and the appearance of abnormal inclusions in some surviving neurons. A body of evidence from epidemiological, in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that isoprenoids, a lipid family which includes cholesterol, dolichol and ubiquinone, may play a role in PD, although to date the data has been conflicting with little consensus regarding the type or direction of change in isoprenoids in PD.  The current study investigated isoprenoids in PD by quantifying a range of isoprenoids in blood sera, brain homogenates and olfactory mucosa derived from PD patients and controls. Further, isoprenoid synthesis pathways were investigated by comparing the activitites and amount of the rate-limiting enzyme for isoprenoid synthesis, HMG CoA reductase, in olfactory mucosal cultures from individuals with sporadic PD and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)-PD with those from healthy individuals.  Serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and dolichol were unchanged in patients with PD compared with controls. Similarly, total tissue cholesterol was unchanged in degenerating and non-degenerating regions of the PD brain, but tissue dolichol was significantly decreased in the substantia nigra in the PD brain, possibly reflecting a change in the neuron/glia ratio in this brain region. In olfactory mucosa, a significant decrease in cellular cholesterol content was identified in patients with LRRK2-PD compared with patients with sporadic PD or controls. The reduction in cholesterol was similar in two different LRRK2 mutations but was not associated with a change in either the amount or activity of HMG CoA reductase.  This study suggests that decreased cholesterol is associated with LRRK2-PD but not with sporadic PD. As cholesterol levels in cells with different LRRK2 mutations were reduced to a similar extent, it is suggested that mutations in this gene result in a loss-of-function of LRRK2 protein. Further it suggests a role for LRRK2 in cholesterol homeostasis independent of HMG-CoA reductase-associated pathways. Recent data has suggested a functional role of LRRK2 in autophagy, a mechanism which may explain the reduction in cholesterol observed in LRRK2-PD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="subject">Isoprenoids</field><field name="subject">LRRK2</field><field name="subject">Olfactory mucosa</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Putting prevention into practice: developing a theoretical model to help understand the lifestyle risk factor management practices of primary health care clinicians</field><field name="creator">Laws, Rachel Angela, Centre for Primary Health Care &amp; Equity, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the effectiveness of brief lifestyle interventions delivered in primary health care (PHC), implementation in routine practice remains suboptimal. Previous research suggests that there are many barriers to PHC clinicians addressing lifestyle risk factors, however few studies have identified the importance of various factors and how they shape practices. This thesis aimed to develop and describe a theoretical model to explain the lifestyle risk factor management practices of PHC clinicians and to identify critical leverage points for intervention. The study analysed data collected as part of a larger feasibility project of risk factor management in three community health teams in NSW, Australia, involving 48 PHC providers working outside of general practice. Grounded theory principles were used to inductively develop a model, involving three main stages of analysis: 1) an initial model was developed based on quantitative analysis of clinician survey and audit data, and qualitative analysis of a purposeful sample of participant interviews (n=18) and journal notes; 2) the model was then refined through additional qualitative analysis of participant interviews (n=30) and journal notes; and 3) the usefulness of the model was examined through a mixed methods and case study analysis. The model suggests that implementation of lifestyle risk factor management reflects clinicians??? beliefs about commitment and capacity. Commitment represents the priority placed on risk factor management and reflects beliefs about role congruence, client receptiveness and the likely impact of intervening. Capacity beliefs reflect clinician views about self efficacy, role support and the fit between risk factor management and ways of working. The model suggests that clinicians formulate different intervention expectations based on these beliefs and their philosophical views about appropriate ways to intervene. These expectations then provide a cognitive framework guiding their risk factor management practices. Finally, clinicians??? appraisal of the overall benefits and costs of addressing lifestyle issues acts to positively reinforce or to diminish their commitment to implementing these practices.  The model extends previous research by outlining a process by which clinicians??? perceptions shape implementation of lifestyle risk factor management in routine practice. This provides new insights to inform the development of effective strategies to improve such practices.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lifestyle risk factors</field><field name="subject">Primary Health Care</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guided random-walk based model checking</field><field name="creator">Bui, Hoai Thang, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ever increasing use of computer systems in society brings emergent challenges to companies and system designers. The reliability of software and hardware can be financially critical, and lives can depend on it. The growth in size and complexity of software, and increasing concurrency, compounds the problem. The potential for errors is greater than ever before, and the stakes are higher than ever before. Formal methods, particularly model checking, is an approach that attempts to prove mathematically that a model of the behaviour of a product is correct with respect to certain properties. Certain errors can therefore be proven never to occur in the model. This approach has tremendous potential in system development to provide guarantees of correctness. Unfortunately, in practice, model checking cannot handle the enormous sizes of the models of real-world systems. The reason is that the approach requires an exhaustive search of the model to be conducted. While there are exceptions, in general model checkers are said not to scale well.  In this thesis, we deal with this scaling issue by using a guiding technique that avoids searching areas of the model, which are unlikely to contain errors. This technique is based on a process of model abstraction in which a new, much smaller model is generated that retains certain important model information but discards the rest. This new model is called a heuristic. While model checking using a heuristic as a guide can be extremely effective, in the worst case (when the guide is of no help), it performs the same as exhaustive search, and hence it also does not scale well in all cases.  A second technique is employed to deal with the scaling issue. This technique is based on the concept of random walks. A random walk is simply a `walk' through the model of the system, carried out by selecting states in the model randomly. Such a walk may encounter an error, or it may not. It is a non-exhaustive technique in the sense that only a manageable number of walks are carried out before the search is terminated. This technique cannot replace the conventional model checking as it can never guarantee the correctness of a model. It can however, be a very useful debugging tool because it scales well. From this point of view, it relieves the system designer from the difficult task of dealing with the problem of size in model checking. Using random walks, the effort goes instead into looking for errors.  The effectiveness of model checking can be greatly enhanced if the above two techniques are combined: a random walk is used to search for errors, but the walk is guided by a heuristic. This in a nutshell is the focus of this work. We should emphasise that the random walk approach uses the same formal model as model checking. Furthermore, the same heuristic technique is used to guide the random walk as a guided model checker. Together, guidance and random walks are shown in this work to result in vastly improved performance over conventional model checking. Verification has been sacrificed of course, but the new technique is able to find errors far more quickly, and deal with much larger models.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heuristic search</field><field name="subject">Model checking</field><field name="subject">Guided random-walk</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative of subtitling strategies: culture specific items in the series Friends</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Han</field><field name="description">The dissertation is based on the analysis of thirty episodes of the American television series Friends with the focus on the CSIs (Culture Specific Items) and how these differences have been handled by Chinese translators who produced the subtitles for the English-Chinese translation. The analysis was based on the assumption that Mainland China&#8217;s culture is different from the US culture so people in these two countries may have problems in understanding CSIs if they are translated literally and if the subtitle translation is not adapted to the target audience. Such adaptation is normally known as localisation. The cultural differences that are ingrained in CSIs might have to be handled with caution in the production of subtitles. The main objective of the dissertation has been to analyse different translation choices which are currently used by the translators in questions, dealing with CSIs where cultural differences between mainland China and the US arise. The research discovered that repetition of CSIs is a strategy which underperformed, failing to help the Chinese audience to comprehend the cultural connotations associated with the CSIs. The paper has provided some recommendations as to how the subtitle translation of such CSIs might be handled in such a way that the audience will have a better understanding of the same.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Subtitling strategies</field><field name="subject">Culture specific items</field><field name="subject">TV series</field><field name="subject">Friends</field><field name="subject">Politeness</field><field name="subject">Face</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NSW public sector accrual accounting: Why did it happen and has it mattered?.</field><field name="creator">Christensen, Mark</field><field name="description">In 1988 the New South Wales (NSW) Government was the first in Australia, and amongst the first in the world, to commit to implement accrual accounting for its General Government Sector. Subsequently, accrual accounting has been implemented by numerous governments, including all Australian governments. This thesis examines why the NSW Government decided to implement accrual accounting and the impact of this accounting change on decision making within a General Government Sector organisation. The historical account is derived from a combination of archival and oral data sources whilst an organisational learning theoretical frame is used in a single-site case study to understand the impact of accrual accounting on managerial decision making. The history of the NSW Government adoption of accrual accounting is characterised by five notable features. First, the whole-of-government initiative was implemented with remarkable speed. Second, the change was aided by the actions of an epistemic community, in which private sector consultants were most active. Third, the change was justified through expected improvements in accountability and management. Fourth, a period of resistance to the change was followed by an absence of critical discussion on the implications of the change as forces supportive of the change synergistically combined. Fifth, the change is explained by mimetic forces that initially coalesced around phantom images, presented by consultants, and subsequently recognised self-interest as an integral part of the change to accrual accounting. The impact of accrual accounting on management decision-making at an organisational level from has been mixed. Information acquisition has expanded in that new sets of accounting data are collected. However, information distribution has been unchanged by accrual accounting whilst information interpretation only marginally changed at a top management level with no discernible change at operational levels. Organisational memory has been altered by accrual accounting in that additional accounting skills and information are now held. However, use of that organisational memory is severely impeded by organisational objectives and constraints that effectively render accrual accounting information irrelevant to public sector managers&#8217; concerns. Policy implications arising from this project are that an alternative model of accrual accounting is required together with the dual recognition that centrally imposed change may produce unpredicted change at an operational agency level and that accounting change needs to be matched to organisational characteristics. Additionally, improvements in asset management, as sought by advocates of accrual accounting, could have been delivered by non-accounting means and there is little prospect for improved managerial decision-making from the current model of accrual accounting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Accrual accounting; Public sector; Accounting history; Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Finance, Public Australia Accounting.</field><field name="subject">Accrual basis accounting Australia.</field><field name="subject">Finance New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Victoria's baby health centres: a history 1917-1950: how did a statewide system of Baby Health Centres grow from the efforts of a small group of concerned women in 1917?</field><field name="creator">Sheard, Heather</field><field name="description">Victoria&#8217;s first Baby Health Centre opened in June 1917 in the inner Melbourne suburb of Richmond.

Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radiotherapy in cancer care: estimating the optimal utilization from a review of evidence-based clinical guidelines.</field><field name="creator">Delaney, Geoffrey, South-west Sydney Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Radiotherapy utilization rates for cancer vary widely internationally. It has previously been suggested that approximately 50% of all cancer patients should receive radiation. However, this estimate was not evidence-based. The aim of this study was to estimate the ideal proportion of new cases of cancer that should receive radiotherapy at least once during the course of their illness based on the best available evidence.  Materials and Methods: An optimal radiotherapy utilization tree was constructed for each cancer based upon indications for radiotherapy taken from evidence-based treatment guidelines. The proportion of patients with clinical attributes that indicated a possible benefit from radiotherapy was obtained by adding epidemiological data to the radiotherapy utilization tree. The optimal proportion of patients with cancer that should receive radiotherapy was then calculated using TreeAge software. Sensitivity analyses using univariate analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.  Results: The proportion of patients with cancer in whom external beam radiotherapy is indicated according to the best available evidence was calculated to be 52%. Monte Carlo analysis indicated that the 95% confidence limits were from 51.7% to 53.1%. The tightness of the confidence interval suggests that the overall estimate is robust. Comparison with actual radiotherapy utilization data suggests a shortfall in actual radiotherapy delivery.  Conclusion: This methodology allows comparison of optimal rates with actual rates to identify areas where improvements in the evidence-based use of radiotherapy can be made. It provides valuable data for radiotherapy service planning. Actual rates need to be addressed to ensure better radiotherapy utilization.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Cancer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing brush: an exploration of Taoist aesthetics</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Yi-Lan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dancing Brush video installation is dedicated to legendary Taiwanese dancer Tsai Jui-Yue (1921-2005) in the memory of her suffering, creativity and faith in life. This work reveals the true meaning of Chinese scroll paintings as an infinity of time and space. It draws on the notion of mobility as expounded in the I Ching or Book of Changes. Dancing Brush creates a modern cityscape where the principal of Taoism, ancient Chinese landscape painting, and calligraphy meet new media aesthetics. The focus of this thesis is to reassess media arts practice and aesthetics via the traditions of Chinese Taoist aesthetics. The research was conducted in three dimensions: ??non-linear aesthetics?? in Chinese arts as the new media art form, ??unity of emptiness and fullness?? as the animation principle, and ??subtraction aesthetics?? as the principle of creativity. I propose Dancing Brush video installation as a presentation of ??aesthetics of wandering contemplation??. The work suggests a feature of Chinese moving image aesthetics as a ??spatial montage?? form of media arts. I applied the Taoist ??decreative-creative process?? as the creative method in which the ??decreative?? process leads to the ??creative??. The ??decreative-creative process?? is based on the Taoist teachings of zi-ran (spontaneity) and wu-wei (non-action). I interpret it as ??subtraction aesthetics: less is more??. The process is to eliminate interferences with restricted narrative format and visual effects, then to receive the immediate presentation of things as pure materials. Through the subtracting process, it gains not less but more. Kong Bai (emptiness or formless) in Chinese art is the result of subtraction aesthetics. It reveals the creative principle derived from the Taoist idea of ??usefulness of useless??. The ??subtracting process?? in creating animation is to bring ??unknown?? to life. The ??image beyond image?? is the product of ??unity of emptiness and full?? where Chinese artistic realm yi-jing is created.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Taoist Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">subtractions aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ignition enhancement for scramjet combustion</field><field name="creator">McGuire, Jeffrey Robert, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The process of shock-induced ignition has been investigated both computa- tionally and experimentally, with particular emphasis on the concept of radical farming. The first component of the investigation contained Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations of an ignition delay study, a 2D pre-mixed flow over flat plate at a constant angle to the freestream, and through a generic 2D scramjet model. The focal point of the investigation however examined the complex 3D flow through a generic scramjet model. Five experimental test conditions were ex- amined over flow enthalpies from 3.4 MJ/kg to 6.4 MJ/kg. All test conditions simulated flight at 21000 metres ([symbol=almost equal to] 70000 ft), while the equivalent flight Mach number varied from approximately 8.5 at the lowest enthalpy, to approximately Mach 12 at the highest enthalpy condition. The presence of H2 fuel injected in the intake caused a separated region to form on the lower surface of the model at the entrance to the combustor. A fraction of the total mass of fuel was entrained in this separated region, providing long residence times, hence increased time for the chemical reactions that lead to ignition to occur. In addition, extremely high temperatures were found to exist between each fuel jet. Both fuel and air are present in these regions, therefore the chance of ignition in these regions is high. Streamlines passing through the recirculation zone ignited within this zone, while streamlines passing between the fuel jets ignited soon after entry into the combustor. The first instance of a pressure rise from combustion was observed on the centreline of the model where the reflected bow shock around the fuel jets crossed the centreline of the combus- tor. Upstream of this location the static pressure of the flow was too low for the chemical reactions that release heat to occur. The comparison between the experimental and computational results was lim- ited due to inaccuracies in modelling the thermal state of the gas in the CFD calculations. The gas was modelled as being in a state of thermal equilibrium at all times, which incorrectly models the freestream flow from the nozzle of the shock tunnel, and also the flow downstream of oblique shock wave within the scramjet model. As a result combustion occurs sooner in the CFD calculations than in the experimental result.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shock-induced ignition</field><field name="subject">2D scramjet model</field><field name="subject">radical farming</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamic (CFD) calculations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian's in Greece and Crete : a study of an intimate wartime relationship</field><field name="creator">Hill, Maria, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Historians have largely ignored the importance of relationships in war, particularly at a grass roots level. Examining the past from a relational point of view provides a new perspective on war not accessible through other forms of analysis. A relational approach to a study of the campaigns in Greece and Crete helps to explain, amongst other issues, why so many Australian lives were saved.  Australians entered Greece with little background knowledge of the country and the people they were required to defend. There was no serious consultation with the Australian government apart from the cursory briefing of its Prime Minister. Although Britain had numerous intelligence officers operating on the ground in Greece prior and during the campaign, little information about the true political situation in the country had filtered through to the Australian high command. This placed the troops in a very vulnerable position on the Greek frontier and, later, on Crete.  Military interaction with the Greeks proved difficult, as key officers from the Greek General Staff and senior government ministers did not intend to fight the Germans. As a result, little coordination took place between the Australian and Greek forces hindering the development of a successful working relationship. Conversely, relations with the Greek people were very amicable with many Greeks risking their lives to help Australian troops.  The altruism of the Greeks was one of the most striking features of the Greek and Crete campaigns. Unlike Egypt, where the Australians felt alienated by the values and customs of the Egyptian people, in Greece they warmed to the behaviour of the Greeks. Although they did not speak the same language nor share a similar culture, they had many characteristics in common with the Greeks whose strong sense of loyalty to their allies really impressed the Australians. On their part, the Australians displayed respect for the values and customs of the Greek people.  Through their interaction during the war, the Greeks came to regard the Australians, not only as friends, but also as brothers, forging an intimate relationship that has been incorporated in the social memory of both countries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian and Greece : Foreign Relations</field><field name="subject">World War, 1939-1945 : Campaigns : Greece</field><field name="subject">Australia and Greece :  Military Relations</field><field name="subject">Australian Army : Serving in Greece</field><field name="subject">Australian politics 1941-1945..</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On semiparametric regression and data mining</field><field name="creator">Ormerod, John T, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Semiparametric regression is playing an increasingly large role in the analysis of datasets exhibiting various complications (Ruppert, Wand &amp; Carroll, 2003). In particular semiparametric regression a plays prominent role in the area of data mining where such complications are numerous (Hastie, Tibshirani &amp; Friedman, 2001). In this thesis we develop fast, interpretable methods addressing many of the difficulties associated with data mining applications including: model selection, missing value analysis, outliers and heteroscedastic noise.  We focus on function estimation using penalised splines via mixed model methodology (Wahba 1990; Speed 1991; Ruppert et al. 2003). In dealing with the difficulties associated with data mining applications many of the models we consider deviate from typical normality assumptions. These models lead to likelihoods involving analytically intractable integrals. Thus, in keeping with the aim of speed, we seek analytic approximations to such integrals which are typically faster than numeric alternatives.  These analytic approximations not only include popular penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) approximations (Breslow &amp; Clayton, 1993) but variational approximations. Originating in physics, variational approximations are a relatively new class of approximations (to statistics) which are simple, fast, flexible and effective. They have recently been applied to statistical problems in machine learning where they are rapidly gaining popularity (Jordan, Ghahramani, Jaakkola &amp; Sau11999; Corduneanu &amp; Bishop, 2001; Ueda &amp; Ghahramani, 2002; Bishop &amp; Winn, 2003; Winn &amp; Bishop 2005).  We develop variational approximations to: generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs); Bayesian GLMMs; simple missing values models; and for outlier and heteroscedastic noise models, which are, to the best of our knowledge, new. These methods are quite effective and extremely fast, with fitting taking minutes if not seconds on a typical 2008 computer.  We also make a contribution to variational methods themselves. Variational approximations often underestimate the variance of posterior densities in Bayesian models (Humphreys &amp; Titterington, 2000; Consonni &amp; Marin, 2004; Wang &amp; Titterington, 2005). We develop grid-based variational posterior approximations. These approximations combine a sequence of variational posterior approximations, can be extremely accurate and are reasonably fast.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data mining</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chiral phosphine synthesis by the application of directed metallation</field><field name="creator">Lin, Qinghong, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ortho metallation of some aromatic ring systems has been investigated in regard to the influence of several types of phosphorus-centred directing groups upon the reactivity, regioselectivity, and utility in later synthetic elaboration. The metallation step allows derivatisation in several useful ways, offering several routes to the synthesis of novel chiral ditertiary phosphines. Thus, an ortho lithiation of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-P-phenylphosphonic diamide (10) led to the interesting primary phosphine, 2-(diphenylphosphino)phenylphosphine (14), after elaboration of the phosphonic diamide directing group. This primary phosphine undergoes an unprecedented facile phenyl group exchange process between its two phosphorus atoms, upon di-lithiation of the primary phosphorus centre. The primary phosphorus centre of (14) has been elaborated in several ways to yield new ditertiary phosphines. The alkylation of this centre in the copper(I) chelate complex has been investigated in several directions. In another direction, (14) has been chemically elaborated to give a new hybrid chiral ditertiary phosphine ligand, &amp;quotSemiPHOS&amp;quot, containing both a chiral phospholane ring and an adjacent diphenylphosphino group. SemiPHOS has been obtained in optically pure forms by a stereoselective synthesis and, independently, by a resolution procedure on its racemate. The molecular design of SemiPHOS was devised such that, when chelated to a metal atom, a subtle steric interaction appears to allow the chirality of the phospholane ring to influence the neighbouring diphenylphosphino group to adopt a complementary chiral conformation. This idea was tested and evaluated by applying SemiPHOS in catalytic asymmetric hydrogenations of (Z)-a-(Nacylamino) acrylate substrates to produce the R-amino acid precursors. Aryl species lithiated ortho to phosphorus-centred directing groups were coupled oxidatively by a convenient in situ method, to yield biaryl species that could then be elaborated to give biaryl ditertiary phosphine ligands. This method was used to make several atropisomeric chiral ditertiary phosphines.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphine -- Synthesis</field><field name="subject">Chirality</field><field name="subject">Ligand field theory</field><field name="subject">Asymmetric synthesis</field><field name="subject">Enantiomers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">N-acylhomoserine lactone regulation of adhesion and biofilm differentiation in Serratia marcescens MG1</field><field name="creator">Labbate, Maurizio, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen involved in predominantly nosocomial infections, however, it is also implicated as a common cause of microbial keratitis.  Since many S. marcecens strains are also resistant to multiple antibiotics, this organism represents a growing public health problem.  S. marcescens MG1 utilises a regulatory system for regulation of swarming motility and exo-enzyme secretion that relies on the production of a diffusible signal identified as N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL).  The aim of this study was to determine the role of C4-HSL in surface colonisation (adhesion and biofilm formation).  In this thesis, the development of a novel biofilm in S. marcescens MG1 is described.  The biofilm comprises of an intricate and complex structure consisting of long filamentous cells, cell aggregates and cell chains.  Two C4-HSL controlled genes (bsmA and bsmB) are shown to be crucial for biofilm formation.  It is proposed that C4-HSL regulated bsmA and bsmB gene products are engaged in fine tuning aggregation at a specific time point in late biofilm development.  Since adhesion is the first stage of colonisation, the role of C4-HSL in adhesion to a hydrophilic abiotic surface (HAS) and a human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line was assessed.  While adhesion to the HAS was found to be C4-HSL controlled, this was not the case for adhesion to the HCE cells.  In adhesion to the HAS, mutations in the following C4-HSL regulated genes resulted in reduced adhesion; a sensor kinase gene (rssA), a type I transporter gene (lipB), bsmA and bsmB.  These four genes were found to effect the expression of type I fimbriae which is proposed to be the adhesin affecting C4-HSL regulated adhesion.  While C4-HSL is not involved in adhesion to the HCE cell line, the genes bsmA and bsmB are important.  It is proposed that bsmA and bsmB dependent HCE adhesion is due to the requirement of these genes for type I fimbriae production.  Furthermore, C4-HSL was found to regulate capsule polysaccharide and OmpX production and repress cytotoxic activity against HCE cells and erythrocytes. It is proposed that cytotoxicity is mediated by ShlA haemolysin.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Serratia marcescens</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coal bed methane reservoir simulation studies</field><field name="creator">Karimi, Kaveh, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to perform simulation studies for a specific coal bed methane reservoir. First, the theory and reservoir engineering aspects of coal bed methane reservoirs, such as dual porosity concept, permeability characteristics of CBM reservoirs and mechanism of gas storage and gas transportation in CBM reservoir have been discussed. Next, simulation results for the CBM reservoir presented. Simulation studies were carried out by using the CBM reservoir simulator, SIMED II. Injection/fall-off test pressure data were interpreted based on the pressure history matching method. The interpretation results include the determination of reservoir permeability and identification of the reservoir altered zone. Also available production histories were used to simulate the reservoir production behavior. Then the production model was used to predict the reservoir future production and to carry out sensitivity analysis on reservoir performance. For natural pressure depletion, methane recovery was increased significantly as reservoir permeability was increased. Well-bore fracturing creates a fractured zone with higher permeability. This increases methane production rate during early time of reservoir life. Reservoir matrix porosity has a significant effect on the reservoir performance. Higher production peak rate and also higher methane recovery was obtained for the reservoir with lower porosity values. Any increase in the reservoir compressibility causes greater reduction in reservoir absolute permeability as well as relative permeability to gas throughout the reservoir. Therefore, methane recovery decreased as the reservoir compressibility increased. The reservoir production behavior was strongly affected by changes in reservoir size. The production peak rate was significantly postponed and lowered as reservoir size was increased. The effect of reservoir initial pressure was investigated and the results show that higher initial reservoir pressure leads to higher production rate during early years of production. However, for the later years of reservoir life, the production profile is almost identical for different initial pressures. Coal desorption time constant affects the methane production by its own scale. In this study, the range of desorption time did not exceed longer than three days and therefore the difference in production rate was observed only in the first few days of production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coalbed methane</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion. The findings from this thesis provide insights on tacit collusion in an oligopoly and policy implications from a learning perspective. With modelling flexibility, our co-evolutionary approach can be extended to study strategic behaviour in an oligopoly considering many other market characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Price fixing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Finance -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Oligopolies -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of offshore gravity from bathymetry</field><field name="creator">Sproule, David, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The definition of the shape of the geoid is a fundamental objective of geodesy, since it allows for the conversion between orthometric and ellipsoidal height systems. The geoid can be computed from gravity values measured over the surface of the earth, and considerable effort continues to achieve a global coverage of gravity values. One technique that has been very successful in recent years in providing gravity coverage in areas which previously have been too difficult to access is airborne gravimetry. This technique has proved very useful in covering near offshore regions, for example. The coastal regions of Australia are recognised as locations where airborne gravimetry has the potential to fill in missing gravity data. A pilot survey using an airborne gravity meter was undertaken off the north east coast of Australia. In areas that remain unsurveyed it is sometimes useful to fill in the missing gravity data values with predicted gravity values. Previous research has examined the possibility of predicting gravity values from other observed quantities. The best success has been achieved by using the gravity effect calculated from bathymetric information. Often the corresponding isostatic compensation is computed, and the combined bathymetric-isostatic gravity effect is used. However, the type and extent of compensation that exists in any particular region mostly remains unknown. Theoretical considerations indicate that the short wavelength part of the gravity field may be adequately modelled by the gravity effect of the bathymetry alone, without reference to an assumed compensation mechanism. With this in mind, a prediction scheme has been developed which utilises the short wavelength gravity field information implied by the bathymetry, combined with the long wavelength gravity field information from existing observed gravity. This scheme allows the prediction of ???fill-in??? gravity values in areas with limited observed gravity. The prediction technique was used on a test set of data off the east coast of Greenland. The prediction technique was seen to outperform a simple interpolation of gravity values by approximately ten percent. Geoid computations performed with the predicted gravity values indicate that the prediction technique can provide significant improvements in computed geoids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Struggling against the silences: exploring rights based responses to the rape and sexual abuse of refugee women and girls</field><field name="creator">Bartolomei, Linda Albina, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the widespread occurrence of rape of women and girls in conflict and refugee settings. It contains many horrendous and complex case studies of rape and sexual violence. Using an intersectional framework, a range of theories is used to analyse these and in doing so the compounding effects of rape and sexual abuse in conflict and refugee situations is identified. The study uses a feminist action research methodology, involving seven complex cycles. These involve field work in Kenya and Thailand and are informed by the theoretical frameworks of post-colonial feminism, critical and anti-oppressive social work, and human rights. The study explores the silences surrounding rape and the reasons why major advances in international law and policy have had such little impact. It begins with an examination of the systematic use of rape as a strategy of war and the ways in which this is addressed in law, policy and practice. It then examines the impact and sequelae of rape on refugee women and girls. This focuses on exploring the reasons for the continued failure of the Women at Risk (WaR) Program to fulfil its potential. An extensive range of risk factors is explored. The almost complete failure of measures to protect refugee women and girls is documented. During the field work, a new research methodology which draws on community development and human rights principles is developed to ensure that the voices and agency of refugee women and girls are included. The study examines the lack of viable risk identification and response mechanisms and critiques the frequent failure to actively involve refugee women in finding and implementing solutions. It also identifies a number of political and ideological barriers, including the damaging impact of negative staff attitudes and the continued characterisation of refugee women as universally vulnerable and oppressed by their cultural contexts. In an activist approach to theory and practice, the study draws on a range of theories to understand the problems and to inform advocacy for changes in policy and practice. These include the development of new tools, law and policy informed by anti-oppressive participatory rights based approaches.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human Rights</field><field name="subject">Refugee Women</field><field name="subject">Rape and Sexual Violence</field><field name="subject">Social Work</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kaleidoscopic natural theology: the dynamics of natural theological discourse in seventeenth and early eighteenth-century England</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Larissa Kate, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, there was a close connection between natural philosophy and theology. However, this connection was neither essential nor intrinsic, but was open to discussion and negotiation, and natural theology played an important role in these negotiations. While there is already a great deal of literature concerned with natural theology from two distinct academic disciplines???history of science and history of religion???neither set of literature has adequately grasped the nature of the tradition, leading to conflicting claims about its historical origin. In addition, the close connection between natural and revealed theology evident in the works of orthodox Christians in early modern England has been frequently overlooked. This thesis, then, is a contribution to discussions of the relations between theology and natural philosophy in early modern England. Its main purpose is to develop and test a theoretical model of natural theology, designed to overcome some of the limitations of existing approaches. According to this model, a tradition of natural theology only emerged in England in the seventeenth century, due to the theological and natural philosophical turmoil of the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution, although it was not without precedents. This tradition of natural theology was apologetically focused, providing arguments in favour of religious doctrines originally derived from revelation. Natural theology was a dynamic discourse, which may be represented by the metaphor of a kaleidoscope, in which resources chosen from natural philosophy and theology were combined and refracted according to the pre-existing views of the practitioner as well as the contextual challenges to which he was responding. By employing a variety of resources from both natural philosophy and theology, natural theology could function as a kind of mediator between these two neighbouring traditions. This model will be tested against a range of historical case studies that represent the moments in the historical trajectory of natural theology at which output of the discourse became more concentrated, due to renewed upheaval within and between theology and natural philosophy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Science and religion</field><field name="subject">Natural theology</field><field name="subject">Natural philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, construction and control of an industrial scale biped robot</field><field name="creator">Cronin, Joe, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A 500Kg, self-contained biped robot, named Roboshift, has been conceived and tested to investigate issues associated with the control of industrial scale biped robots. This project represents the first credible attempt to build a heavy weight autonomous biped robot. The recent expansion in humanoid robot development has highlighted advances made in anthropomorphic biped technology. Current research into speech recognition, vision systems, laser topography, artificial intelligence and electroactive polymers will ultimately achieve an Android capable of human like actions and thought processes. Justification for this most demanding and expensive research is based on philanthropic models that suggest these robots will attend to the bedridden, or replace humans in dangerous areas. However, the cost of a biped robot when compared to that of a wheeled or tracked vehicle restricts commercialisation for these applications. As well, the size and working capacity of current humanoid robots is not compatible with the heavy lifting requirements found in such environments. It is proposed that only biped robots of an industrial scale, possessing a capacity much greater than that of a human, will be of commercial value in the future. Typical applications may include the handling of materials in confined or uneven terrain, where a forklift or other commercially available materials handling equipment would be unsuitable. For example, field handling in military, mining or geological environments. Minimal research has been conducted into the realisation of such a device, which presents challenges in terms of the magnitude of dynamic forces produced and of the systems required to control the robot in real-time. Review of relevant literature reveals that little research has been completed in this field. Therefore, operational characteristics for an industrial scale biped robot are defined. The design then details the structure and integration of mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems. Roboshift is powered by an internal combustion engine and is the first biped robot with a capacity for extended operation. Modelling was conducted to determine joint trajectories, power requirements, hydraulic flow parameters and dynamic characteristics. The robot is controlled by a distributed, hierarchical system comprising sixteen microprocessors, a control computer acting as the midbrain and a communications computer acting as the central nervous system. Sensors measure attitude and heading (vestibular system) as well as ground reaction forces and joint angles (propreoception). The control strategy is based on feed forward trajectories generated by inverse kinematic analysis. Corrections to trajectories are made in real time by higher level routines running on the main control computer. Joint position is achieved by local feedback control. Software for the robot was written in the C language. Experimental results are presented detailing the performance of the robot in comparison to theoretical analysis. After construction and testing of actuators and sensors, calibration software was tested successfully. Once calibrated, the robot was lowered to the ground where the active balance software was able to control the robot in the frontal and sagittal planes. Frontal sway software was tested with mixed success as natural oscillation of the structure, which was not detectable by the control system, led to erroneous force data. Detailed dynamic modelling was then completed to determine the causes of oscillation in the robot. The modelling led to the formulation of a control strategy where non-collocated sensors are used to measure link strain as a feedback to a modified proportional controller. The project has demonstrated that an industrial scale biped incorporating an internal combustion engine and hydraulic power system is feasible.. Analysis presented proposes that as the height of a biped robot increases, the expected elastic deformation of the structure increases as the cube of the height, making control extremely challenging. A strategy for the control of heavy-weight robots is suggested It is also proposed that technology incorporated in current humanoid robots can not be scaled to control industrial bipeds.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Just a small window to get some leverage : A critical examination of the rise of Te Wananga o Aotearoa with particular emphasis on the role of the State in the battle for control of this Maori tertiary educational institution</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Bruce</field><field name="description">The 17 July 1863 saw a British military force led by Major General Cameron, with Crimean War experience, invade the Waikato of Aotearoa New Zealand, and essentially ending for Waikato Maori on 2 April 1864 at Orakau when Cameron with 1,200 troops, defeated a group of 300 Maori that included representatives of at least nine iwi, and women and children, led by Rewi Maniapoto.In December 1863, well before the events of Orakau, the New Zealand Settlements Act of 1863 (NZSA) was passed into law. This Act&#8217;s only purpose was to confiscate 1,408,400 hectares of land from Maori; 486,500 hectares from Waikato Maori, of whom Ngati Maniapoto are an important part. The Act deprived Maori of their traditional lands and the means to participate in the economy, with serious social and economic consequences for them well into the 20th century.In 1993, tertiary educational status was granted to what was essentially an initiative of the people of Ngati Maniapoto that began in 1983 to provide educational alternatives to young people, predominately Maori. This initiative became Te Wananga o Aotearoa (TWOA). Over a period of six years from 1998, TWOA moved from being an insignificant tertiary educational institution to the largest in the country in terms of student and equivalent full time student numbers. By mid 2005, TWOA was under the control of the State, the first time such a situation had occurred in this country, and completely contrary to the independence provisions that the Education Act 1989 bestows on tertiary educational institutions.This thesis is an examination of the State&#8217;s battle for control of TWOA, to consider likely reasons why the State sought this control, and the tactics used by the State to achieve this outcome.The thesis examines the part that knowledge and access to education plays in global economics in the late 20th and early 21st century, and will consider whether knowledge and access to education was as economically important to individuals in these times, as land was in 1863.The fact that TWOA&#8217;s success was achieved completely within the parameters of the tertiary education policies of both successive Governments since 1998 was irrelevant to the NZ Labour Party led Government of 2005. They appeared to set out on a predetermined path to gain control, in order to neutralise TWOA&#8217;s growth and to then reshape the sector to ensure that such success did not happen again. The conclusion is that what was seen as a just a small &#8216;window&#8217; to get some leverage, was thrown open, and very powerful levers then used, to achieve this end.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indigenous education</field><field name="subject">colonisation</field><field name="subject">capitalism</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand politics</field><field name="subject">abuse of power</field><field name="subject">land</field><field name="subject">knowledge</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">NZ National Party</field><field name="subject">NZ Labour Party</field><field name="subject">access to eduction</field><field name="subject">racism</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explaining and predicting rural turnover intentions and behaviours in Charleville, Australia</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Jennifer Adele</field><field name="description">Attracting and retaining employees has emerged as one of the most important issues currently challenging organizations worldwide, and in the rural setting it has become a genuine concern for public and private sectors.  Longstanding research into turnover has historically been rather piecemeal, for example attrition and retention research has focused on employment conditions such as pay or supervision (Richards et al. 1994; Dinham &amp; Scott 1996; Dodd-McCue and Wright 1996; Rahim 1996; Scott et al. 1998; Cheney et al. 2004; Robinson &amp; Pillemer 2007; Gow et al 2008; Newton 2008) or personal factors such as personality (Deary, Watson &amp; Hogston 2003; Bakker 2006).  This research study adopted a multi-focus or ecological perspective and provided a holistic understanding of employee turnover, something that has been lacking from much of the previous literature. This thesis evaluated turnover intentions and behaviours, through investigating personal, work and community variables with a group of rural public service employees in Charleville, South West Queensland, Australia.  The purpose of this study was to examine the factors that influenced a rural government workers decision to stay in or leave their job, and could these predict turnover.  It has implications for organizations and workforce management in rural settings but some parts may be applied to the urban context.Eighty-nine workers from 12 state government departments were studied in 2003 and 2004.  Eight variables were researched including professional, personal and community factors, job satisfaction, stress, social support, organizational commitment, intent to remain and actual turnover behaviour.  The research methods used were surveys, interviews and observations.  A descriptive picture of the sample was formed using some of the data in the survey.  The rest of the survey data was analysed using regression analysis.  This information was then used as the basis for the interviews.  This data along with the observation data were analysed qualitatively.The two main hypotheses for this study were, 1) personal, professional and community variables influence employee turnover, and 2) that it was possible to predict turnover from these three variables.  Consequently, the primary research questions were &#8216;can we explain employee turnover intentions and behaviours by evaluating personal, professional and community variables?&#8217; and &#8216;Can these factors be used to predict turnover?&#8217;  The results of this study support both hypotheses.  It was found that personal, professional and community factors did influence rural government worker turnover; and that turnover can be predicted.  Furthermore, that intent can be used as a predictor of turnover.  It argues that employee turnover is a complex process involving personal, professional, community, stress, job satisfaction, social support, commitment and intent variables.  This study identifies the factors that influence actual and intended rural government employee turnover and gives organizations a platform for operationalizing effective retention programs.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">retention</field><field name="subject">attrition</field><field name="subject">turnover</field><field name="subject">staff</field><field name="subject">job satisfaction</field><field name="subject">organisational commitment</field><field name="subject">social support</field><field name="subject">rural</field><field name="subject">government employees</field><field name="subject">predicting</field><field name="subject">demographics</field><field name="subject">professional development</field><field name="subject">supervisor</field><field name="subject">promotional opportunities</field><field name="subject">holistic approach</field><field name="subject">personal factors</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">turnover intentions</field><field name="subject">Business</field><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an Ecologically Sustainable Catholic Primary School</field><field name="creator">Hindmarsh, Patricia</field><field name="description">The research intention is to identify the characteristics of an ecologically sustainable contemporary Catholic primary school and the conditions that support the development of such a school community. The literature review showed there is a clear mandate from the Catholic Church to consider ecological conversion as integral to its evangelising mission, a mission that is at the heart of Catholic education, including the school. An extensive body of educational literature, including philosophy of education and curriculum frameworks, identified environmental awareness and responsibility as mandatory outcomes for all students. The literature study defined and described ecological conversion, sustainable education, environmental education and related conceptual understandings. The literature study also provided examples of strategies to guide the strategic implementation of these understandings within the total learning program of a school. From examples found in the literature, a framework, Steps in Becoming an Environmentally Active Catholic Primary School, incorporating the specifically Catholic religious dimension, was developed by the researcher to provide benchmarks and indicators against which a school&#8217;s progress in journeying towards ecological sustainability could be evaluated. This qualitative, constructionist study incorporated some elements of Grounded Theory in gathering and analysing data from within two Australian Catholic primary case study schools recognised for their commitment and good practice in sustainable education. From the analysis of the data gathered through interviews, focus groups and participant observation, the distinctive characteristics of the two schools were identified and their stage of development evaluated against the framework Steps in Becoming an Environmentally Active Catholic Primary School. In addition, the factors that had supported school development and the factors that were barriers to that development were named.

Due to the difficulties and high cost in recovering high quality samples from deepwater site, there is increasing reliance on in situ tests such as piezocone and full-flow (i.e. T-bar and ball) penetration tests for determining the geotechnical design parameters. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute (NGI), as part of a joint industry project, to improve the reliability of in situ tests in determining design parameters and to improve offshore site investigation practice in deepwater soft sediments. In this research, a worldwide high quality database was assembled and used to correlate intact and remoulded shear strengths (measured from laboratory and vane shear tests) with penetration resistances measured by piezocone, T-bar and ball penetrometers. The overall statistics showed similar and low levels of variability of resistance factors for intact shear strength (N-factors) for all three types of penetrometer. In the correlation between the remoulded penetration resistance and remoulded shear strength, the resistance factors for remoulded shear strength (Nrem-factors) were found higher than the N-factors. As a result, the resistance sensitivity is less than the strength sensitivity. The correlations between the derived N-factors and specific soil characteristics indicated that the piezocone N-factors are more influenced by rigidity index than those for the T-bar and ball penetrometers. The effect of strength anisotropy is only apparent in respect of N-factors for the T-bar and ball penetrometers correlated to shear strengths measured in triaxial compression. On the other hand, the Nrem-factors showed slight tendency to increase with increasing strength sensitivity but were insensitive to soil index properties. These findings suggest that the full-flow penetrometers may be used to estimate remoulded shear strength and are potentially prove more reliable than the piezocone in estimating average or vane shear strength for intact soil but the reverse is probably true for the estimation of triaxial compression strength.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clay soils -- Penetration resistance</field><field name="subject">Clay soils -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Penetrometer</field><field name="subject">Shear strength of soils -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Soil penetration test</field><field name="subject">Strains and stresses</field><field name="subject">Shear strength</field><field name="subject">Consolidation</field><field name="subject">In situ testing</field><field name="subject">Deepwater site investigation</field><field name="subject">Strain rate effects</field><field name="subject">Clays</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0008</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vitamin D, neuromuscular control and falling episodes in Australian postmenopausal women</field><field name="creator">Austin, Nicole</field><field name="description">Falls in the older population have devastating consequences on the psychological and physiological health of the individual. Due to the complexity of interacting factors associated with ageing, pathology and falling episodes, determination of a primary cause or set of causes has been difficult to establish. Deficits in components of neuromuscular control have been widely studied with the coordinated interaction of sensory and motor system components being presented as a fundamental factor in the reduction of falling episodes. A causal relationship between deficits in vitamin D status and falling episodes has also been suggested. Furthermore, a relationship between poor vitamin D status, falling episodes and poor neuromuscular performance has been reported. The aims of the current study were designed to advance understanding in three aspects of the problem of falls prevention. Firstly an examination of the reliability of testing procedures commonly used in assessment of falls risk was undertaken. The Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) testing procedure was selected as a commonly used tool and the reliability of its various components (sensory, motor and balance) was undertaken as an independent assessment of this approach to assessing falls propensity. Secondly, a case control study of fallers and non fallers was undertaken in which the neuromuscular tests evaluated in the reliability study were used to assess differences in neuromuscular control. The influence of vitamin D status on these measures was also considered. Thirdly, a 12-month randomised controlled trial of vitamin D/calcium supplementation or placebo/calcium was undertaken to identify the effect on falls outcome and individual measures of neuromuscular control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Menopause -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Motor ability -- Physiological aspects</field><field name="subject">Muscular sense</field><field name="subject">Older women -- Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Vitamin D -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Vitamin D -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Falls</field><field name="subject">Neuromuscular</field><field name="subject">Vitamin D</field><field name="subject">Elderly</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Voice and verb morphology in Minangkabau, a language of West Sumatra, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Crouch, Sophie Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Minangkabau is an Austronesian, Indonesian-type language spoken in West Sumatra by approximately seven million speakers. Despite its large number of speakers and the spread of Minangkabau people throughout the Indonesian Archipelago, Minangkabau remains under-described when compared to other Indonesian-type languages like Javanese. This study seeks to improve current understanding about Minangkabau by describing its system of voice alternations and verb morphology. This study presents a novel analysis of the forms and functions of voice marking in Minangkabau, incorporating naturalistic data into the analysis as well as taking the findings of recent typological and theoretical studies of Austronesian languages into consideration. The study makes use of naturalistic, conversational and narrative data from a database maintained by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Field Station in Padang. The study also makes use of elicited data collected in Perth and during fieldwork in Padang. Naturalistic and more formal, elicited Minangkabau data reveals different kinds of linguistic patterns, therefore this study makes a distinction between Colloquial Minangkabau and Standard Minangkabau. The study concludes that Minangkabau has a pragmatically motivated voice system encoded by the alternation between active voice, passive voice and the pasif semu construction. In addition, the study concludes that Minangkabau also has a conceptually motivated voice system that is encoded by a series of semantic and lexical/derivational affixes (ta-, pa-, and ba-) which show how the action originates and develops. The Minangkabau applicatives -an and -i are for the most part valency changing devices but operate within both the pragmatic and conceptual domains of Minangkabau voice. The active voice marker maN- also operates in both pragmatic and conceptual domains whereas the use of the passive voice marker di- is primarily motivated by pragmatic and syntactic factors. This analysis is supported by the finding that di- is a morphosyntactic clitic whereas the conceptual voice markers are affixes and have mainly lexico-semantic properties.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Minangkabau (Indonesian people) -- Languages</field><field name="subject">Minangkabau language -- Morphology</field><field name="subject">Minangkabau language -- Verb</field><field name="subject">Sumatera Barat (Indonesia) -- Languages</field><field name="subject">Minangkabau</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Voice</field><field name="subject">Verb morphology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and maintenance of cognitive and behavioural eating disorder symptoms</field><field name="creator">Allen, Karina</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Eating disorders affect a significant proportion of adolescent and young adult women and a smaller proportion of children, men, and older individuals. They are associated with a range of physical, psychological, and social consequences that can have a profound and lasting impact on affected individuals. Eating disorder symptoms (e.g., marked weight and shape concern, strict dieting, binge eating, purging) are also associated with physiological and psychosocial morbidity, and are reported by up to half of adolescent girls and one-third of adolescent boys. If eating disorders are to be effectively prevented or treated, it is imperative that risk and maintaining factors for the conditions are identified.  ... This thesis aimed to identify the variables and models that may best account for the development and maintenance of eating disorder symptoms, through two broad studies and six sub-studies. Study 1 focused on identifying predictors of cognitive (i.e., elevated weight and shape concern) and behavioural (i.e., binge eating) eating disorder symptoms in pre- to early-adolescent children followed over time. Prospective tests of the dual-pathway (Stice, 2001) and cognitive-behavioural (Fairburn, 2002; Fairburn, Cooper, &amp; Shafran, 2003) models of eating pathology were also conducted, and a distinction was made between weight and shape concern and weight and shape over-evaluation. Low selfesteem, perceived media pressure to be thin, weight and shape over-evaluation, and maternal concern about child weight prospectively predicted increases in child weight and shape concern over time (Studies 1b and 1c), and weight and shape concern was the most robust predictor of increases in dietary restraint (Studies 1b and 1d). Dietary restraint and affect-related eating prospectively predicted binge eating onset (Studies 1a and 1d), and the dual-pathway and cognitive-behavioural models were both able to account for the development of binge eating over a two year period (Study 1d). Evidence was also provided for the relative superiority of the most recent, enhanced cognitivebehavioural model (Fairburn et al., 2003) over other available theoretical accounts. Study 2 focused more specifically on the role of mood intolerance in predicting and maintaining eating pathology in adults. In Study 2a, a new measure of mood intolerance was developed, revised, and evaluated. In Study 2b, the role of mood intolerance in cross-sectionally predicting binge eating and purging was examined within the framework of the enhanced cognitive-behavioural model. The importance of mood intolerance in accounting for eating disorder symptoms was confirmed, and additional support for the cognitive-behavioural model was provided. Collectively, the six empirical studies have provided new data regarding the relative importance of different variables in the development and maintenance of different eating disorder symptoms. They also provide initial insight into the relative validity of alternate theoretical models in this area. The results suggest that the most recent, enhanced cognitive-behavioural model may provide the best account of how eating disorder symptoms develop and are maintained, providing that the mood intolerance component of the model is specified.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Eating disorders -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Eating disorders</field><field name="subject">Disordered eating</field><field name="subject">Binge eating</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of language exposure on fluency in simultaneous interpreting</field><field name="creator">Kapranov, Oleksandr</field><field name="description">Five experiments are presented in this thesis. They investigate the impact of the interpreter's language exposure on the interpreter's fluency in simultaneous interpreting. The measurement of the interpreter's fluency involves a quantitative procedure developed by Kirsner and his colleagues (2002). The procedure is based on computer-assisted analyses of pause and speech segment durations and associated variables. The quantitative measures are employed to determine whether or not different levels of the language exposure influence fluency in simultaneous interpreting. The impact of the interpreter's language exposure is elaborated upon within the framework of dynamic systems theory. Experiment 1 is a pilot case study investigating the applicability of the methodology developed by Kirsner and his colleagues (2002, 2005) to the research in fluency in simultaneous interpreting. In Experiments 2-5 this methodology is extended to investigate the impact of the participants' language exposure on fluency in simultaneous interpreting involving various language pair combinations. Experiment 2 investigates the interpreter students' exposure to their third working language, Norwegian. It has been found that the participant's fluency in the experimental tasks critically depends on the amount of out-of-classroom language exposure, involving the language exposure to Swedish, a language typologically closely related to Norwegian. Experiment 3 investigates the impact of the interpreter students' language exposure gained during the stay abroad in Germany on their fluency in interpretation from/into German. Significant gains in fluency due to the stay abroad have been found between the groups of participants and their respective controls who studied German at their respective home universities. Experiments 4 and 5 explore the impact of the on-going language exposure to the interpreter's second language in the conditions of discontinuity in practicing simultaneous interpreting. The participants with the language pair combinations Finnish/Swedish (experiment 4) and English/Russian (experiment 5) have discontinued practicing simultaneous interpreting, yet enjoy a continuous exposure to their working languages. The participants have exhibited superior fluency measures compared to their respective controls (beginner and advanced students), and inferior fluency measures compared to the control group of professional interpreters. Data analysis of all the participants under all experimental conditions have not yielded any pause duration distributions specific to simultaneous interpreting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Simultaneous interpreting</field><field name="subject">Fluency (Language learning)</field><field name="subject">Fluency</field><field name="subject">Interpreting</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of marriage among Malays</field><field name="creator">Abd Manaf, Abdul Razak</field><field name="description">Existing literature and much of the research on marriage and family experiences have been largely and commonly problem-based and deficit-oriented. Even though some strength-focused approaches to the study of marriages and families have been undertaken and have gained momentum there is still much empirical work needed in order for us to understand the complexity and intricacies of what constitutes a quality marital relationship.   In this qualitative research study, I analysed how quality of marriage is conceptualised and understood by Malays within a Malaysian context. I undertook the research in order to capture and understand how a cohort of Malay people understand and give meaning to the concept of 'good quality marital relationship'. Research studies on marital quality in Malay culture are very limited and numerically at least, they compare poorly to western scholarly output on this subject. Even though much contemporary marriage literature refers to the importance of gaining an appreciation of cultural issues related to marriage and family, there is a real need for more cross-cultural research. In examining Malay concepts of quality marriage I not only address a culturally-specific research need but attempt to use this to advance cultural sensitivity among relevant policy makers, practitioners, researchers and members of the public. In this research, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted in the Kubang Pasu district, in Kedah, one of the northern states of Malaysia with forty-five participants across different socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds. In what is an exploratory study I adopted a combination of maximum variation and purposive sampling and utilised a grounded theory framework to underpin the analysis. The data were analysed using both rigorous manual coding and NVivo qualitative software.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marital quality -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Malays (Asian people) -- Marriage customs and rites</field><field name="subject">Islamic marriage customs and rites -- Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Marital quality</field><field name="subject">Malays</field><field name="subject">Marriage</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical pharmacology of the treatment of malaria in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Karunajeewa, Harin Ashley</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Malaria is the most important parasitic disease of man. Of the five species known to infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum causes most deaths and illness, especially when it affects children and pregnant women living in highly endemic areas of the rural tropics. Pharmacological therapies for malaria must be optimised for these groups and must be practical for administration in critically ill patients in remote settings. The clinical studies in this thesis evaluated the clinical pharmacology of modern antimalarial treatments in a Melanesian population exposed to highly endemic malaria. The clinical studies were conducted between March 2001 and June 2007, with final data analysis completed by mid-2008. They aimed to evaluate key pharmacokinetic, parasitological, host genetic and socio-cultural determinants of treatment effectiveness in children with uncomplicated and severe malaria and in pregnant women. A multi-centre study of children with uncomplicated malaria evaluated the efficacy of four treatment regimens, including three artemisinin combination treatments. PCR corrected recrudescence rates by day 42 were 81.5%, 85.4%, 88.0% and 95.2% for chloroquine + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL), respectively. Determinants of efficacy in the DHA-PQ group included day 7 piperaquine (PQ) levels and baseline parasitaemia. Therefore, the worse than expected efficacy in this group may have been partly due to the high parasitaemias commonly seen in this population.  ... Preliminary data suggested a protective effect of the erythrocyte polymorphism caused by the glycophorin C mutation against cerebral malaria. These studies also evaluated key pharmacokinetic, host genetic and socio-cultural determinants of the likely effectiveness of a novel pharmaceutical approach using artesunate suppositories for severe malaria. These demonstrated favourable absorption characteristics, clinical efficacy, safety and patient/community acceptability. Contrary to previous data, no evidence was found to suggest that the pharmacokinetic profiles or efficacy of artemisinin derivatives are likely to be compromised by a high prevalence of   thalassaemia in this population. However, their highly variable bioavailability raises questions regarding the consistency of therapeutic response. Given the favourable efficacy and socio-cultural acceptability of rectal artesunate demonstrated in these studies, the PNG Ministry of Health has decided to add artesunate suppositories to its national pharmacopoeia and incorporate them into standard treatment recommendations. A final study compared the pharmacokinetics of chloroquine, sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine in pregnant, versus non-pregnant women. This demonstrated significantly lower concentrations of all three drugs and active metabolites in the pregnant group, due to a combination of effects on either volume of distribution, clearance and elimination half-life. It suggests that significant dosage alterations are necessary to optimise therapy in pregnant women.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Malaria -- Papua New Guinea</field><field name="subject">Malaria -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Malaria</field><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology</field><field name="subject">Papua New Guinea</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reputational orientations and aggression : extending reputation enhancement theory to upper primary school aged bullies</field><field name="creator">Nathan, Elijah</field><field name="description">The research reported in this thesis investigated the reputational orientations and aggressive behaviour of primary school aged bullies. It also sought to determine whether the reputational orientations of bullies who were loners differed to those who had established friendship networks. To achieve the research aims four separate yet inter-related studies were conducted. Study One explored the construct of reputation and its relevance to the bullying behaviours of 23 male and 23 female Grade 5 (10 year old) children from eight separate primary schools. All of these children had been suspended from school because of their bullying. Semi structured interviews revealed that reputation was an important construct to bullies, primarily because of the feelings of strength, power, and social status attributed to them by others as a result of their bullying. They also reported that the type of image and status they attained from bullying others was what they were actively seeking. To achieve their desired image different types of overt and covert bullying acts were perpetrated. The bullies also revealed that they carefully selected the physical locations where they bullied others so as to maximize the visibility of their actions to others. The school oval, playground and toilets were the most popular locations, but the use of new media such as mobile phones and the internet allowed them to bully others without the presence of an audience. The bullies also reported that their victims communicated what had happened to them to others, which disseminated their actions to a wider audience.  It was clearly evident from Study One that the construct of reputation was important to bullies and was worthy of further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aggressiveness in children</field><field name="subject">Bullying in schools</field><field name="subject">Group identity</field><field name="subject">Interpersonal relations in children</field><field name="subject">School violence</field><field name="subject">Self-esteem in children</field><field name="subject">Reputation enhancement</field><field name="subject">Bullies</field><field name="subject">Social identity</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Two and three dimensional stability analyses for soil and rock slopes</field><field name="creator">Li, An-Jui</field><field name="description">Slope stability assessments are classical problems for geotechnical engineers. The predictions of slope stability in soil or rock masses play an important role when designing for dams, roads, tunnels, excavations, open pit mines and other engineering structures. Stability charts continue to be used by engineers as preliminary design tools and by educators for training purposes. However, the majority of the existing chart solutions assume the slope problem is semi-infinite (plane-strain) in length. It is commonly believed that this assumption is conservative for design, but non-conservative when a back-analysis is performed. In order to obtain a more economical design or more precise parameters from a back-analysis, it is therefore important to quantify three dimensional boundary effects on slope stability. A significant aim of this research is to look more closely at the effect of three dimensions when predicting slope stability. In engineering practice, the limit equilibrium method (LEM) is the most popular approach for estimating the slope stability. It is well known that the solution obtained from the limit equilibrium method is not rigorous, because neither static nor kinematic admissibility conditions are satisfied. In addition, assumptions are made regarding inter slice forces for a two dimensional case and inter-column forces for a three dimensional case in order to find a solution. Therefore, a number of more theoretically rigorous numerical methods have been used in this research when studying 2D and 3D slope problems. In this thesis, the results of a comprehensive numerical study into the failure mechanisms of soil and rock slopes are presented. Consideration is given to the wide range of parameters that influence slope stability. The aim of this research is to better understand slope failure mechanisms and to develop rigorous stability solutions that can be used by design engineers. The study is unique in that two distinctly different numerical methods have been used in tandem to determine the ultimate stability of slopes, namely the upper and lower bound theorems of limit analysis and the displacement finite element method. The limit equilibrium method is also employed for comparison purposes. A comparison of the results from each technique provides an opportunity to validate the findings and gives a rigorous evaluation of slope stability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Earthquake hazard analysis</field><field name="subject">Rock slopes</field><field name="subject">Slopes (Soil mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Soil stabilization</field><field name="subject">Factor of safety</field><field name="subject">Earthquake</field><field name="subject">Dimensionless parameter</field><field name="subject">Rock disturbance</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of dendritic cells in the cross-presentation of tumour antigens</field><field name="creator">McDonnell, Alison</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A paradox exists in tumour immunology whereby progressive tumour growth exists in parallel with an anti-tumour T cell response. This defective T cell response is thought to result from the induction of T cell tolerance and/or tumour induced immunosuppression, which act to inhibit the activation, differentiation and function of tumour-specific CD8+ T cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that are critical to the generation of effective CTL; however their function and phenotype is often defective or altered in tumour-bearing hosts, which may limit their capacity to mount an effective tumour specific T cell response. In this thesis, the role of DCs in the cross-presentation of tumour antigen was assessed in terms of their APC function, migration and location. In doing so the intention was to gain insight into the early processes that potentially contribute to the development of an ineffective anti-tumour immune response. This study examined cross-presentation of the nominal tumour antigen, influenza A hemagglutinin (HA) expressed by the murine malignant mesothelioma cell line, AB1-HA. Cross-presentation was predominantly restricted to the local draining lymph nodes throughout tumour growth and was mediated by CD8a+ and CD8a- DCs. This results in an ineffective CTL response due to the lack of DC activation and the presence of potentially immunosuppressive B7 molecules. However, the capacity of the CD8a- DC subset to cross-present antigen suggested a role for migratory tumour-resident DCs in this process. Analysis of tumour infiltrating DCs showed that they were paralysed in their capacity to cross-present tumour antigen and were immobilised at the tumour site. Conversely, cross-presentation of tumour antigen in the local draining lymph node was dependent on the continuous traffic of antigen from the tumour microenvironment. In this vein, small numbers of metastatic tumour cells were detected in the draining lymph nodes, however their isolation was dependent on the removal of DCs and T cells, suggesting immune control of metastatic spread. Thus, tumour cells may be the source of antigen for cross-presentation by DCs in the tumour draining lymph nodes.  .... In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis support a role for DCs in the generation of tumour-specific T cell responses that fail to control tumour growth. In addition the results provide a basis for further investigation into the effects of chemotherapy on the source and form of tumour antigen for cross-presentation by specific DC subsets in the tumour bearing host. These findings may have important implications for the development of future anti-cancer immune therapies targeting DCs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumours -- Immunological aspects -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells</field><field name="subject">Tumor antigens</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Tumour immunology</field><field name="subject">T lymphocytes</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of fly-in/fly-out commute arrangements and extended working hours on the stress, lifestyle, relationships and health characteristics of Western Australian mining employees and their partners</field><field name="creator">Clifford, Susan Amanda</field><field name="description">The Western Australian (WA) mining industry directly employs approximately 56,000 people. Almost half work Fly-in/Fly-out commute arrangements (FIFO, e.g. employees living in a city are flown to a remote worksite where they live and work during their work roster) and approximately half work more than 50 hours per week, on average. There are many anecdotal claims that FIFO has negative impacts on WA mining employees, leading to an elevated risk of high stress levels, depression, binge drinking, recreational drug use and relationship break-ups. Previous studies found FIFO can be stressful, and have negative impacts on WA employees 'and partners' lifestyles and relationships. This project investigated the long-term (Study One) and short-term (Study Two) impacts of FIFO and extended working hours on a representative sample of WA FIFO mining employees and partners. In Study One, a total of 222 FIFO and Daily Commute (DC) mining employees and partners completed an anonymous questionnaire investigating long-term impacts on work satisfaction, lifestyle, relationships and health. A subgroup of 32 Study One FIFO employees and partners also participated in Study Two; a detailed study of the short-term impacts of FIFO and extended working hours and how these impacts fluctuate in intensity during the mining roster. Study Two participants completed a diary and provided saliva samples each day throughout a complete mining roster. The main findings of the study were that FIFO and extended working hours had negative impacts on employees work satisfaction and FIFO was frequently reported to be disruptive to employees 'and partners' lifestyle, in the long-term. However, FIFO and extended working hours did not lead to poor quality relationships, high stress levels or poor health, on average in the long-term; there were generally no significant differences in these characteristics between FIFO and DC employees, or between the FIFO sample and the wider community. There were minor differences between FIFO and DC employees in long-term health characteristics, and Study One employees had similar, or in some cases poorer health outcomes than other community samples.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Commuters -- Western Australia -- Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Commuting -- Social aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Commuting -- Western Australia -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Hours of labor -- Social aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Mineral industries -- Western Australia -- Employees -- Family relationships</field><field name="subject">Stress (Physiology)</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Fly-in/Fly-out</field><field name="subject">Long distance commute</field><field name="subject">Daily commute</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">Health</field><field name="subject">Relationships</field><field name="subject">Stress</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A parallel model for the heterogeneous computation of radio astronomy signal correlation</field><field name="creator">Harris, Christopher John</field><field name="description">The computational requirements of scientific research are constantly growing. In the field of radio astronomy, observations have evolved from using single telescopes, to interferometer arrays of many telescopes, and there are currently arrays of massive scale under development. These interferometers use signal and image processing to produce data that is useful to radio astronomy, and the amount of processing required scales quadratically with the scale of the array. Traditional computational approaches are unable to meet this demand in the near future. This thesis explores the use of heterogeneous parallel processing to meet the computational demands of radio astronomy. In heterogeneous computing, multiple hardware architectures are used for processing. In this work, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is used as a co-processor along with the Central Processing Unit (CPU) for the computation of signal processing algorithms. Specifically, the suitability of the GPU to accelerate the correlator algorithms used in radio astronomy is investigated. This work first implemented a FX correlator on the GPU, with a performance increase of one to two orders of magnitude over a serial CPU approach. The FX correlator algorithm combines pairs of telescope signals in the Fourier domain. Given N telescope signals from the interferometer array, N2 conjugate multiplications must be calculated in the algorithm. For extremely large arrays (N &gt;&gt; 30), this is a huge computational requirement. Testing will show that the GPU correlator produces results equivalent to that of a software correlator implemented on the CPU. However, the algorithm itself is adapted in order to take advantage of the processing power of the GPU. Research examined how correlator parameters, in particular the number of telescope signals and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) length, affected the results.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">correlator</field><field name="subject">GPU</field><field name="subject">Graphics processing unit</field><field name="subject">Polyphase</field><field name="subject">Filterbank</field><field name="subject">Radio astronomy</field><field name="subject">Heterogeneous</field><field name="subject">Correlation</field><field name="subject">Computing</field><field name="subject">Radio astronomy</field><field name="subject">Interferometry</field><field name="subject">Parallel processing (Electronic computers)</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of long-term homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid, vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12 on vascular structure and function in stroke</field><field name="creator">Potter, Kathleen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] An elevated total plasma homocysteine concentration (tHcy) is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Folic acid, vitamin B6 and B12 supplements significantly reduce tHcy even in people who are not overtly vitamin deficient. If homocysteine is a causal risk factor for atherothrombotic events, treatment with B-vitamins might prove a simple and cost-effective means to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, it remains unclear whether elevated tHcy causes atherosclerosis or is simply a risk marker. To prove that homocysteine is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease it is necessary to show that lowering tHcy reduces vascular risk. The aim of this study was to determine whether long-term homocysteine-lowering with B-vitamins would improve vascular structure and function in people with a history of stroke. This study was a cross-sectional sub-study of the Vitamins TO Prevent Stroke trial (VITATOPS), a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to test the efficacy and safety of B-vitamins (folic acid 2mg, vitamin B6 25mg and vitamin B12 0.5mg) in the prevention of vascular events in patients with a recent history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 173 VITATOPS participants were recruited for the current study. Age, sex, stroke type, medications, cardiovascular risk factors and smoking history were recorded and blood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip girth were measured in all subjects at least two years after randomisation.  ... After a mean treatment period of 3.9 &#177; 0.9 years, the subjects randomised to vitamin treatment had significantly lower tHcy than the subjects randomised to placebo (7.9mol/L, 95%CI 7.5, 8.4 versus 11.8mol/L, 95%CI 10.9, 12.8; p&lt;0.001). There were no significant differences between groups in CIMT (0.84 &#177; 0.17mm vitamins versus 0.83 &#177; 0.18mm placebo; p=0.74) or FMD (median of 4.0%, IQR 0.9, 7.2, vitamins versus 3.0%, IQR 0.6, 6.6 placebo; p=0.48). Pooled estimates from the meta-analyses showed that B-vitamin treatment reduces CIMT by 0.10mm (95%CI &#150;0.20, -0.01mm) and increases FMD by 1.4%, (95%CI 0.7, 2.2), although these estimates may have been influenced by positive publication bias. The improvement in FMD was significant in studies of less than eight weeks duration but not in studies with longer treatment periods. The association between tHcy and CIMT and FMD was eliminated by adjustment for renal function and long-term B-vitamin treatment did not alter the strong linear relationship between tHcy and cystatin C. Lowering tHcy did not alter arterial wall inflammation assessed by 18FDG-PET, although small subject numbers meant we were unable to exclude a minor treatment effect.  Long-term homocysteine-lowering with B-vitamin treatment did not improve CIMT or FMD or reduce arterial wall inflammation in people with a history of stroke. The relationship between tHcy and these markers of vascular risk was eliminated by adjustment for renal function. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that elevated tHcy is a risk marker for cardiovascular disease rather than a modifiable causal risk factor.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cerebrovascular disease -- Prevention</field><field name="subject">Homocysteine -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Vitamin B12 -- Therapeutic use -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Vitamin B6 -- Therapeutic use -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Folic acid -- Therapeutic use -- Testing</field><field name="subject">Vitamin B complex</field><field name="subject">Folic acid</field><field name="subject">B-vitamins</field><field name="subject">Carotid intima medial thickness</field><field name="subject">Cystatin C</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multinuclear platinum anticancer therapeutics : insights into their solution chemistry and DNA binding interactions from NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling</field><field name="creator">Ruhayel, Rasha A.</field><field name="description">In the 1980's, Nicholas Farrell developed a range of structurally distinct multinuclear Pt complexes that form long-range interstrand crosslinks (IXLs) in DNA. The dinuclear complex [{trans-PtCl2(NH3)}2-&#181;-(H2N(CH2)6NH2)]2+ (1,1/t,t) was the first of this series to show promising results, however, it was the trinuclear complex [{trans-PtCl2(NH3)}2-&#181;-trans-Pt(NH3)2(H2N(CH2)6NH2)2]4+ (1,0,1/t,t,t or BBR3464) that was chosen for clinical trials based on significantly increased cytotoxicity compared to 1,1/t,t and cisplatin. Molecular biology experiments have shown that 1,1/t,t exclusively forms IXLs in DNA in the 5'&#191; 5' direction, whilst 1,0,1/t,t,t can form IXLs in both the 5'&#191;5' and 3'&#191;3' directions.

A combination of 1D 1H and 2D [1H, 15N] HSQC NMR experiments was used to directly compare the results with the stepwise formation of the 5'&#150;5' 1,4&#150;GG IXL with the previously studied duplex, 5' {d(ATATGTACATAT)2} (55&#150;14XL), under the same conditions. Preassociation as well as aquation were similar, however, differences were observed at the monofunctional binding step with evidence for numerous monofunctional adducts. Both reactions did not yield a single 3'&#150;3' 1,4&#150;GG IXL, rather several adducts that could not be characterised. Molecular dynamics simulations of the 3'&#150;3' 1,4&#150;GG IXLs showed highly distorted lesions that may have implication in cellular repair processes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anticancer complexes</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">Kinetics</field><field name="subject">Platinum</field><field name="subject">Inorganic chemistry</field><field name="subject">Aquation</field><field name="subject">&#185;H/&#185;5N NMR</field><field name="subject">&#185;5N synthesis</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Chemotherapy</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Antineoplastic agents</field><field name="subject">DNA-ligand interactions</field><field name="subject">Cisplatin</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrinsic differences of the airway epithelium in childhood allergic asthma</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Paul</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Asthma affects millions of people worldwide and places a substantial burden on the healthcare system. Despite advances in our understanding of disease mechanisms and the role of respiratory viruses in asthma exacerbations, there is little known regarding the role of the epithelium in commonly observed structural changes in the airway wall. The epithelium of the airways provides an essential protective barrier between the environment and underlying structures and is responsible for the secretion of diverse compounds. Since it is likely that dysregulated epithelial characteristics and function in childhood asthma are critical determinants of disease progression in adults, it is pertinent to investigate the cellular mechanisms involved in paediatric asthma. However, full comprehension of paediatric respiratory diseases and the childhood antecedents of adult respiratory disease are currently hampered by the difficulty in obtaining relevant target organ tissue and most of the data to date have been generated from studies involving adults or commercially derived cell lines. This laboratory has successfully developed methodologies of obtaining and studying samples of paediatric primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) and has identified significant biochemical and functional differences between healthy non-atopic (pAECHNA) and atopic asthmatic (pAECAA) airway cells, which have assisted in the identification of potential mechanisms responsible for abnormal epithelial function. Stevens 2009  ...  Exposure of pAECs with RV resulted in elevated PAI-1 mRNA expression and reduced MMP-9 release in both pAECAA and pAECHNA samples. Collectively, the data presented indicate that RV exposure induces a pronounced antiproliferative and retardative repair effect in pAECAA and that the presence of virus may have a role in the PAI-1 and MMP expression witnessed in these cells. In conclusion, this investigation has further characterised the essential role the airway epithelium plays in childhood asthma by demonstrating for the first time that pAECs from asthmatic children lack the ability to successfully repair mechanically induced wounds. This investigation also showed that PAI-1 is elevated in pAECAA and has a functional role in the pAEC proliferative and regenerative processes. It was demonstrated that MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and the MMP-9/TIMP-1 as well as MMP2/TIMP2 ratios were significantly reduced in pAECAA thereby providing additional evidence that there is a dysregulation in the mechanisms that monitor the turnover of the ECM in childhood asthma. Furthermore, this study has shown for the first time that pAECs from untreated mild atopic-asthmatic children are more sensitive to the pathogenic effects of RV than healthy control cells and that RV exposure delays cellular proliferation and repair. Ultimately, these findings support the hypothesis postulated and provide evidence that indeed the dysregulated epithelial functional characteristics seen in childhood mild asthma may be a critical determinant of disease progression in adults.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma in children -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Epithelial cells</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Epithelium</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0022</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Widowhood and remarriage in colonial Australia</field><field name="creator">Hart, Susan</field><field name="description">Widowhood and remarriage affected a majority of people in colonial Australia, yet historians have given them scant attention. Today, widowhood primarily concerns the elderly, but in the mid-nineteenth century a considerable proportion of deaths were amongst young adults. Thus many widows and widowers had children to care for, who were also affected by the loss of a parent and the possible remarriage of their surviving parent. Extended families might be called on for support, while communities, at the local and government level, were confronted with the need to provide welfare for the widowed and orphaned, including the older widowed. This thesis considers how widowhood impacted on men and women at all levels of society in the nineteenth-century Australian colonies, especially Western Australia and Victoria, taking into account the effects of age, class and numbers of children of the widowed. When men were the chief family earners and women were dependent child bearers the effects of widowhood could be disastrous, and widows had to employ a range of strategies to support themselves and their families. Men too were affected by widowhood, for the loss of a wife&#146;s housekeeping skills could cause serious financial consequences. One response to widowhood was remarriage, and the thesis discusses the advantages and disadvantages of remarriage for men and women. Historians have regarded remarriage as the best option for the widowed, especially for women. Research into remarriage, especially in Britain and Europe, has focussed on demography. Assuming that all widowed wished to remarry, demographers have compared remarriage rates for men and women, within the context of the relative numbers of marriageable men and women in a given community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Widowhood -- Australia -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Remarriage -- Australia -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Widowhood</field><field name="subject">Colonial Australia</field><field name="subject">Remarriage</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0023</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the role of attentional engagement and attentional disengagement in anxiety-linked attentional bias</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Patrick</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] It has consistently been found that individuals who are more highly vulnerable to anxious mood selectively attend to emotionally negative stimuli as compared to those lower in anxiety vulnerability, suggesting that such anxiety-prone individuals possess an attentional bias favouring negative information. Two of the most consistent tasks used to reveal this bias have been the attentional probe and emotional Stroop tasks. It has been noted, however, that these tasks have not been capable of differentiating the relative role of attentional engagement with, and attentional disengagement from emotionally valenced stimuli, suggesting that either of these attentional processes could account for the attentional bias observed in individuals with high levels of anxiety vulnerability on the attentional probe and emotional Stroop tasks. A number of resent studies have claimed support for the operation of biased attentional disengagement in anxiety using a modified attentional cueing paradigm, concluding that individuals more vulnerable to anxious mood have a selective difficulty disengaging attention from emotionally negative stimuli. The current thesis highlights the possibility, however, that the structure of the modified cueing paradigm could allow individual differences in initial attentional engagement with differentially valenced stimuli to be interpreted as a selective disengagement bias.  ...  The modified emotional Stroop task employed in the current research measured participant's ability to engage with the emotional content of differentially valenced stimuli having initially processed non-emotional information (stimulus colour), and measured their relative ability to disengage attention from such emotional content to process non-emotional stimulus information. Results using this modified Stroop task suggested that those with high vulnerability to anxious mood were disproportionately fast to engage with the content of negative as compared to non-negative stimuli whereas those with low vulnerability to anxious mood did not display this pattern. The results provided no support for presence of an anxiety-linked bias in attentional disengagement from the content of differentially valenced stimuli. Results derived from the modified emotional Stroop task therefore provided support for the presence of an anxiety-linked bias in attentional engagement with the content of emotionally negative stimuli, but no support for a bias in attentional disengagement from the content of such material. The final study in the present series of experiments was designed to address the novel possibility that a bias in attentional disengagement could result in ongoing semantic activation of negatively valenced stimuli which would not necessarily be indexed by previous tasks assessing biased attentional disengagement. The results of this final study, however, provided no evidence to suggest the presence of anxiety-linked differences in ongoing semantic activation of differentially valenced stimuli. The present series of studies therefore provide support for the presence of an anxiety-linked bias in attentional engagement with the content of emotionally negative stimuli, while providing no support  for the presence of an anxiety-linked bias in attentional disengagement from negative stimuli.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Attention -- Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Emotions and cognition</field><field name="subject">Anxiety</field><field name="subject">Attentional bias</field><field name="subject">Attentional engagement</field><field name="subject">Attentional disengagement</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Maternal and neonatal immune responses to pneumococcal protein antigens in relation to risk for early upper respiratory tract (URT) pneumococcal carriage in a high-risk population in Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Francis, Jacinta Piwen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Pneumococcal exposure is high and life-long in developing countries including Papua New Guinea (PNG), with children under 2 years of age being at most risk for early upper respiratory tract pneumococcal carriage and infection. Deaths from pneumococcal diseases such as pneumonia and meningitis are common and likely the result of an absence of vaccination programmes. The need for effective and affordable pneumococcal vaccines has led to the testing of protein antigens including pneumolysin (Ply) and pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) as novel vaccine antigens. Little is known on the immune responses to these proteins in humans, particularly in high-risk populations where such vaccines will be of most benefit. In this study, we examined the roles of naturally acquired antibody and cellular immune responses in mothers and newborns to Ply and PspA family 1 (PspA1) and family 2 (PspA2) in protection against or risk for early carriage in a high-risk PNG population. Antibodies to Ply, PspA1 and PspA2 were measured in plasmas of 241 mothers and 115 newborns (cords) from PNG, and 50 Australian mothers using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pernasal swabs were collected from PNG mothers at the time of delivery, one month post-partum, and weekly within the first month of life from their newborns to determine pneumococcal carriage. Cellular immune responses to Ply, PspA1 and PspA2, the TLR2/TLR4 ligands, LTA and LPS and to PHA were measured in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) of 84 PNG versus 33 Australian newborns. Innate and T-cell cytokine responses in the PNG newborns were then analysed to determine their effect on infant pneumococcal carriage.  ... No protective effect against infant pneumococcal carriage was observed with maternal and cord IgG levels for all antigens. Maternal carriage at time of delivery increased the risk for infant pneumococcal carriage in the first month of life (HR: 1.93, 95% CI 1.36 &#150; 2.73, p = 0.001) with 70% of infants being colonised. Papua New Guinean newborns produced higher innate IL-10 and IFN-&#191; (p = 0.003) and TNF-a (p &lt; 0.001) to Ply compared to Australian newborns with no significant differences observed for IL-6 or IL-12. IFN-&#191; responses to LPS and LTA (p = 0.005 and p &lt; 0.001) were higher in PNG than Australian newborns, while IL-6, IL-10 (p &lt; 0.001) and TNF-a (p = 0.002) to LPS with LTA-induced IL-6 and IL-10 (p &lt; 0.001) were higher in Australian newborns. T-cell IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-&#191;, IL-6 and TNF-a response levels to PspA and PHA stimulation were significantly high in PNG newborns. No differences were observed for cytokine responses to Ply and PspA between PNG infant pneumococci carriers and non-carriers. Papua New Guinean infants are colonised by pneumococci very early in life and this may be influenced by high maternal carriage rates. PspA- and Ply-IgG levels are high in PNG mothers and undergo cross placental transfer but do not appear to be protective against early pneumococcal carriage. In PNG newborns, PspA elicits T-cell responses, while Ply drives more innate cellular responses, neither were demonstrated to have a protective effect against early carriage though further work is required to better define these and their relation to immune development in early childhood.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatal infections</field><field name="subject">Newborn infants -- Immunology</field><field name="subject">Pneumococcal vaccine</field><field name="subject">Respiratory infections -- Immunological aspects</field><field name="subject">Streptococcus pneumoniae -- Infants</field><field name="subject">Pneumococcal protein antigens</field><field name="subject">Upper respiratory tract carriage</field><field name="subject">Immune responses</field><field name="subject">Maternal</field><field name="subject">Neonatal</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of the human CD30 gene through an intronic enhancer</field><field name="creator">Ho, Desiree Shulin</field><field name="description">Lymphomas are neoplasms of the human immune system and can be divided into two categories, Hodgkin&#146;s lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a form of NHL that shares a common distinctive feature with HL, the overexpression CD30. The expression of cytokine receptor CD30 is restricted to proliferating B and T lymphocytes in healthy individuals while its overexpression is associated with several lymphoproliferative diseases such as ALCL and HL. The activation of CD30 via ligand or antibodies triggers various cellular responses ranging from apoptosis to cell proliferation and it is thought that the variable cellular response to CD30 activation may be due to cell surface levels of CD30. The human CD30 gene is regulated at the transcriptional level and previous studies characterising its promoter have identified several factors that regulate the expression this gene. However none of these identified factors explain for the high levels of CD30 observed in HL and ALCL. Therefore this study focused on the identification and functional analysis of transcriptionally active regions located up or downstream of the CD30 promoter region. The first aim for this study was to identify and characterise regions within the human CD30 gene that are involved in its transcriptional regulation. Phylogenetic footprinting identified several regions downstream of the CD30 promoter that displayed high levels of sequence homology indicating potential functional significance. Validation of these regions through two in vivo approaches, DNase 1 hypersensitivity assay and chromatin accessibility studies localised potential transcriptionally active regions to intron 1 of the CD30 gene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytokines -- Receptors</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Genetic regulation</field><field name="subject">Genetic transcription -- Regulation</field><field name="subject">Hodgkin's disease</field><field name="subject">Lymphomas</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional regulation</field><field name="subject">CD30</field><field name="subject">Anaplastic large cell lymphoma</field><field name="subject">Hodgkin's lymphoma</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteins associated with the intracellular signalling tail of the calcium-sensing receptor and their impact on receptor function</field><field name="creator">Magno, Aaron</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that can respond to changes in extracellular calcium and plays an integral role in calcium homeostasis. Later studies revealed that the CaR was stimulated by not just calcium, but a diverse range of stimuli and that activation of the receptor regulated a host of different biological processes. The CaR is linked to these cellular responses via the various signalling pathways initiated by the receptor. Recent yeast two-hybrid studies have identified a number of accessory proteins that, through their interaction with the intracellular tail of the CaR, are able to regulate important functional aspects of the receptor, including its signalling and degradation. We hypothesised that many more proteins that bind to the CaR-tail await identification, especially since most of the previous studies used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen cDNA libraries generated from tissues that are important to whole body calcium homeostasis, such as the parathyroid gland and kidney. In order to identify novel binding partners of the CaR, which may affect its function, particularly in biological processes that might be unrelated to calcium homeostasis, our laboratory performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of an EMLC.1 mouse pluripotent haemopoietic cell line library using the intracellular tail of the human CaR as bait.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Generalized Splitting method for Combinatorial Counting and Static Rare-Event Probability Estimation</field><field name="creator">Zdravko Botev</field><field name="description">This thesis is divided into two parts.

UML is the accepted standard modelling language for describing object-oriented (OO) systems for analysis and design, and many UML CASE tools have been built and are used in academia and industry. OO technology and UML is an ongoing area of research, and many applications have been developed using OO technology. However, observations on current software development practices in some computer companies have shown that many OO software developers are not adopting recognised OOAD techniques. Both information technology (IT) students at higher educational institutions and professionals have in general found difficulty in grasping OO concepts, and the role that UML diagrams play in the design of the analysis and design solution. They particularly find difficulty in performing abstractions of real-world problems within the context of OOAD. They are unable to effectively build class diagrams from the problem domain because they essentially do not know &#8216;what&#8217; to model. They therefore prefer to start coding software applications before building the analysis and design artifacts. Most of these students invariably prefer to focus on the implementation phase of a software development lifecycle and consider the preceding analysis and design phases superfluous. The overall goal of this thesis is to contribute to a significant improvement in the way students and software developers analyse and design their OO systems. We present a new approach by introducing concept mapping as a tool to help novices in OOAD produce more appropriate UML class and sequence diagrams. The class and sequence diagrams are selected because they represent the essential static and behavioural aspects of a problem domain. The former is fundamental to the OO modelling process and the latter is one of the most widely used dynamic diagrams in UML. Concept mapping is a popular tool used in education for facilitating learning, comprehension and the development of knowledge. Within the context of OOAD, we propose to use concept maps as a graphical representation of fundamental concepts, and their relationships and responsibilities within a problem domain. A static concept map derived from expanded use cases (use case narratives) can subsequently evolve into a class diagram containing information on classes, attributes, associations and generalisation-specialisation hierarchies. A dynamic concept map derived from an expanded use case can evolve into a sequence diagram containing information on the interaction of objects (and their messages) to fulfil the responsibilities of a particular scenario of the use case. In this thesis, a study is initially conducted to investigate in detail the difficulties undergraduate students have when producing UML class and sequence diagrams. The results of the study reveal and confirm some of the fundamental problems that students have with OO modelling. In order to address these problems, a concept-driven approach is developed to help novices produce more appropriate UML class and sequence diagrams. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by three different experiments. The data from these experiments is analysed and there is sufficient statistical evidence to support the claim that the participants produce more appropriate class and sequence diagrams after being taught concept mapping techniques. As a result of this positive outcome, a set of guidelines is developed for teaching OO modelling with concept maps. These guidelines could be integrated into existing OOAD courses to help software engineering educators resolve some of the difficulties they face when teaching OOAD.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">08 Information and Computing Sciences</field><field name="subject">concept maps</field><field name="subject">object-orientation</field><field name="subject">UML</field><field name="subject">analysis</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">class diagram</field><field name="subject">sequence diagram</field><field name="subject">Experiment</field><field name="subject">OOAD education</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legitimation of violence against women in Colombia: A feminist critical discourse analytic study</field><field name="creator">Laura Tolton</field><field name="description">This study analyses the legitimation of violence against women in Colombia, using critical discourse analysis to explore attitudes related to violence, gender, and power. Internet forums from the website of the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo provide everyday examples of talk about two incidents of violence against women (VAW), a sexual assault and a wife-beating, both of which triggered a large scale reaction from the Colombian public. Colombia is a unique context to study the normalisation of VAW. This nation has been characterised by high levels of violence over the last sixty years, suffering through evolving stages of armed conflict. Militarisation has been shown to increase the occurrence of VAW (Kelly, 2000), and the normalisation of VAW may intensify as well in militarily violent contexts (Hume, 2004; McWilliams, 1998). Critical discourse analysis offers theory and methodology to examine an aspect of life in terms of social justice and power (Fairclough, 2003; Resende, 2009), denaturalising the discursive practices which help to produce and reproduce power relations between social groups (Fairclough &amp; Wodak, 1997; van Dijk, 1993). This study examines legitimation, a social action realised in discourse, which has the goal of setting and reinforcing a certain social order. The project also explores how legitimation in these forums is tied to Colombian culture and the topic of VAW. Drawing on the methods of van Dijk (1988, 1998, 2001) ,Wood and Kroger (2000), and grounded theory (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008), multiple readings of the forums elicited salient themes as well as discursive strategies used to carry out legitimation of VAW. These were analysed in terms of underlying social beliefs prevailing in Colombian society. Dominant themes emerging from analysis of the sexual assault forums include: &#8216;&#8220;real&#8221; violence is more important&#8217;; &#8216;this incident was not a big deal&#8217;; &#8216;it&#8217;s her fault anyway&#8217;; and &#8216;she should have appreciated it&#8217;. These manifest the dominant strategies and structures of contrasts, minimisation, victim blaming, and romanticisation/sexualisation, respectively. Analysis of the wife-beating forums reveals the following themes: &#8216;this is not related to me&#8217;; &#8216;wife-beating is a private issue&#8217;; &#8216;domestic violence is normal and even important&#8217;; &#8216;it is the victim&#8217;s responsibility to change&#8217;; and &#8216;the victim deserves this violence&#8217;. Dominant strategies included respectively: distancing explanations and solutions, discourses of privacy, normalising violence, focusing on the victim, and victim blaming. The forum analyses illustrate how legitimation relates to Colombian culture and the topic of VAW. Numerous elements of culture and topic are used to criticise women&#8217;s agency and suggest that women ought to be passive and silent. In one culture-related example, the Colombian reiteration of violent events works to silence women&#8217;s stories about their experiences of VAW. Another strong element of culture is found in Colombian sayings and proverbs presenting a common knowledge discourse normalising VAW as romantic, sexual and necessary. Discourses used more universally to justify VAW include the idea that women belong in the private sphere and the psychopathologisation of women as attention-seeking and slutty. These elements work together to suggest that women are strong, sexual, and dangerous, needing violence from an authority to keep them uncomplaining and submissive. This work can inform future studies about discourse concerning VAW in Hispanic contexts, sketching in a little-studied disciplinary intersection. As this research participates in the aims of feminist critical discourse analysis, it is hoped that the present study will also be used for critical campaigns aimed at media specialists and educators so that they may create greater awareness and promote change, pointing out and discouraging these discourses legitimating violence against women in Colombia.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feminist critical discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">violence against women</field><field name="subject">wife abuse</field><field name="subject">sexual assault</field><field name="subject">legitimation</field><field name="subject">Spanish linguistics</field><field name="subject">Colombian culture</field><field name="subject">macropropositions</field><field name="subject">strategies</field><field name="subject">online newspaper forums</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost-effective Conservation Planning</field><field name="creator">Josie Carwardine</field><field name="description">Biodiversity is declining globally due to mounting anthropogenic threats. Actions to protect biodiversity against threats can be costly, involving land purchase, invasive species management, and inflicting opportunity costs of lost revenue and livelihoods in conservation areas. Governments and conservation organisations are under increasing pressure to deliver the greatest benefits from conservation funds, and to minimise conflicts between conservation and other human priorities. Most conservation planning approaches are limited in their ability to assist with cost-effective funding allocation decisions. First, approaches often lack quantifiable objectives and appropriate tools. Second, approaches rarely consider economic information, such as spatially explicit data on the costs of conservation actions. In this thesis I address these two limitations, which often co-occur, in spatial conservation planning. Problem definition includes specifying a quantifiable objective, a set of constraints and control variables, and knowledge of the system. A simple conservation objective is to protect target amounts of biodiversity features, such as 15% of the range of each species and vegetation type, over a minimal total reserve area. Here, targets are the constraints and the control variables are the decisions of whether or not to conserve each site. Target-based conservation planning is the dominant spatial prioritisation approach, but has been criticised for failing to protect untargeted portions of biodiversity and for employing targets too low to ensure species persistence. In Chapter 2, I review target-based systematic conservation planning, discovering that many perceived limitations can be overcome with current developments in research and software and better communication, whilst acknowledging the value of alternative approaches. Conservation planning objectives are becoming increasingly complex due to the need to conserve many kinds of features, such as species, habitat types, and ecosystem services. Measures of the spatial congruence between features is often used to determine if one feature is a good surrogate for representing another and whether multiple features can be easily captured in a single plan. In Chapter 3 I review the use of congruence metrics in conservation planning research, explaining the differences between the three most common metrics &#8211; spatial correlation, hotspot overlap, incidental representation &#8211; and demonstrating why high values in one metric can coincide with low values in another. Most importantly, I show that integrated systematic conservation planning, rather than congruence metrics, is the only way to determine how efficient it will be to protect multiple features in a reserve system. While conservation planning has an implicit goal of cost-efficiency, spatially explicit data on the costs of conservation action are rarely considered. Prioritisation analyses that do not consider conservation costs can lead to the misallocation of funds and high opportunity costs. In Chapter 4 I carry out a global analysis at 1&#186; resolution to identify areas that could protect targets of 10% of every mammal species&#8217; range whilst minimising the opportunity costs of forgone agricultural production. The a priori inclusion of opportunity costs reduced the cost of meeting conservation targets by at least 30%. I then compare cost-effective allocation of funds to actual funding allocation by international conservation agencies in 2006, highlighting globally important, threatened and under-funded regions. While estimates of conservation opportunity costs can increase conservation planning efficiency, there are often various actions under consideration, each with different associated costs. The definition of specific actions, and their respective costs, is rarely considered in conservation planning. In Chapter 5 I develop cost surfaces for two conservation actions in Australia (i) land purchase for reservation estimated by unimproved land values and (ii) stewardship payments to private landholders to conserve biodiversity estimated by forgone agricultural production. I then identify priority areas at a 10 km2 resolution for conserving 15% of the pre-clearing extent of a range of biodiversity features by these actions. I demonstrate that using cost data to reflect specific conservation actions minimises improves financial efficiency by up to two-fold. Cost-effective conservation planning is also hindered by uncertainties in estimates of conservation costs. In Chapter 6 I carry out the first comprehensive sensitivity analysis of conservation priorities to cost value, using the same goal as in Chapter 5, but restricting planning to reservation in Queensland, which is the Australian state with the best quality unimproved land value data. First, I show that sites which are essential or unhelpful for meeting conservation targets maintain a high and low priority status respectively, over a large range of cost data (1-400% of their estimated cost). Medium priority sites are sensitive to estimates of cost, and represent the greatest opportunities to make cost-effective decisions. Next I develop a simple approach for planning with uncertain cost data, where priorities can be updated as real information on the cost of a parcel of land becomes available. This chapter shows that uncertain cost data is useful for conservation planning. Potentially cost-effective areas for conservation actions in Australia are identified in Chapters 5 and 6. My final chapter serves to synthesise and interpret this research. Through comprehensive analyses, I have shown that cost-effective conservation planning requires the definition of appropriate objectives and tools, and the integration of conservation costs. Further, I have demonstrated accessible approaches that integrate these crucial factors, showing at least a doubling of efficiency in conservation investments. There are cost-effective opportunities for conservation actions in Australia and around the world: this research will assist Governments, Non-Government Organisations, and other conservation-minded people in finding them. Further investment is required in obtaining and wisely applying socio-economic data for conservation planning and in evaluating conservation projects to improve our knowledge base.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systematic conservation planning</field><field name="subject">priority setting</field><field name="subject">Decision Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods</field><field name="creator">Kiki Fibrianto</field><field name="description">Sorption Behaviour of Selected Dairy Powder Mixtures: A Study of The Effects of Composition and Mixing Methods Abstract As water mediates physico-chemical reactions (i.e. Maillard reactions, phase changes of sugars and minerals, protein conformational changes), water-powder interactions during storage are critical for dairy powder stability. Therefore, the mechanisms of moisture adsorption from the environment and water distribution among components in the dry state need to be investigated, especially in mixed systems. In order to achieve this goal, the research reported in this thesis had two key objectives. The first was to examine the effect of the sorption properties and phase changes of individual components in relation to the sorption properties of the mixed system. This was achieved by adding three level concentrations of lactose and mineral rich dairy powder (10, 20 and 30%) to Milk Protein Concentrate containing 85% of protein (MPC-85). The second objective was to examine the effect of mixing methods on the sorption behaviour of mixed systems, by applying two different mixing methods, solution mixing and mechanical mixing (particulate mixing). In the solution mixing method, the components were mixed in the same water and then spray dried. In the mechanical mixing method, two individual powder components were physically mixed. For both mixed systems, the kinetics of moisture adsorption were determined at 4 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (22.5, 43.2, 65.4 and 84.3%) and the final equilibrium moisture contents were determined at 8 different equilibrium relative humidity levels (11.3, 22.5, 32.8, 43.2, 52.9, 65.4, 75.3 and 84.3%) at 25&#176;C. The effect of lactose addition to the MPC powder tended to retard the moisture sorption of the mixtures. The increase of concentration level of the lactose that was introduced to the MPC system, through either solution or mechanical mixing, resulted in less moisture adsorption when compared to MPC itself (p-value&lt;0.05). This effect tended to be greater with the increase in relative humidity. A similar effect was observed for MPC/mineral rich milk calcium powder (MC) mixtures. The application of different mixing methods modified the equilibrium moisture content of MPC/Lactose mixtures, even though both mixing methods resulted in similar monolayer moisture value. The monolayer moisture values calculated for both mixing methods were significantly lower than their theoretical values (p-value&lt; 0.05). This suggested that a lactose-protein interaction might exist in both powders prepared by solution and mechanical mixing. Even though the interaction itself is hypothetical, the effect of interaction could be reflected by significant different adsorption rate (p-value &lt; 0.05) of powders produced by different mixing method. A similar type of interaction might exist for the solution mixed MPC/MC system, even though different results were obtained for MPC/MC mixtures prepared by mechanical mixing. The addition of lactose to MPC tended to slow the rate of moisture adsorption. This deceleration might have been contributed to by a reduction of the protein hydration sites by the association of lactose molecules to these sites. In contrast to the MPC/lactose system, the addition of mineral rich MC powder to MPC did not significantly change the rate of adsorption (p-value&lt;0.05). Different mixing methods were found to change the rate of moisture adsorption for the MPC/Lactose systems (p-value&lt;0.05). Even though the mechanically mixed powder adsorbed faster than that of solution mixed powder and X-Ray measurement indicated lactose crystal formation, a drop of moisture during the sorption study was not observed. This suggests that water released during crystallisation might be adsorbed by protein. Meanwhile, the application of two different mixing methods did not modify adsorption rate of MPC/MC system, except for samples stored at RH 84.3%. At this environment, mechanically mixed MPC/MC powders were adsorbed more slowly than the solution mixed powder (p-value&lt;0.05). It might reflect powder compaction or a collapse of the porous structure, leading to limited moisture transfer at the interface. Lactose proportions and different mixing methods influenced the glass-rubber transition temperature (Tg-r) of the MPC/Lactose mixtures. An increase in the proportion of lactose tended to depress Tg-r of the mixtures (p-value&lt;0.05). The Tg-r of the mechanically mixed powder was lower than that of solution mixed powder, presumably on account of the Tg-r for mechanically mixed powder being dominated by phase separated sugar components. Meanwhile, the Tg-r of MPC/MC mixtures was not influenced by either MC proportion or mixing method, particularly for samples stored at below RH 65.4%. The XRD-pattern suggested that the crystal formed during storage of MPC/Lactose mixtures was &#945;-lactose monohydrate. As confirmed by XRD, a drop in moisture for the mixture corresponded to the presence of a peak in the XRD pattern, except for mechanically mixed powder. In this type of powder, even though a peak was detected, a moisture drop was not observed. Within the sensitivity limits of XRD, a crystalline form was not observed for MPC/MC mixtures.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Keywords {sorption isotherm, sorption kinetic, phase changes, composition, mixing method, MPC-85, lactose, mineral rich powder}</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Development of ESL Collocational Knowledge</field><field name="creator">Gitsaki, Christina</field><field name="description">This study examines the development of collocational knowledge in learners of ESL. A number of previous studies have underscored the importance of collocations for L2 acquisition, and the problems that learners face with learning and using collocations. However, there have been few attempts to systematically study how the development of collocational knowledge relates to the overall development of language proficiency with a particular intention in identifying possible stages in the development of L2 collocational knowledge. This study adopts a structure-based framework for the study of collocations based on previous studies (Zhang 1993; Biscup 1992) and the BBI Combinatory Dictionary of English, and attempts to describe how collocational knowledge develops across different language proficiency levels with respect to 37 collocation types. Data were collected from 275 Greek learners of ESL at three proficiency levels (post-beginners, intermediate, and post-intermediate) using three tasks: essay writing, translation test, and blank-filling. The essay writing provided evidence of accurate free production of collocations, while the translation and blank-filling tests measured accuracy in the subjects&#8217; knowledge of collocations in cued production tasks. The data were examined with respect to the between- and within-group differences in accuracy on all three dependent measures. Statistical measures were employed to determine the significance of the observed between-group and within-group differences, and implicational scaling analyses was used to reveal accuracy orders in the acquisition of collocations. Results show that there are patterns of development of collocational knowledge across and within the different proficiency groups for both the free and the cued production data. Collocational knowledge was shown to increase steadily as the level of proficiency increased, and there were group-specific accuracy orders showing that grammatical collocations are easier to acquire than lexical collocations. The development of collocational knowledge was found to be influenced by the syntactic complexity of the collocation types, and also by exposure and maturation. Finally, three stages for the development of collocational knowledge are proposed. In the first stage learners acquire collocations as unanalysed lexical items, and hence the learners are more accurate with lexical collocations than complex grammatical ones. At the second stage the learners' grammatical knowledge develops enabling learners to use complex grammatical collocations with greater accuracy than in stage one. At the third stage of collocational development, learners are able to use both grammatical and lexical collocations with greater accuracy than in the other two stages, and they are on their way to a more advanced level of collocational knowledge.

The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

I argue that if private benefits are a motivation for mergers and acquisitions, an acquirer is more likely to bid for a controlling fraction (but not a hundred percent) of a target firm in countries with weak investor protection because in these countries private benefits of control are an important asset. The empirical results support this argument: compared to full mergers, partial acquisitions are the preferred form of acquisition when target countries do not effectively protect minority investors. Partial acquisitions are also more common among foreign acquirers from countries with poor legal systems. Finally, I show that firm-level corporate governance of the target firm is negatively related to the likelihood of partial acquisition. The second study examines the effect of investor protection on domestic liquidity for cross-listed firms. If US cross-listing can improve a firm&#8217;s information environment because of more stringent disclosure requirements in the US, I expect the information improvement to be reflected in a reduction in domestic liquidity costs. The empirical results are consistent with this prediction: local bid-ask spreads and price impact (a proxy for the cost of adverse information) significantly decrease while local trading volume significantly increases one year after US cross-listing. In addition, the liquidity improvement is larger for cross-listed firms that are from poor investor protection countries, and that are listed on the NYSE. The results in the second study are consistent with the &#8220;bonding&#8221; argument by Coffee (2002). The third study tests Coffee&#8217;s (1999) prediction of a convergence in corporate governance around the world. Since information environment is a key factor of corporate governance, it is important to see if there is a convergence in information environment across countries over the past two decades. Using various common proxies for information environment, I show that the quality of information environment generally improves through time, but the improvement is larger for developed markets and countries with better institutional quality. In the third study, I also reproduce the main results in Bailey, Karolyi and Salva (2006), and Fernandes and Ferreira (2008). These studies report similar divergence in information environment for cross-listed firms post-US-listing, but fail to control for the quality of information environment in the domestic market. After we control for this market effect, we do not find support for their results: there is no improvement in information environment for cross-listed firms, and no difference in the change between developed and emerging countries.  1 The second and third empirical studies are co-authored work with my supervisor, Professor Henk Berkman.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art and disssensus : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Fine Art at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ting, Michael Arthur</field><field name="description">For a contemporary art practice, what does it mean to resist? This essay will discuss the idea of resistance in the present day using the work of Karl Marx as the key starting point. If he is foundational to the understanding of capitalism, then later philosophers such as Frederic Jameson and Jacques Ranciere have added considerably to the relevance of Marx, and added their own critical engagement with the art world. Ranciere advocates dissensus, which he sees as being counter to the conformity that liberalism and concensus bring. Political philosopher Chantal Mouffe also advocates dissensus, replacing antagonism with the idea of agonism. There is disagreement but as in sport both parties recognize the legitimacy of their opponent. This is why identity is so important to democracy, for without difference there is no real choice, and so the nature of identity and the subject become crucial factors in conceiving of a way to resist, and a way of being as an artist.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resistance in art</field><field name="subject">Dissension</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1324</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Arteries of Empire: An operational study of transport and communication in Angkorian Southeast Asia (9th to 15th centuries CE)</field><field name="creator">Hendrickson, Mitch</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosphy(PhD)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Angkor</field><field name="subject">Roads</field><field name="subject">Khmer Empire</field><field name="subject">Operational Theory</field><field name="subject">Transport Geography</field><field name="subject">Medieval Southeast Asia</field><field name="subject">Road System</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Narrative Form and Mediaeval Continuity In The Percy Folio Manuscript: A Study Of Selected Poems</field><field name="creator">St. Clair-Kendall, S.

Acknowledgement of the need for midwife-led models of care in state maternity service policies provided opportunities for midwives to become recognised within the healthcare system and the wider community. This professional doctorate aims to examine the ways in which the role of the midwife and her practice has been impacted on by organisational renovations of midwifery care. It identifies the complexity of the factors that affect the midwife&#8217;s ability or choice to work in midwife-led models of care. Furthermore this doctorate highlights the need for ongoing debate into midwifery in Australia. Concepts related to midwifery practice are examined as they form the foundations for the research and policy components of the portfolio. This includes an exploration of midwifery philosophy, the antecedents to autonomous practice and the experience midwives have of midwife-led care. An examination of the concepts of continuity of care and woman-centred care provides a platform upon which to review models of midwifery care. This review highlights the development of an ongoing relationship as a source of satisfaction for midwives and women. The second part of the doctorate reviews policies that guide the provision of maternity services in Victoria. Analysis of these policies using Kingdon&#8217;s multiple streams framework identifies the problems, the political actors and the policy developed, establishing the context for organisational change in maternity care. The antecedents for successful integration of organisational change are explored through a review of change theory and leadership. A case study approach utilised for the research component of the doctorate provides insights into organisational change that occurred at two maternity sites in Victoria. The findings of the study suggest there was a dichotomy between those midwives desiring autonomous practice and wanting to work in midwife-led care and those wishing to remain in one specialised area. Recommendations stemming from these findings include the need for sufficient education and support during change, a review of terminology used to describe midwifery models of care and research into the use of integrated maternity units. Complexity science is examined in order to bring the different strands of the doctorate together, providing an explanation for the different outcomes that occur despite the implementation of similar models. The connective leadership model was suggested as the means to provide leadership that is inclusive of providing direction, mentoring new leaders and providing support and opportunities for midwives to become empowered to practice autonomously. Attention to the complexity of organisational change is vital to ensure the future of midwifery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery.</field><field name="subject">Organizational change.</field><field name="subject">Midwives.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond words: newly-arrived children's perceptions of music learning and music making</field><field name="creator">Howell, Gillian</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the way refugee and immigrant children, newly-arrived in Australia, perceive and describe music learning and music making.

Despite this, debate continues on what constitutes a bioavailable pool and how to best predict bioavailability, especially in relation to crop plants. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess and validate measures of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) bioavailability in a range of soils amended with metal salts and biosolids. Six potential measures of bioavailability were investigated and compared: total metal; 0.04 M EDTA extraction; 0.05 M Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; extraction; soil solution extracted using rhizon probes; effective solution concentration (CE) determined using diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT); and modelled free ion activities (WHAM 6.0). These were compared to shoot metal concentrations obtained from plants grown in three soils with contrasting properties treated with biosolids and metal salts. The first study involved a wheat seedling (Triticum aestivum) assay carried out under controlled environmental conditions on incubated soils treated with metal salts and biosolids. Results showed that the presence of biosolids resulted in increases of DOC, salinity, Ca and Mg in soil solution as well as total concentrations of Cu and Zn, dry matter was also adversely affected by increased levels of salinity. The addition of biosolids did not significantly alter the extractability or solubility of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn although concentrations of Cd in shoots were significantly lower in plants grown in biosolids amended soils compared with unamended soils. The second study involved a field experiment that used 20 cm diameter by 30 cm deep soil monoliths of the same three soils treated with metals and biosolids, and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) was grown for 24 months. Results revealed the addition of biosolids significantly increased the amount of DOC, salinity, Ca and Mg in solution. The presence of biosolids also significantly altered the bioavailability of Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn, as measured by soil solution, CE and free ion activity. However, this change had little effect on plant metal uptake. The length of time following treatment application had the greatest effect on soil chemistry and metal availability, resulting in pH decreases and increases in DOC, soil solution salinity, Ca and Mg. The free ion activities of each metal increased with time, as did soil solution Cd and Zn and CE-Cu, with results for Zn indicative of migration through the soil profile with time. Plant uptake of Ni and Zn also changed with time. Nickel concentrations in shoots decreased, while concentrations of Zn in shoots increased. The findings from the two studies demonstrated that biosolids increased the amount of DOC, salinity, Ca and Mg present in soil solution. In the lysimeter study measures of metal availability were affected in soils amended with biosolids, but this did not effect shoot concentrations. The overall predictive strengths of the six potential measures of bioavailability was investigated using results from the previously described experiments and related studies carried out by ESR and Lincoln University using nine different soils amended with combinations of biosolids and metal salts. Of the four metals Ni provided the strongest correlations between metal bioavailability and shoot concentrations, with 0.05 M Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; extraction giving the strongest relationship for Ni concentrations in shoots (r&#178; = 0.73). This suggests that the solubility of Ni is highly indicative of shoot concentrations and that Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; is a robust measure of Ni bioavailability. In addition Ca(NO&#8323;)&#8322; provided the best estimate of Zn bioavailability (r&#178; = 0.65), and CE-Cd provided the best measure of Cd bioavailability, although it could only describe 47 % of shoot Cd concentration. Results for Cu were typical of previously described studies as assays of Cu availability are almost always poorly correlated with shoot concentrations, with total Cu having the strongest relationship (r&#178; = 0.34). Methods based on the extractability and solubility of Cu in soils were poor indicators of Cu concentration in shoots. Overall, the addition of biosolids did not alter the outcome of these bioavailability assays, and results indicated that total metal concentrations present in the soils and biosolids matrix, plus length of time since soil treatment, had a greater affect on metal bioavailability.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bioavailability</field><field name="subject">soils</field><field name="subject">cadmium</field><field name="subject">copper</field><field name="subject">nickel</field><field name="subject">zinc</field><field name="subject">ryegrass</field><field name="subject">wheat</field><field name="subject">biosolids</field><field name="subject">Triticum aestivum L.</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300103 Soil chemistry</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300102 Soil biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of imperfect mixing in suspended plant and animal cell cultures</field><field name="creator">Cheung, Caleb Kin Lok, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A common problem observed in large-scale cell cultivation is reduced culture performance compared with small-scale processes due to the existence of concentration gradients caused by poor mixing. Small-scale simulations using microbial cell suspensions have shown that circulation of cells through concentration gradients of oxygen, pH and glucose can result in reduction of cell growth and product formation similar to the effects observed in large-scale bioreactors. This study was aimed at using scale-down studies to investigate poor mixing in large-scale bioreactors used for suspended plant and animal cell culture. Two plant cell suspensions and a hybridoma cell line were used in this work. The range of oxygen transfer coefficients achieved in the hybridoma and plant suspensions were about 50???20 h-1 and 12???6 h-1, respectively. One-vessel simulation was developed to induce fluctuations of dissolved oxygen tension in a 2-L bioreactor using intermittent sparging of air and nitrogen. The effect of dissolved oxygen fluctuations on the cells was examined by comparing the performance of the cultures with those operated at constant dissolved oxygen tension. In the hybridoma suspension culture, only slight effects on cell growth were observed at circulation times above 300 s. No effect on the specific glucose uptake rate or antibody production was observed at the circulation times tested. Analysis of gene expression for selected hypoxia-related genes also suggested that the overall effect was limited. In plant cell suspensions, the specific growth rates and biomass yields on total sugar in the cultures under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension were essentially the same as those at constant dissolved oxygen tension for both transgenic Nicotiana tabacum and Thalictrum minus. Under fluctuating dissolved oxygen tension, no effect on antibody accumulation was observed in transgenic N. tabacum suspensions, but a decrease in berberine accumulation was observed in T. minus. From the results, it can be concluded that only minimal effects due to the development of concentration gradients would be expected in large-scale bioreactors used for the cultivation of the hybridoma and plant cell suspensions tested in this work.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Animal cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Plant cell biotechnology</field><field name="subject">Cell culture</field><field name="subject">Bioreactors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling and characterization of multipath fading channels in cellular mobile communication systems</field><field name="creator">Khan, Noor Muhammad, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to the enormous capacity and performance gains associated with the use of antenna arrays in wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication links, it is inevitable that these technologies will become an integral part of future systems. In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scratch-pad memory management for static data aggregates</field><field name="creator">Li, Lian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scratch-pad memory (SPM), a fast on-chip SRAM managed by software, is widely used in embedded systems. Compared to hardware-managed cache, SPM can be more efficient in performance, power and area cost, and has the added advantage of better time predictability. In this thesis, SPMs should be seen in a general context. For example, in stream processors, a software-managed stream register file is usually used to stage data to and from off-chip memory. In IBM's Cell architecture, each co-processor has a software-managed local store for keeping data and instructions.  SPM management is critical for SPM-based embedded systems. In this thesis, we propose two novel methodologies, the memory colouring methodology and the perfect colouring methodology, to place the static data aggregates such as arrays and structs of a program in SPM. Our methodologies are dynamic in the sense that some data aggregates can be swapped into and out of SPM during program execution. To this end, a live range splitting heuristic is introduced in order to create potential data transfer statements between SPM and off-chip memory.  The memory colouring methodology is a general-purpose compiler approach. The novelty of this approach lies in partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file then generalising existing graph colouring algorithms for register allocation to colour data aggregates. In this thesis, a scheme for partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file is introduced. This methodology is inter-procedural and therefore operates on the interference graph for the data aggregates in the whole program. Different graph colouring algorithms may give rise to different results due to live range splitting and spilling heuristics used. As a result, two representative graph colouring algorithms, George and Appel's iterative-coalescing and Park and Moon's optimistic-coalescing, are generalised and evaluated for SPM allocation.  Like memory colouring, perfect colouring is also inter-procedural. The novelty of this second methodology lies in formulating the SPM allocation problem as an interval colouring problem. The interval colouring problem is an NP problem and no widely-accepted approximation algorithms exist. The key observation is that the interference graphs for data aggregates in many embedded applications form a special class of superperfect graphs. This has led to the development of two additional SPM allocation algorithms. While differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together, both algorithms place data aggregates in SPM based on the cliques in an interference graph. In both cases, we guarantee optimally that all data aggregates in an interference graph can be placed in SPM if the given SPM size is no smaller than the chromatic number of the graph.  We have developed two memory colouring algorithms and two perfect colouring algorithms for SPM allocation. We have evaluated them using a set of embedded applications. Our results show that both methodologies are efficient and effective in handling large-scale embedded applications. While neither methodology outperforms the other consistently, perfect colouring has yielded better overall results in the set of benchmarks used in our experiments. All these algorithms are expected to be valuable. For example, they can be made available as part of the same compiler framework to assist the embedded designer with exploring a large number of optimisation opportunities for a particular embedded application.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scratch-pad memory.</field><field name="subject">Compiler.</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Telepathy in contemporary, conceptual and performance art</field><field name="creator">Drinkall, Jacquelene Ashley, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of telepathy and psi on conceptual and performance art from 1968. Emerging from the author???s art practice, the thesis argues telepathy is a key leitmotif and creative concern within much post 60s art, and has become central to the practice of a number of contemporary video, performance and new media artists. This thesis is composed of two interrelated parts: an exhibition of the artwork by the author concerning telepathic processes, and a written project which uses the major themes of the exhibition to frame an historical study of a number of key contemporary artists whom, it is argued, work with telepathy. These artists, Jane and Louise Wilson, Suzanne Treister and Susan Hiller are discussed under the themes of ???twinning and doubling,??? ???technological mediums??? and ???telepathy experiments???. These themes also overlap in the authors artwork, are introduced through an overarching analysis of the work of performance artist Marina Abramovi?? and philosopher Jacques Derrida who, it is argued, provide a new model of telepathy as an art practice. In addition, the thesis argues that telepathy is an often suppressed thematic in art which may not appear to directly address it, and uses the work on the Wilsons, Treister and Hiller to re-look at other 20th Century artists and artistic themes in the light of the conclusions it draws on telepathy and art. Walter Benjamin greatly admired the Surrealists, but had virtually no time for their interest in telepathy, hypnosis and psi. Together with positive materialist misappropriations of Adorno???s Thesis Against Occultism, artistic and theoretical work with telepathy and psi has been sidelined from other important themes in art and critical theory, all of which telepathy and psi illuminate, energise and empower. The art of the author and other more recognised and established artists can be seen to work with telepathy in ways that flow into and reinforce the grain of progressive leftist practice and aesthetics. Women???s work with telepathy should be considered as important as women???s work with sexuality. Women, sexuality, Otherness, liminality, spirituality, telepathy, trauma, healing, radical politics, and other taboo areas of patriachal codes, were adandoned by macho participants of fluxus and Conceptual art. The recent conceptual and performance tilt in contemporary art sheds new light on the problem of working within and developing an effective and dynamic lineage of telepathy in post 60s art as well as early modern art movements. Contemporary developments in science, engineering, biology, psychoanalysis, warfare, popular culture and sociology show the wider relevance of discourse on telepathy. There is much at stake for visual art, aesthetics and visuality in representing, celebrating and interrogating the theme of psi and telepathy in current practice and art history. Artists??? work with telepathy and psi, although not always explicitly psychological, political or aesthetic, is often very psychologically, politically and aesthetically effective.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telepathy</field><field name="subject">modern art</field><field name="subject">performance art</field><field name="subject">conceptual art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of performance measurement of safety systems in construction.</field><field name="creator">Naik, Nitin, CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Australia, the measurement of safety performance in the construction industry has mostly been in response to statutory requirements. Consequently, the measures and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used by the industry have invariably focused on outcomes rather than processes. Most of the outcome indicators have tended to give their feedback well after the event therefore failing to identify any weaknesses within the safety management processes. In order to overcome these limitations, two hospital construction projects in New South Wales were selected for an in-depth study and research analysis. The aim of the research was to understand the relationship between management process intervention and management process outcomes for safety in the construction industry. Initially a literature review identifying international practices in performance measurement for safety in construction was conducted so as to review existing safety management processes in partnership with the construction industry representatives.  A framework for measuring the performance of safety management processes and related outcomes was developed to stimulate improvement on both projects through the comparison of the performance of the safety management systems and outcomes.  This framework was then implemented and established to monitor the performance of the key safety management processes. The successful implementation of the performance measurement framework and the feedback to both stakeholders and subcontractors acted as a good communication tool in creating awareness among subcontractors.  It also helped to reduce repetitive hazards, resulting in improved safety outcomes. A statistical analysis found that relatively few injuries were explained by the identified safety hazards.  This highlighted the need to look for hazards that were specifically relate to injury occurrence.  The research findings identified a method for improving the existing hazard identification process.  It is anticipated that such improvements can help to better correlate hazard management processes with the project outcomes for safety in future projects.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SAFETY SYSTEMS</field><field name="subject">PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT</field><field name="subject">CONSTRUCTION</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing brush: an exploration of Taoist aesthetics</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Yi-Lan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dancing Brush video installation is dedicated to legendary Taiwanese dancer Tsai Jui-Yue (1921-2005) in the memory of her suffering, creativity and faith in life. This work reveals the true meaning of Chinese scroll paintings as an infinity of time and space. It draws on the notion of mobility as expounded in the I Ching or Book of Changes. Dancing Brush creates a modern cityscape where the principal of Taoism, ancient Chinese landscape painting, and calligraphy meet new media aesthetics. The focus of this thesis is to reassess media arts practice and aesthetics via the traditions of Chinese Taoist aesthetics. The research was conducted in three dimensions: ??non-linear aesthetics?? in Chinese arts as the new media art form, ??unity of emptiness and fullness?? as the animation principle, and ??subtraction aesthetics?? as the principle of creativity. I propose Dancing Brush video installation as a presentation of ??aesthetics of wandering contemplation??. The work suggests a feature of Chinese moving image aesthetics as a ??spatial montage?? form of media arts. I applied the Taoist ??decreative-creative process?? as the creative method in which the ??decreative?? process leads to the ??creative??. The ??decreative-creative process?? is based on the Taoist teachings of zi-ran (spontaneity) and wu-wei (non-action). I interpret it as ??subtraction aesthetics: less is more??. The process is to eliminate interferences with restricted narrative format and visual effects, then to receive the immediate presentation of things as pure materials. Through the subtracting process, it gains not less but more. Kong Bai (emptiness or formless) in Chinese art is the result of subtraction aesthetics. It reveals the creative principle derived from the Taoist idea of ??usefulness of useless??. The ??subtracting process?? in creating animation is to bring ??unknown?? to life. The ??image beyond image?? is the product of ??unity of emptiness and full?? where Chinese artistic realm yi-jing is created.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Taoist Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">subtractions aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Australian's in Greece and Crete : a study of an intimate wartime relationship</field><field name="creator">Hill, Maria, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Historians have largely ignored the importance of relationships in war, particularly at a grass roots level. Examining the past from a relational point of view provides a new perspective on war not accessible through other forms of analysis. A relational approach to a study of the campaigns in Greece and Crete helps to explain, amongst other issues, why so many Australian lives were saved.  Australians entered Greece with little background knowledge of the country and the people they were required to defend. There was no serious consultation with the Australian government apart from the cursory briefing of its Prime Minister. Although Britain had numerous intelligence officers operating on the ground in Greece prior and during the campaign, little information about the true political situation in the country had filtered through to the Australian high command. This placed the troops in a very vulnerable position on the Greek frontier and, later, on Crete.  Military interaction with the Greeks proved difficult, as key officers from the Greek General Staff and senior government ministers did not intend to fight the Germans. As a result, little coordination took place between the Australian and Greek forces hindering the development of a successful working relationship. Conversely, relations with the Greek people were very amicable with many Greeks risking their lives to help Australian troops.  The altruism of the Greeks was one of the most striking features of the Greek and Crete campaigns. Unlike Egypt, where the Australians felt alienated by the values and customs of the Egyptian people, in Greece they warmed to the behaviour of the Greeks. Although they did not speak the same language nor share a similar culture, they had many characteristics in common with the Greeks whose strong sense of loyalty to their allies really impressed the Australians. On their part, the Australians displayed respect for the values and customs of the Greek people.  Through their interaction during the war, the Greeks came to regard the Australians, not only as friends, but also as brothers, forging an intimate relationship that has been incorporated in the social memory of both countries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian and Greece : Foreign Relations</field><field name="subject">World War, 1939-1945 : Campaigns : Greece</field><field name="subject">Australia and Greece :  Military Relations</field><field name="subject">Australian Army : Serving in Greece</field><field name="subject">Australian politics 1941-1945..</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating five models of dissemination of NHMRC 'Guideline depression in young people for GP's' through divisions of general practice</field><field name="creator">Penrose-Wall, Jonine., Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Dissemination of evidence-based mental health clinical practice guidelines had not been studied in Australia prior to the National General Practice Guideline Implementation Program. This naturalistic research reports ten national interventions designed to disseminate the NHMRC 1997 Clinical Practice Guideline Depression in Young People for GPs (GDIYP-GP) through 123 Divisions of General Practice. The guideline covered depression and suicide in young people aged 13 to 20 years. Aim: To evaluate a 'coordinated link agent' and 'enhanced packaged approach' for disseminating a national guideline by engaging 20 Divisions in using 5 dissemination models and to measure Divisions' capacities in performing unfunded local dissemination to GPs. Method: An Implementation Kit was the main national intervention, housing the guidelines and 5 models: Education by the Division; Education by an external provider; 3) Clinical Audit; 4) Segmented Formats and 5) Appraisal. Five studies are reported: 1) an organisational census on guideline-related practices in all topics; 2) a Case Study Database of 3 consecutive interviews of 51 participating Divisions; 3) a Guideline Appraisal study of 9 cohorts of doctors; 4) a Clinical Audit study of 54 doctors involving 1200 patients; and 5) a 'Segmented Formats' documentary analysis of Division communications on GDIYP-GP. Results: Prior dissemination by most Divisions was administrative mail outs rather than planned programs. In all, 70 instead of the pilot 20 organisations participated (57% of the sector) using 10,000 guidelines: 45 participated by 7 weeks and 71 by 35 weeks and the majority used multiple active strategies showing fidelity to the Kit. Education by the Division, Segmented Formats and Appraisal were the most adopted models. GDIYP-GP was acceptable and relevant to the majority of Divisions and to 9 samples of doctors. Conclusion: Divisions are one appropriate system through which evidence-based mental health guidelines can be disseminated to general practitioners. Uptake can be rapid using a flexible enhanced package approach with link-agent support. 3-6 months is needed for organisations to begin effective interventions.

Since many S. marcecens strains are also resistant to multiple antibiotics, this organism represents a growing public health problem.  S. marcescens MG1 utilises a regulatory system for regulation of swarming motility and exo-enzyme secretion that relies on the production of a diffusible signal identified as N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL).  The aim of this study was to determine the role of C4-HSL in surface colonisation (adhesion and biofilm formation).  In this thesis, the development of a novel biofilm in S. marcescens MG1 is described.  The biofilm comprises of an intricate and complex structure consisting of long filamentous cells, cell aggregates and cell chains.  Two C4-HSL controlled genes (bsmA and bsmB) are shown to be crucial for biofilm formation.  It is proposed that C4-HSL regulated bsmA and bsmB gene products are engaged in fine tuning aggregation at a specific time point in late biofilm development.  Since adhesion is the first stage of colonisation, the role of C4-HSL in adhesion to a hydrophilic abiotic surface (HAS) and a human corneal epithelial (HCE) cell line was assessed.  While adhesion to the HAS was found to be C4-HSL controlled, this was not the case for adhesion to the HCE cells.  In adhesion to the HAS, mutations in the following C4-HSL regulated genes resulted in reduced adhesion; a sensor kinase gene (rssA), a type I transporter gene (lipB), bsmA and bsmB.  These four genes were found to effect the expression of type I fimbriae which is proposed to be the adhesin affecting C4-HSL regulated adhesion.  While C4-HSL is not involved in adhesion to the HCE cell line, the genes bsmA and bsmB are important.  It is proposed that bsmA and bsmB dependent HCE adhesion is due to the requirement of these genes for type I fimbriae production.  Furthermore, C4-HSL was found to regulate capsule polysaccharide and OmpX production and repress cytotoxic activity against HCE cells and erythrocytes. It is proposed that cytotoxicity is mediated by ShlA haemolysin.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofilm</field><field name="subject">Adhesion</field><field name="subject">Serratia marcescens</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coal bed methane reservoir simulation studies</field><field name="creator">Karimi, Kaveh, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to perform simulation studies for a specific coal bed methane reservoir. First, the theory and reservoir engineering aspects of coal bed methane reservoirs, such as dual porosity concept, permeability characteristics of CBM reservoirs and mechanism of gas storage and gas transportation in CBM reservoir have been discussed. Next, simulation results for the CBM reservoir presented. Simulation studies were carried out by using the CBM reservoir simulator, SIMED II. Injection/fall-off test pressure data were interpreted based on the pressure history matching method. The interpretation results include the determination of reservoir permeability and identification of the reservoir altered zone. Also available production histories were used to simulate the reservoir production behavior. Then the production model was used to predict the reservoir future production and to carry out sensitivity analysis on reservoir performance. For natural pressure depletion, methane recovery was increased significantly as reservoir permeability was increased. Well-bore fracturing creates a fractured zone with higher permeability. This increases methane production rate during early time of reservoir life. Reservoir matrix porosity has a significant effect on the reservoir performance. Higher production peak rate and also higher methane recovery was obtained for the reservoir with lower porosity values. Any increase in the reservoir compressibility causes greater reduction in reservoir absolute permeability as well as relative permeability to gas throughout the reservoir. Therefore, methane recovery decreased as the reservoir compressibility increased. The reservoir production behavior was strongly affected by changes in reservoir size. The production peak rate was significantly postponed and lowered as reservoir size was increased. The effect of reservoir initial pressure was investigated and the results show that higher initial reservoir pressure leads to higher production rate during early years of production. However, for the later years of reservoir life, the production profile is almost identical for different initial pressures. Coal desorption time constant affects the methane production by its own scale. In this study, the range of desorption time did not exceed longer than three days and therefore the difference in production rate was observed only in the first few days of production.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">coalbed methane</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion. The findings from this thesis provide insights on tacit collusion in an oligopoly and policy implications from a learning perspective. With modelling flexibility, our co-evolutionary approach can be extended to study strategic behaviour in an oligopoly considering many other market characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Price fixing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Finance -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Oligopolies -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex, drugs and 'ugly mugs': an ethnographic study of women who inject psychostimulants and engage in street-based sex work in Kings Cross, Sydney.</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Susan Lee, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australian and international literature provides strong evidence that intravenous use of psychostimulants increases the harms experienced by users, including heightening the risk of blood-borne virus (BBV) infection. The few Australian studies that include women who inject psychostimulants identify street-based sex work as the main method of income generation and highlight the harms that result from combining these practices. However, there has been little exploration into the way these practices are shaped by the environments in which they occur or the ways in which women manage these harms. This thesis aims to provide an in-depth exploration of the daily lives of women who inject psychostimulants and engage in street-based sex work in Kings Cross, Sydney. Over 18 months between 2005 and 2007, the author conducted ethnographic fieldwork with women who injected psychostimulants and engaged in street-based sex work in Kings Cross, Sydney. Data sources included observations recorded as fieldnotes and transcripts of in-depth interviews with 12 women. Thematic analysis of the data was employed with particular attention to the women???s shared narratives. Key findings of the thesis were that 1) the Kings Cross environment plays a prominent role in shaping the lives of women, their psychostimulant injecting and street-based sex work practices; 2) psychostimulant injecting reinforces the opportunistic nature of street-based sex work as the primary method of income generating for women, restricting the development of occupational norms; 3) synergies exist between the drug and sex markets in Kings Cross, increasing the harms associated with both injecting and street-based sex work practices; 4) public health messages relating to sharing of injecting equipment and condom use fail to account for contextually driven decision-making and risk prioritising; 5) women develop lay epidemiological understandings as they attempt to reconcile the public health messages with the lived reality. The value of these findings is in the insights they provide into the everyday lives of these women in Kings Cross that have not been documented previously and their potential for informing ???bottom-up??? rather than ???top down??? approaches to future policy, practice and research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Injecting drug use</field><field name="subject">Psychostimulants</field><field name="subject">Sex work</field><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Kings Cross</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Secure network programming in wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Tan, Hailun, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Network programming is one of the most important applications in Wireless Sensor Networks as It provides an efficient way to update program Images running on sensor nodes without physical access to them. Securing these updates, however, remains a challenging and important issue, given the open deployment environment of sensor nodes. Though several security schemes have been proposed to impose the authenticity and Integrity protection on network programming applications, they are either energy Inefficient as they tend to use digital signature or lacks the data confidentiality. In addition, due to the absence of secure memory management in the current sensor hardware, the attacker could inject malicious code into the program flash by exploiting buffer overflow In the memory despite the secure code dissemination.  The contribution of this thesis Is to provide two software-based security protocols and one hardware-based remote attestation protocol for network programming application.  Our first protocol deploys multiple one-way key chains for a multi-hop sensor network. The scheme Is shown to be lower In computational, power consumption and communication costs yet still able to secure multi??hop propagation of program images.  Our second protocol utilizes an Iterative hash structure to the data packets in network programming application, ensuring the data confidentiality and authenticity. In addition, we Integrated confidentiality and DoS-attack-resistance in a multi??hop code dissemination protocol.  Our final solution is a hardware-based remote attestation protocol for verification of running codes on sensor nodes. An additional piece of tamper-proof hardware, Trusted Platform Module (TPM), is imposed into the sensor nodes. It secures the sensitive information (e.g., the session key) from attackers and monitors any platform environment changes with the Internal registers. With these features of TPM, the code Injection attack could be detected and removed when the contaminated nodes are challenged in our remote attestation protocol.  We implement the first two software-based protocols with Deluge as the reference network programming protocol in TinyOS, evaluate them with the extensive simulation using TOSSIM and validate the simulation results with experiments using Tmote. We implement the remote attestation protocol on Fleck, a sensor platform developed by CSIRO that Integrates an Atmel TPM chip.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Network Programming</field><field name="subject">Broadcast Authentication</field><field name="subject">Wireless Sensor Network</field><field name="subject">Code Dissemination</field><field name="subject">Trusted Platform Module</field><field name="subject">Sensor Worm Attack</field><field name="subject">Wormhole Attack</field><field name="subject">Remote Attestation</field><field name="subject">Secure Network Protocol</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I don???t mind being a diabetic but not every day!: learning to live with a chronic condition</field><field name="creator">Demirkol, Abdullah, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic conditions and their management have become a major global public health problem which poses a serious challenge for both health care systems and affected individuals. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition affecting almost 200 million people around the world, a number that is expected to double by 2020. As with most chronic conditions its management requires significant and permanent changes in people???s daily life practices as well as a strict medication regimen. Recent research demonstrates that it is possible to control the complications of diabetes, and even to prevent its development in predisposed individuals by following recommended treatments. Yet studies show that only 2% of people living with diabetes heed their treating team???s advice. This signals a serious discordance between scientifically generated information and its place in the daily lives of people living with diabetes. This study sought to discover how to change the factors that prevent people with type 2 diabetes from following their recommended treatments. Firstly a participant observation process in four diabetes education centres was used to define the characteristics of the context in which people with diabetes and their treating teams interacted. This was followed by a nine-month participatory action process in two of the four centres in which participants defined the problematic areas in the management of their diabetes and devised plans to tackle these problems. They then attempted to implement these plans while exploring how and why their plans did or did not work. The findings indicate that the decision to follow recommended treatments is far from being a matter of individual choice. Rather it is heavily influenced by a complex interaction of numerous factors that people with diabetes have limited power to change. This study reveals that the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes could be enhanced where operational and practical knowledge about the condition is provided to people living with the disorder by health care providers responsive to patients??? perspectives, and where patients, providers and policy-makers recognise that health is a resource constructed in the wider social context, whose every element needs to be harnessed in encouraging people to make healthier life decisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, construction and control of an industrial scale biped robot</field><field name="creator">Cronin, Joe, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A 500Kg, self-contained biped robot, named Roboshift, has been conceived and tested to investigate issues associated with the control of industrial scale biped robots. This project represents the first credible attempt to build a heavy weight autonomous biped robot. The recent expansion in humanoid robot development has highlighted advances made in anthropomorphic biped technology. Current research into speech recognition, vision systems, laser topography, artificial intelligence and electroactive polymers will ultimately achieve an Android capable of human like actions and thought processes. Justification for this most demanding and expensive research is based on philanthropic models that suggest these robots will attend to the bedridden, or replace humans in dangerous areas. However, the cost of a biped robot when compared to that of a wheeled or tracked vehicle restricts commercialisation for these applications. As well, the size and working capacity of current humanoid robots is not compatible with the heavy lifting requirements found in such environments. It is proposed that only biped robots of an industrial scale, possessing a capacity much greater than that of a human, will be of commercial value in the future. Typical applications may include the handling of materials in confined or uneven terrain, where a forklift or other commercially available materials handling equipment would be unsuitable. For example, field handling in military, mining or geological environments. Minimal research has been conducted into the realisation of such a device, which presents challenges in terms of the magnitude of dynamic forces produced and of the systems required to control the robot in real-time. Review of relevant literature reveals that little research has been completed in this field. Therefore, operational characteristics for an industrial scale biped robot are defined. The design then details the structure and integration of mechanical, hydraulic, and electrical systems. Roboshift is powered by an internal combustion engine and is the first biped robot with a capacity for extended operation. Modelling was conducted to determine joint trajectories, power requirements, hydraulic flow parameters and dynamic characteristics. The robot is controlled by a distributed, hierarchical system comprising sixteen microprocessors, a control computer acting as the midbrain and a communications computer acting as the central nervous system. Sensors measure attitude and heading (vestibular system) as well as ground reaction forces and joint angles (propreoception). The control strategy is based on feed forward trajectories generated by inverse kinematic analysis. Corrections to trajectories are made in real time by higher level routines running on the main control computer. Joint position is achieved by local feedback control. Software for the robot was written in the C language. Experimental results are presented detailing the performance of the robot in comparison to theoretical analysis. After construction and testing of actuators and sensors, calibration software was tested successfully. Once calibrated, the robot was lowered to the ground where the active balance software was able to control the robot in the frontal and sagittal planes. Frontal sway software was tested with mixed success as natural oscillation of the structure, which was not detectable by the control system, led to erroneous force data. Detailed dynamic modelling was then completed to determine the causes of oscillation in the robot. The modelling led to the formulation of a control strategy where non-collocated sensors are used to measure link strain as a feedback to a modified proportional controller. The project has demonstrated that an industrial scale biped incorporating an internal combustion engine and hydraulic power system is feasible.. Analysis presented proposes that as the height of a biped robot increases, the expected elastic deformation of the structure increases as the cube of the height, making control extremely challenging. A strategy for the control of heavy-weight robots is suggested It is also proposed that technology incorporated in current humanoid robots can not be scaled to control industrial bipeds.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">robots</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a model for patients??? acceptance of a home telecare management system</field><field name="creator">Rahimpour, Mohammadreza, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Successful implementation of any technology requires acceptance by the users. Numerous studies in the area of information technology acceptance, based on wellknown theories have been conducted to examine technology acceptance models and predict user adoption/acceptance behaviour. There are several studies dealing with patients??? acceptance of different telemedicine applications, but few about the patients??? acceptance of home telecare. Most existing studies are not based on a strong theoretical framework. In this study, based on an extensive literature review and preliminary qualitative data, a theoretical model of the effect of Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) characteristics and psychological variables associated with technophobia on patients??? acceptance of HTMS is proposed. The proposed model is an augmented Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1986), which is called Home Telecare Management System acceptance model (HTMS-AM), in which TAM has been augmented by two constructs: HTMS anxiety and HTMS self-efficacy. The model is proposed to improve our understanding regarding patients??? acceptance of HTMS, which may lead to successful design and implementation of home telecare systems. In addition, it can be used as a theoretical basis to evaluate new generations of HTMS in terms of users acceptance in the early stage of their design and development even prior to implementation. In order to test the reliability and validity of the measures, video demonstrations of a home telecare system and demonstration of a system prototype to potential users was employed. To propose the HTMS-AM the following five stages were taken: 1. General well-known theoretical models of human behaviour from psychology and technology acceptance models from information technology were reviewed to create a basic template for the proposed model. 2. A preliminary study (focus group interviews, Chapter 5) was conducted to assess patients??? perceptions of HTMS.  3. Based on an extensive literature review and findings from preliminary qualitative studies, HTMS acceptance model was proposed, to improve our understanding about factors, which may affect patients??? intention to use HTMS. Several adaptations were applied in the model to be applicable in the HTMS context, such as augmenting the model with HTMS self-efficacy and HTMS anxiety constructs. 4. To measure the different psychological variables in the proposed model, valid and reliable measures from previous studies were used. However the preliminary study was used to develop measures, which did not exist in the literature. 5. These measures were tested in the final study. The subjects were patients who had been affected with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and/or Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD). Given the chronic nature of these diseases, the necessity for extended monitoring and management and frequent admission to hospitals due to worsening health status, these patients were deemed the most appropriate candidates for the HTMS. Further studies with more cases need to be conducted to test the actual model in which the impact of HTMS characteristics, psychological and demographic factors associated with technophobia upon intention to use the HTMS and the correlation of these factors with each other in appropriate healthcare settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The practice of goodness</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Jennifer</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://epubs.scu.edu.au/theses/105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation and recombinant expression of antigens for the rapid diagnosis of West Nile virus infection</field><field name="creator">Jody Hobson-Peters</field><field name="description">West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen of global significance. It is active on several continents and is responsible for recent outbreaks of fever and fatal encephalitis in humans and horses. While highly virulent strains have been reported in Europe, North, Central and South America, only a benign subtype of WNV (Kunjin virus &#8211; KUNV) occurs in Australia. However, virulent, exotic WNV strains are seen as a significant threat to Australia due to the ease with which this virus can move between continents and the presence of suitable vectors and hosts already within Australia. KUNV and WNV subtypes are antigenically and genetically very closely related and cross-react in traditional serological tests. This cross-reactivity makes it very difficult to differentiate between KUNV and WNV infections using standard serological tests. The aim of this thesis was to identify immunogenic epitopes unique to KUNV or WNV and to use these epitopes in the development of a rapid assay that would enable the diagnosis of and surveillance for exotic virulent strains of WNV in Australia. The rapid diagnostic platform chosen was a red blood cell (RBC) agglutination assay that was originally patented and commercialised by AGEN Biomedical Ltd. The RBC agglutination assay reagent consists of the Fab region of a human erythrocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to the epitope of interest (in this instance, a WNV-specific peptide). This bi-functional reagent causes the agglutination of the patient&#8217;s erythrocytes in the presence of WNV-specific antibody in the patient&#8217;s serum. Traditionally, these RBC agglutination reagents have been produced by chemical conjugation. However, a potentially easier and cheaper method involves the linking of the gene encoding the erythrocyte-specific antibody to that encoding the epitope to create a recombinant version of the bi-functional agglutination reagent through expression using prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems. To identify potential differential epitopes, 18 mAbs to WNV (NY99 strain) prM and envelope (E) proteins were assessed. One mAb (17D7) differentially recognised WNV and KUNV in ELISA and maintained recognition of its corresponding epitope upon reduction and carboxymethylation of the viral antigen, suggesting a continuous (linear) epitope. Using synthetic peptides, the epitope was mapped to a 19 amino acid sequence (WN19: E147-165) encompassing the WNV NY99 E protein glycosylation site at position 154. An amino acid substitution at position E156 of many KUNV strains abolishes this glycosylation moiety. The inability of WNV-positive horse and mouse sera to bind the synthetic peptides indicated that glycosylation was required for recognition of peptide WN19 by WNV-specific antibodies in sera. N-linked glycosylation of WN19 was achieved through expression of the peptide as a C-terminal fusion protein in mammalian cells and specific reactivity of WNV-positive horse sera to the glycosylated WN19 fusion protein was shown by Western blot. Additional sera collected from horses that had been infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), which is similarly glycosylated at position E154 and exhibits high sequence identity to WNV NY99 in this region, also recognised the recombinant peptide. In contrast, no reactivity with the recombinant peptide was observed by sera from horses infected with the unglycosylated WNV subtype, KUNV. Failure of most WNV- and MVEV-positive horse sera to recognise the epitope as a deglycosylated fusion protein (75% and 100% respectively) confirmed that the N-linked glycan is important for antibody recognition of the peptide. Together, these results suggest that the induction of antibodies to the WN19 epitope during WNV infection of horses is generally associated with E protein glycosylation of the infecting viral strain. To assess the feasibility of using peptide WN19 in a rapid immunoassay, the peptide was recombinantly fused to a RBC (glycophorin)-specific single chain antibody (scFv) using previously published constructs which were developed for the bacterial expression of similar bi-functional reagents. To facilitate glycosylation of peptide WN19, the genes for the bi-functional agglutination reagents were subsequently cloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. An additional set of constructs were also produced in which the genes for the variable regions of the anti-RBC antibody were cloned into a vector for the secreted expression of an intact, humanised IgG1 molecule. Stable cell lines were produced for each of these constructs and secreted up to 700 ng/mL glycophorin-reactive antibody. The secreted recombinant protein could be harvested directly from the cell culture medium and used in RBC agglutination assays, where these bi-functional agglutination reagents could be cross-linked either with mAb 17D7 or by anti-peptide WN19 antibodies present in WNV-positive horse serum. The WNV NY99 prM protein was also identified as a useful marker of WNV-infection in horses, as well as a putative antigen to differentiate equine WNV NY99 and KUNV infections using Western blot. Two anti-WNV prM mAbs were also generated in this study and will be extremely valuable in future studies. Preliminary analysis of the prM epitope(s) bound by these mAbs and WNV-immune sera indicate that the binding site(s) is likely to be localised to pr and is conformational.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">06 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">West Nile virus</field><field name="subject">Kunjin Virus</field><field name="subject">Flavivirus</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal Antibody</field><field name="subject">single chain antibody</field><field name="subject">red blood cell agglutination</field><field name="subject">Recombinant Antibody</field><field name="subject">Epitope mapping</field><field name="subject">prM</field><field name="subject">Envelope Protein</field><field name="subject">Diagnostic Assay</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cost-effective Conservation Planning</field><field name="creator">Josie Carwardine</field><field name="description">Biodiversity is declining globally due to mounting anthropogenic threats. Actions to protect biodiversity against threats can be costly, involving land purchase, invasive species management, and inflicting opportunity costs of lost revenue and livelihoods in conservation areas. Governments and conservation organisations are under increasing pressure to deliver the greatest benefits from conservation funds, and to minimise conflicts between conservation and other human priorities. Most conservation planning approaches are limited in their ability to assist with cost-effective funding allocation decisions. First, approaches often lack quantifiable objectives and appropriate tools. Second, approaches rarely consider economic information, such as spatially explicit data on the costs of conservation actions. In this thesis I address these two limitations, which often co-occur, in spatial conservation planning. Problem definition includes specifying a quantifiable objective, a set of constraints and control variables, and knowledge of the system. A simple conservation objective is to protect target amounts of biodiversity features, such as 15% of the range of each species and vegetation type, over a minimal total reserve area. Here, targets are the constraints and the control variables are the decisions of whether or not to conserve each site. Target-based conservation planning is the dominant spatial prioritisation approach, but has been criticised for failing to protect untargeted portions of biodiversity and for employing targets too low to ensure species persistence. In Chapter 2, I review target-based systematic conservation planning, discovering that many perceived limitations can be overcome with current developments in research and software and better communication, whilst acknowledging the value of alternative approaches. Conservation planning objectives are becoming increasingly complex due to the need to conserve many kinds of features, such as species, habitat types, and ecosystem services. Measures of the spatial congruence between features is often used to determine if one feature is a good surrogate for representing another and whether multiple features can be easily captured in a single plan. In Chapter 3 I review the use of congruence metrics in conservation planning research, explaining the differences between the three most common metrics &#8211; spatial correlation, hotspot overlap, incidental representation &#8211; and demonstrating why high values in one metric can coincide with low values in another. Most importantly, I show that integrated systematic conservation planning, rather than congruence metrics, is the only way to determine how efficient it will be to protect multiple features in a reserve system. While conservation planning has an implicit goal of cost-efficiency, spatially explicit data on the costs of conservation action are rarely considered. Prioritisation analyses that do not consider conservation costs can lead to the misallocation of funds and high opportunity costs. In Chapter 4 I carry out a global analysis at 1&#186; resolution to identify areas that could protect targets of 10% of every mammal species&#8217; range whilst minimising the opportunity costs of forgone agricultural production. The a priori inclusion of opportunity costs reduced the cost of meeting conservation targets by at least 30%. I then compare cost-effective allocation of funds to actual funding allocation by international conservation agencies in 2006, highlighting globally important, threatened and under-funded regions. While estimates of conservation opportunity costs can increase conservation planning efficiency, there are often various actions under consideration, each with different associated costs. The definition of specific actions, and their respective costs, is rarely considered in conservation planning. In Chapter 5 I develop cost surfaces for two conservation actions in Australia (i) land purchase for reservation estimated by unimproved land values and (ii) stewardship payments to private landholders to conserve biodiversity estimated by forgone agricultural production. I then identify priority areas at a 10 km2 resolution for conserving 15% of the pre-clearing extent of a range of biodiversity features by these actions. I demonstrate that using cost data to reflect specific conservation actions minimises improves financial efficiency by up to two-fold. Cost-effective conservation planning is also hindered by uncertainties in estimates of conservation costs. In Chapter 6 I carry out the first comprehensive sensitivity analysis of conservation priorities to cost value, using the same goal as in Chapter 5, but restricting planning to reservation in Queensland, which is the Australian state with the best quality unimproved land value data. First, I show that sites which are essential or unhelpful for meeting conservation targets maintain a high and low priority status respectively, over a large range of cost data (1-400% of their estimated cost). Medium priority sites are sensitive to estimates of cost, and represent the greatest opportunities to make cost-effective decisions. Next I develop a simple approach for planning with uncertain cost data, where priorities can be updated as real information on the cost of a parcel of land becomes available. This chapter shows that uncertain cost data is useful for conservation planning. Potentially cost-effective areas for conservation actions in Australia are identified in Chapters 5 and 6. My final chapter serves to synthesise and interpret this research. Through comprehensive analyses, I have shown that cost-effective conservation planning requires the definition of appropriate objectives and tools, and the integration of conservation costs. Further, I have demonstrated accessible approaches that integrate these crucial factors, showing at least a doubling of efficiency in conservation investments. There are cost-effective opportunities for conservation actions in Australia and around the world: this research will assist Governments, Non-Government Organisations, and other conservation-minded people in finding them. Further investment is required in obtaining and wisely applying socio-economic data for conservation planning and in evaluating conservation projects to improve our knowledge base.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systematic conservation planning</field><field name="subject">priority setting</field><field name="subject">Decision Theory</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermodynamic Models for the Analysis of Quantitative Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="creator">Denis Bauer</field><field name="description">Understanding transcriptional regulation quantitatively is a crucial step towards uncovering and ultimately utilizing the regulatory semantics encoded in the genome. Transcription of a gene is induced by the binding of site-specific transcription factors (TFs) to so-called cis-regulatory-modules (CRMs). The frequency and duration of the binding events are influenced by the concentrations of the TFs, the binding affinities and location of the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the CRM as well as the properties of the TFs themselves (e.g. effectiveness, competitive interaction with other TFs). Modeling these interactions using a mathematical approach, based on sound biochemical and thermodynamic foundations, enables the understanding and quantitative prediction of transcriptional output of a target gene. In the thesis I introduce the developed framework for modeling, visualizing, and predicting the regulation of the transcription rate of a target gene. Given the concentrations of a set of TFs, the TFBSs in a regulatory DNA region, and the transcription rate of the target gene, the method will optimize its parameters to generate a predictive model that incorporates the regulatory mechanism of the observed gene. I demonstrate the generalization ability of the model by subjecting it to standard machine learning and hypothesis testing procedures. Furthermore, I demonstrate the potential of the approach by training the method on a gene in D. melanogaster and predicting the output of the homologous genes in 12 other Drosophila species where the regulatory sequence has evolved substantially but the regulatory mechanism was conserved. Finally, I investigate the proposed role-switching behaviour of TFs regulating the development of D. melanogaster, which suggests that SUMOylation is the biological mechanism facilitating the switch.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Transcriptional Regulation</field><field name="subject">Gene Regulation</field><field name="subject">Transcription Factor</field><field name="subject">Thermodynamic modeling</field><field name="subject">Optimization Problems</field><field name="subject">Comparative Genomics</field><field name="subject">Evolution and phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">SUMOylation</field><field name="subject">D. melanogaster</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:203909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of fish larvae in pumicestone passage an estuarine system in southeast Queensland Australia</field><field name="creator">Pham, C.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">630302 Fisheries-recreational</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Links between mangroves and fisheries in Moreton Bay and in Northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Manson, F.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hiding in a hollow tree</field><field name="creator">Kenobi, Ben Tuhoe</field><field name="description">Starting with a broad analysis of game story-telling methods, this project seeks to interrogate a player&#8217;s occupation and navigation of the possibility space of a game&#8217;s meta-narrative and isolate &#8216;story-telling&#8217; techniques specific and inherent to the computer-game medium.

Research into how the eye automatically changes its accommodation, demands an instrument capable of tracking the accommodation with fine resolution and adequate corner frequency. An instrument capable of tracking the ocular accommodation is called an optometer. Reports of earlier optometers show that optometers using the older Scheiner principlecan have the required precision and dynamics required to track the micro fluctuations accommodation. However optometers using the Scheiner principle require precise alignment to the patient&#8217;s pupil to be maintained throughout the measurement time. Previous optometers have used the radiation reflected from the patient&#8217;s cornea (calledthe corneal reflection) to initially align the optical axis of the optometer to the centre of the patient&#8217;s pupil. Since the Scheiner principle optometer uses radiant energy reflected from the patient&#8217;s retina to make a refractive measurement, the idea of using this same radiant energy for patient alignment is investigated. Earlier optometers have blocked the corneal reflection from reaching the photodetectors for the retinal reflection using a small fixed light stop. Since it is not possible to use a fixed light stop if the retinal reflection is used for alignment, the feasibility of using crossed linear polarizers is experimentally evaluated. The results showed that about78% of the radiant energy reflected from the front lens of an artificial eye could be eliminated using crossed linear polarizers. Whether the Scheiner principle measurement of refraction of an artificial eye could be done with 78% of the front lens (corneal) reflection removed was investigated. The results were not conclusive. There was not a measureable indication of when the refraction of the experimental optometer matched that of the artificial eye. The experimental optometer system attempts to use a servo controlled mirror system to move the optical axis of the optometer so that it coincides with the optical axis of an artificial eye. The design, development and testing of the mirror system is described. The mirror system enables the optometer to perform a two dimensional scan over the pupil plane of the patient&#8217;s eye or an artificial eye. During the scanning, the total radiant power reflected can be measured. For the optometer to be aligned using radiation reflected from the retina, a scan of the pupil plane of should reveal the pupil boundaries. This was experimentally demonstrated to work. Unfortunately time limitations did not permit further development of an automatic eye alignment and tracking system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optometer</field><field name="subject">Infrared</field><field name="subject">Alignment</field><field name="subject">Eye tracking</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expressibility of higher-order logics on relational databases : proper hierarchies : a dissertation presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Systems at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ferrarotti, Flavio Antonio</field><field name="description">We investigate the expressive power of different fragments of higher-order logics over finite relational structures (or equivalently, relational databases) with special emphasis in higher-order logics of order greater than or equal three. Our main results concern the study of the effect on the expressive power of higher-order logics, of simultaneously bounding the arity of the higher-order variables and the alternation of quantifiers. Let AAi(r,m) be the class of (i + 1)-th order logic formulae where all quantifiers are grouped together at the beginning of the formulae, forming m alternating blocks of consecutive existential and universal quantifiers, and such that the maximal-arity (a generalization of the concept of arity, not just the maximal of the arities of the quantified variables) of the higher-order variables is bounded by r. Note that, the order of the quantifiers in the prefix may be mixed. We show that, for every i [greater than or equal to] 1, the resulting AAi hierarchy of formulae of (i + 1)-th order logic is proper. This extends a result by Makowsky and Pnueli who proved that the same hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. In both cases the strategy used to prove the results consists in considering the set AUTOSAT(F) of formulae in a given logic F which, represented as finite structures, satisfy themselves. We then use a similar strategy to prove that the classes of [Sigma superscript i subscript m union Pi superscript i subscript m] formulae in which the higher-order variables of all orders up to i+1 have maximal-arity at most r, also induce a proper hierarchy in each higher-order logic of order i [greater than or equal to] 3. It is not known whether the correspondent hierarchy in second-order logic is proper. Using the concept of finite model truth definitions introduced by M. Mostowski, we give a sufficient condition for that to be the case. We also study the complexity of the set AUTOSAT(F) and show that when F is one of the prenex fragments [Sigma superscript 1 subscript m] of second-order logic, it follows that AUTOSAT(F) becomes a complete problem for the corresponding prenex fragment [Sigma superscript 2 subscript m] of third-order logic. Finally, aiming to provide the background for a future line of research in higher-order logics, we take a closer look to the restricted second-order logic SO[superscript w] introduced by Dawar. We further investigate its connection with the concept of relational complexity studied by Abiteboul, Vardi and Vianu. Dawar showed that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] is equivalent to the nondeterministic inflationary fixed-point logic NFP. Since NFP captures relational NP, it follows that the existential fragment of SO[superscript w] captures relational NP. We give a direct proof, in the style of the proof of Fagin&#8217;s theorem, of this fact. We then define formally the concept of relational machine with relational oracle and prove the exact correspondence between the prenex fragments of SO[superscript w] and the levels of the relational polynomial-time hierarchy. This allows us to stablish a direct connection between the relational polynomial hierarchy and SO without using the Abiteboul and Vianu normal form for relational machines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">relational databases</field><field name="subject">computer logic</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280100 Information Systems::280108 Database management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. EMBARGOED till 25 October 2010</field><field name="creator">Cox, Simon</field><field name="description">Ethnic status is one of the most protected demographic groups in terms of test bias and discrimination in personnel selection, as such bias breaches many laws, morals, and ethical procedures. To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial ecology, habitat use, and the impacts of rats on chevron skinks (Oligosoma homalonotum) on Great Barrier Island : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Barr, Benjamin Philip</field><field name="description">The chevron skink (Oligosoma homalonotum) is one of the largest, yet least observed skink species in New Zealand. The species was thought to have once been widespread in Northern New Zealand, however currently it is only found on Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands. Great Barrier Island is the apparent stronghold for the species although it appears to be in decline there, despite a net increase in habitat. Recent studies have increased the understanding of the general ecology of the species, however little is known about the threats to the survival of this species. This study had two main objectives; the first was to establish if rats are a threat to chevron skinks, and the second was to increase current knowledge of the species ecology. The research was undertaken in an area of extensive rodent control (Glenfern Sanctuary) and an adjacent unmanaged reserve in Port Fitzroy, on Great Barrier Island in 2008. The first objective of this study involved confirming that rat densities in the treatment (Glenfern Sanctuary) were sufficiently different to allow meaningful comparisons of chevron skink population characteristics between sites. This was achieved by determining absolute rat densities using Zippin&#8217;s removal method at four sites, and correlating these with a relative abundance measure (tracking rates) to give confidence in the observed trends. Rat densities were high (1.94 - 3.00 rats ha-1) in the control, and low (0.00 and 0.06 rats ha-1) in the treatment sites, and these correlated well with tracking rates. In light of these clear differences between the treatment and control, the population structure and condition of chevron skinks were compared between sites. The population structure showed erosion of juvenile and sub-adult size categories, which indicated differences in vulnerabilities between size categories. Physical evidence of failed rat predation was also observed in adult skinks in the unmanaged control, which confirmed that rats were interacting with chevron skinks. Although the adults survived the attacks they suffered injuries including eye damage, punctures, cuts and tail loss. Smaller skinks would be unlikely to survive such attacks due to the severity and scale of the injuries, supporting the assertions of the population structure that smaller skinks may be more vulnerable than adults. The extent of tail loss was converted to a condition index to determine if failed rat predation was more widespread in the population, than was observed by conspicuous injuries. This condition index (body-tail condition index) was stable through all size categories in the treatment, but significantly reduced in adults in the unmanaged sites. That there was no reduction in the condition of smaller skinks in the unmanaged control sites despite high rat densities suggests that interactions between rats and smaller skinks are fatal, and thus not represented in the data. Nine chevron skinks were radio-tracked to determine habitat use, home range and ranging behaviour. Habitat use of chevron skinks was similar to a previous study and demonstrated that trees, crevices and logs were important refuge sites. Chevron skinks were more likely to be found at sites with trees, crevices and debris dams. Chevron skink home ranges indicated that adults moved further away from streams than previously anticipated at this time of year, and skinks demonstrated site fidelity. There was also overlap in home ranges between individuals, and skinks with overlapping home ranges shared common refuges. During flooding events, chevron skinks exhibited an arboreal response that appears to be a behaviour specific to stream associated animals, which allows them to avoid being taken by floodwaters.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Oligosoma homalonotum</field><field name="subject">chevron skink</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">rat predation</field><field name="subject">conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of custom to contemporary Maori resource development : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Maori Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cragg, Melissa</field><field name="description">Maori have always sought to carefully manage the natural environment &#8211; to ensure the sustainability of resources and the well-being of future generations. The dynamic nature of any culture provides flexibility for growth and development, so that new challenges can be faced with assurance and that dynamic and meaningful solutions can be found. This concept of flexibility and willingness to embrace change has been a feature of Maori culture and is documented throughout Maori history and within korero purakau. Therefore the requirement to embrace contemporary approaches to resource management has not been resisted. However, the desire to align traditional concepts with contemporary resource management conventions has at times been met with opposition and disapproval. This, despite the fact that the two world views have much in common and are not necessarily inconsistent with each other. &#8216;The Application of Custom to Contemporary Maori Resource Development&#8217; is both the title of the thesis and the name given to the framework which it describes. The framework is a tool for future resource management that provides three levels of information. First, it identifies the resources where customary and contemporary methodology is currently being utilised. Second, it outlines the alignment and synergies that exist, and finally, it identifies barriers to the amalgamation and integration of both approaches. The framework by itself will not address all the complex issues associated with Maori resource management; there are many other considerations that are beyond the scope of this thesis that would need to be dealt with in order to achieve that outcome. However, the framework does provide a mechanism through which Maori values and practices can be considered alongside Western views and perspectives. The Framework will contribute to the development of more effective strategies, policies and planning. Thus, &#8216;The Application of Custom to Contemporary Maori Resource Development&#8217; will contribute to improving the sustainable utilisation of natural resources.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maori values</field><field name="subject">Resource management</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Causes of corruption : an empirical investigation in a cross-country framework : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosphy in Economics, Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Saha, Shrabani</field><field name="description">In recent years corruption has come to be considered as a pervasive phenomenon, and a major obstacle in the process of economic development. However, there exist few studies that discuss the factors that cause corruption and why some countries are more corrupt than others. This research contributes to that rather scanty literature and focuses on the causes of corruption. More importantly, the study empirically investigates various causes of corruption, in particular the role of economic development, democracy and economic freedom in explaining the observed variations in corruption across countries, and the nexus between democracy and economic freedom in combating corruption. The study first tests the reliability of the recent quantitative innovations in the study of corruption in terms of the Corruption Perception Index, constructed by Transparency International. Using theoretical and empirical analysis, various hypotheses regarding corruption and its determinants are examined using panel data for 100 countries during the period 1995 to 2004. The empirical findings show that the subjective indexing process of corruption perception eventually converges to a common consensus. In evaluating the relationship between economic development and corruption, the results suggest that income per capita, education, unemployment, income inequality, economic freedom and democracy are among the factors which determine and help explain the cross-country differences in corruption. Furthermore, the assessment of the relationship between democracy and corruption shows that an &#8216;electoral democracy&#8217;, represented by &#8216;political rights&#8217;, is not in itself sufficient to reduce corruption. Instead, for low levels of corruption to exist, the presence of an advanced fully-formed mature democracy is required. A characteristic of a mature democracy is the existence of an environment where the probability of being caught, if acting corruptly, is very high. In addition, the examination of the interaction between economic freedom and democracy suggests that economic freedom reduces corruption in any political environment, and the effect is substantially larger with a high level of democracy. The interesting and important findings of the analysis indicate that there exists a non-linear relationship between corruption and the level of income as well as democracy. The findings suggest that developed countries have succeeded in controlling corruption through higher levels of economic development along with the economic and political freedoms that their peoples enjoy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Political corruption</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Economic freedom</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Desirable impact : an exploration of how design for desirability can enhance a forecast snowboarding safety product</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Lans</field><field name="description">With origins in skateboard and surfing culture, snowboarding has grown to become a mainstream recreational and professional sport, officially recognized in the Olympic Games. This popularity can be attributed to several factors, including the sub-culture of rebellion and self-expression it embodies and the daring, dynamic aerial maneuvers and stunts often portrayed in the media. However, the sport also exposes participants to a well-documented injury pattern, with injuries rates typically twice as frequent as those seen in skiing. While a number of studies have shown existing snowboarding safety products reduce the risk of injury, these readily available products are not widely used among participants who view them as &#8220;uncool&#8221; and &#8220;unnecessary&#8221;. Exploring how affective features and attributes can improve the desirability of a forecast snowboarding personal protective equipment (PPE) product, this thesis proposes that a primary requirement for these products must be desirability - to make attractive, to create a positive impression, to strengthen ones identity and engender appreciation. Responding to these emotional needs, this thesis presents a proposal for a product designed to enhance user-experience, challenging the current philosophy of safety products and their &#8216;uncool&#8217; perceptions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snowboarding</field><field name="subject">Personal protective equipment</field><field name="subject">Industrial design</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410299 Visual arts and crafts studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birds in a tree : a journey through avian phylogeny, with particular emphasis on the birds of New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Genetics</field><field name="creator">Gibb, Gillian Claire</field><field name="description">Two main themes to the avian research presented in this thesis are, 1. Deep resolution of birds generally, and 2. Investigation of specific aspects of the New Zealand avifauna. More specifically, this thesis covers phylogeny, and predictions about palaeognaths, pigeons, pelecaniforms and passerines. Significant progress is made in resolving the basal branches of Neoaves. This thesis examines whether the six-way basal Neoavian split of Cracraft (2001) is, in principle, resolvable. New mitochondrial genomes are added to improve taxon sampling, break up long branches, and allow testing of the prior assumptions of six Neoavian groups. This research shows the six-way split is resolvable, although more work is required for specific details. From a life-history perspective, it is interesting that the two bird-of-prey groups (falcons and buzzards) are very divergent, and may not be sister groups. Molecular dating supports major diversification of at least 12 Neoavian lineages in the Late Cretaceous. Additionally, novel avian mitochondrial gene orders are investigated and a hypothesis put forward suggesting gene conversion and stable intermediate forms allows an apparently rare event (gene rearrangement) to occur multiple times within Neoaves. One of Cracraft&#8217;s six groups, informally called the &#8216;Conglomerati&#8217;, is particularly difficult to resolve. The pigeons (Columbiformes) lie within the &#8216;Conglomerati&#8217;, and this chapter examines two aspects along the continuum of pigeon evolution. Firstly the large South Pacific fruit pigeon radiation is examined with mid-length mitochondrial sequences. This clade contains a third of all pigeon species, and has been very successful in island colonisation throughout South East Asia and the Pacific. Secondly, candidates for the closest relative of pigeons are tested using analysis of whole mitochondrial genomes. Highest support was found for the grouping of sandgrouse and pigeon, although they are clearly very divergent. Also within the &#8216;Conglomerati&#8217; is the traditional order Pelecaniformes, and their close allies the Ciconiiformes. These orders (the P&amp;C) are part of an adaptive radiation of seabird water-carnivores, including loons, penguins, petrels and albatrosses. This group is separate from the large shorebird water-carnivore group; although both appear to have begun radiating abut 70 million years ago. The tropicbird represents a separate, convergent life history and is not part of the Pelecaniformes, nor within the larger seabird water-carnivore group. Resolution of the basal phylogeny of oscine passerines is important for interpreting the radiation of this group out of the Australasian region. Many endemic New Zealand oscine passerines belong to &#8216;basal corvid&#8217; lineages, but have not previously been investigated with mitochondrial DNA. This chapter shows that many &#8216;basal corvid&#8217; lineages are actually &#8216;basal passerine&#8217; lineages, and there is a discrepancy between nuclear Rag-1 phylogenies (the most commonly used gene in passerine phylogenetics) and other phylogenies, including mitochondrial, that requires further investigation. Taken as a whole, this thesis adds significantly to our understanding of the evolution of birds, and provides a foundation for future research, not only of phylogenetic relationships, but also of avian life history, long-term niche stability and macroevolution.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neoavian genetics</field><field name="subject">Evolution of birds</field><field name="subject">Phylogenetic relationships</field><field name="subject">Mitochondrial DNA</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270208 Molecular evolution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurological development and the potential for conscious perception after birth : comparison between species and implications for animal welfare : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physiology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Diesch, Tamara Johanna</field><field name="description">In order for animals to experience pain and to suffer from it, they have to be capable of conscious perception. Recent evidence suggests that the fetus is maintained in a sleeplike unconscious state and that conscious perception therefore only occurs after birth. The timing of the onset of conscious perception depends on the maturation of underlying neurological processes and is anticipated to be species dependent. Painspecific electroencephalographic (EEG) responses of lightly anaesthetised young of three species born at different levels of neurological development were investigated. The results of the present thesis are in agreement with published data on general neurological, EEG and behavioural development. This information, in addition to the present results, has been used to estimate the approximate time of the onset of conscious perception in tammar wallaby joeys, rat pups and newborn lambs. In wallaby joeys (extremely immature at birth), the EEG remained isoelectric until about 100-120 days of in-pouch age and became continuous by about 150-160 days, with electroencephalographic and behavioural signs of conscious perception apparent by about 160-180 days. In rat pups (immature at birth), the absence of a differentiated EEG suggests that the ability for conscious perception in pups younger than 10-12 days is doubtful. The marginal EEG responses to noxious stimulation in 12-14 day-old pups and the pronounced EEG responses in pups 18-20 days suggest that rats may be capable of conscious perception from 12-14 days onwards. In lambs (mature at birth), full conscious perception is probably not apparent before 5 minutes after birth and may take up to several hours or days to become fully established. Its modulation by the residual neuroinhibitor allopregnanolone, if that occurs, would be highest over the first 12 hours after birth. Overall, the onset of conscious perception does not seem to follow an &#8220;on-off phenomenon&#8221;, but seems to develop gradually, even in species born neurologically mature. Although conscious perception, and hence pain experience, may be qualitatively different in younger animals, on the basis of the precautionary principle, when significantly invasive procedures are planned, pain relief should be provided from those postnatal ages when pain may first be perceived &#8211; i.e. from about 120 days in the tammar wallaby joey, about 10 days in the rat pup and from soon after birth in the lamb.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pain experience</field><field name="subject">Neurological processes</field><field name="subject">Newborn animals</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270600 Physiology::270604 Comparative physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taupaenui : Maori positive ageing : a thesis presented in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Public Health at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edwards, William John Werahiko</field><field name="description">The global phenomenon of population ageing has major ramifications for societies and governments around the world. In New Zealand, efforts to address the impacts of population ageing have centred on the Government&#8217;s Positive Ageing Strategy. This is a thesis about positive ageing as viewed through Maori eyes. It has been informed by the memories and aspirations of older Maori who have lived through challenging times but have emerged with qualities that enable them to enjoy older age and to contribute to their own whanau, Te Ao Maori (the Maori world) and Te Ao Whanui (wider society). The thesis is philosophically located at the interface between Western science and matauranga Maori, an Indigenous inquiry paradigm. It is argued that Western science and matauranga Maori are relevant to research in the contemporary context, and reflect the realities of older Maori who live in both Te Ao Maori and Te Ao Whanui. The study used research techniques that draw on Western science (literature review), matauranga Maori (review of 42 Maori proverbs) and both inquiry paradigms simultaneously (qualitative study with 20 older Maori people). The research found that Maori positive ageing can be characterised by a two dimensional concept that incorporates a process dimension and an outcome dimension. The process dimension is consistent with a lifecourse perspective and therefore recognises that ageing is a life-long process where circumstances encountered during life may impact cumulatively and manifest in old age. The outcome dimension can be described in terms of complementary &#8216;universal&#8217; and Maori specific outcome domains. The universal outcome domains are encapsulated in the New Zealand Positive Ageing Strategy and more recently are expressed in the Positive Ageing Indicators 2007 Report. The Maori-specific outcome domains identified in this Study are: kaitiakitanga &#8211; stewardship; whanaungatanga &#8211; connectedness; taketuku &#8211; transmission; takoha &#8211; contribution; takatu &#8211; adaptability; and, tino rangatiratanga &#8211; selfdetermination.

One of the most important developments in the area of planned change has been on how to work with large systems so as to initiate and sustain change over time. It was from such contexts that the matrix concept emerged. During the 1950s the term matrix emerged in the United States aerospace industry and, as it has developed through the years, the term has come to be accepted in both business and academic circles. In the 1960s the matrix was sought as a fundamental alternative for dealing with unique management problems of coordination, communication and control (Davis and Lawrence, 1977). In the 1970s and 1980s interest in matrix organizational structures peaked. Since that time, research and literature on the matrix has diminished; contrarily, organizations continue to adopt the matrix as a viable alternative to deal with their increasingly complex business environment. In the recent past, some of the companies that applied a complex global matrix structure have included Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), Zurich (1991); Brown &amp; Root (BR), UK (1999); Hatch (1999) &#8211; Formerly BHPE and Kaiser mergers; IMC (1999); Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), (1999); and Sinclair Knight and Merz (SKM), (2002). These companies have used matrix structures to achieve worldwide economies of scale, combined with local flexibility and responsiveness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure, with a focus that includes identifying: i. The key factors behind the strategic decision to change the corporate organization in international companies to a matrix structure. ii. The weaknesses and strengths of these matrix structures for subsequent organizational performance. iii. The effects of transition to matrix structure on organizational performance. iv. The factors used to maintain a power balance between divisions. v. A model that seeks to diminish or reduce matrix structure weaknesses to increase organizational effectiveness. The research was conducted in the form of a questionnaire survey and semistructured interviews. To illustrate the implementation of the matrix structure that occurred in a real world environment, SKM has been researched as an intensive case study. Preface As a professional engineer I have had opportunities to be involved with major projects in various international organizations. I have also had opportunities to observe organizations and to analyse their operations by exploring existing procedures and manuals. It was noticeable that the overall success of the projects relied very much on organizational decision making. This observation led my paradigm shift from projects to organizational studies and to the idea of conducting research that aims to investigate the weaknesses and strengths of matrix structures for organizational performance. Introduction Thesis structure This thesis presents a detailed account of the research activities undertaken by Nursen Saracoglu and the outcomes of that research. The purpose of this research is to investigate the validity of political theories of organizations in major international companies that have implemented matrix structure. Data has been collected using a combination of methods, including questionnaires, semistructured interviews, and direct examination of library catalogues and databases. The structure of this thesis is designed as follows: Chapter 1 introduces, and describes the background to the research project. The theories that provide a background to the various factors involved in organizations choosing to change to matrix structures, and the resulting positive and negative effects on the organization, are presented in this chapter. Chapters 2 reviews and analyses the literature review that has been conducted to focus, especially, on how changes to the structure and design of power in matrix organizations can have important implications and consequences. The literature review looks in detail at different organizational theories, particularly theories on power within organizations, which have a bearing on the effect of a matrix structure on an organization. Each theory is critiqued in terms of its relevance to matrix structure analysis. Strategic Contingencies Theory (SCT) and Resource Dependency Theory (RDT) best explain the effect of different levels of power inside a matrix structure. Chapter 3 details the research design and methodology. This chapter describes the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative and qualitative approaches and presents the rationale of selecting research methodology. The participating organization, SKM, is described in terms of its history and its matrix structure is outlined. Chapter 4 illustrates the results of research that defines potential areas of concern associated with matrix structures. The discussion mainly centres on the methods used to analyse the data and then focuses on the different dependent and independent variables derived from the data that are used in the analysis for correlation purposes. The aim of this chapter is to explain the various statistics used to analyse the data and to list the variables that came up as a result of answers to questionnaire. These variables are then analysed against each other in order to develop a sense of the effectiveness of the matrix structure in SKM. In Chapter 5 the qualitative data was examined using the responses obtained from interviews with the top managers of SKM. This chapter aims to identify the themes that have emerged from these interview responses and present them in order of most to least common within each area of research, illustrated with comments from some of the respondents. Chapter 6 discusses the survey and interview results in order to exploit quantitative findings to identify patterning in qualitative data. In parallel with SCT and RDT, the relationship between power and performance in matrix organizations is presented. The new concepts that emerged based on the research findings are introduced and discussed according to the relevance to the research objectives. Chapter 7 This chapter concludes the research and presents research limitations, boundaries, the contribution to the body of knowledge and a summary of future research opportunities. The case studies give a sense of how various elements of Matrix structure that outlined in this research were actually applied by other particular organizations are exhibited in Appendix A.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational behaviour.</field><field name="subject">Organizational change.</field><field name="subject">Matrix organization.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Opening the black box of guideline implementation : primary health care nurses use of a guideline for cardiovascular risk.</field><field name="creator">McKillop, Ann Margaret</field><field name="description">The implementation of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in primary health care can substantially improve health promotion, early disease detection and the reduction of the burden of chronic disease. However, the implementation of evidence into clinical practice is a highly complex endeavour that has been said to occur in a 'black box&#8216;, defying easily reached explanations of how it happens in practice. The aim of this study is to explore the 'black box&#8216; of guideline implementation associated with primary health care nurses&#8216; use of a guideline that targets high health need populations in a region of New Zealand. The potential for improvement of cardiovascular health overall and the reduction of the marked disparities between M&#228;ori (indigenous people of New Zealand) and non-M&#228;ori drives the imperative to enact the recommendations of the Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. Primary health care nurses are well positioned at the frontline of healthcare to implement the guideline and an investigation of the realities of their practice as they do so will help to illuminate the contents of this particular 'black box&#8216;. The aim is achieved in two components by: 1. Exploring the complexities of primary health care nurses&#8216; use of the New Zealand Assessment and Management of Cardiovascular Risk guideline. 2. Employing the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework to identify the enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in the primary health care setting. Method Both components of this study involve qualitative methods. The first component involves qualitative description utilising focus groups and interviews to explore the perceptions and experiences of a range of primary health care professionals involved in implementing the AMCVR guideline and thematic analysis of data. The second component utilises template analysis of the data, based on the Promoting Action of Research Implementation in Health Services (PARiHS) framework. There are three elements of the PARiHS framework: Evidence, Context and Facilitation. This second component of the study is a systematic analysis of the enablers and barriers encountered by nurses as they implement the AMCVR guideline. Results The first component of the study generated four themes, which together have provided a rich portrait of the realities for nurses as they implemented the guideline. The four themes are self-managing client, everyday nursing practice, developing new relationships in the health team, and impact on health care delivery. The template analysis revealed that there were several enablers and barriers to guideline implementation in relation to Evidence and Context and that Facilitation was not occurring in a planned way. Conclusion Successful guideline implementation demands multidisciplinary, transformational practice development to create an effective workplace culture. Practice development is a powerful approach well suited to supporting primary health care nurses to maximise their practice-based knowledge and skills, and for them to contribute to the development of systems that will meet the information and communication requirements of successful guideline implementation. The imperative to improve cardiovascular health overall and specifically to address M&#228;ori health inequity mandates sustained effort and mobilisation of resources to ensure successful implementation of the AMCVR guideline.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative description.</field><field name="subject">Clinical practice guidelines.</field><field name="subject">Primary health care.</field><field name="subject">Implementation of evidence.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The water-energy nexus : a comprehensive analysis in the context of New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Debborah</field><field name="description">Water and electricity are fundamentally linked. Policy reforms in both industries, however, do not appear to acknowledge the links nor consider their wider implications. This is clearly unhelpful, particularly as policy makers attempt to develop effective responses to water and energy issues, underpinned by prevailing drought conditions and impending climate change. Against this backdrop, this research has comprehensively analysed the links between water and electricity &#8211; termed water-energy nexus &#8211; in the context of New South Wales. For this purpose, this research has developed an integrated methodological framework. The philosophical guidance for the development of this framework is provided by Integral Theory, and its analytical foundations rest on a suite of research methods including historical analysis, inputoutput analysis, analysis of price elasticities, and long-term scenario analysis. This research suggests that the historical and inextricable links between water and electricity, in the absence of integrated policies, has given rise to water-energy trade-offs. In the electricity industry, water-intensive coal-fired power stations that dominate base-load capacity in the National Electricity Market has resulted in intra- and inter-jurisdictional water sharing tradeoffs. Intermediate and peak demand technologies, suchas gas-fired, cogeneration and renewables, however, would significantly reduce the industry&#8217;s water consumption and carbon emissions. Drought and climate change adaptation responses in the water industry are likely to further increase electricity demand andpotentially contribute to climate change, due to policies that encourage investment in energy-intensive technologies, such as desalination, advanced wastewater treatment and rainwater tanks. Increasing electricity costs due to water shortages and the introduction of emissions trading will futher increase water and electricity prices for end users. Demand management strategies in both industries will assist in curbing price increases, however, their effectiveness is lessened by investment in water- and energy-intensive technologies in both industries. The analysis also demonstrates that strategies to reduce water and electricity consumption of &#8216;other&#8217; production sectors in New South Wales is overwhelmingly dependent on how deeply a particular sector is embedded in the economy, in terms of its contribution to economic output, income generation and employment growth. Regulation, demand management programs, and water pricing policies, for example, that reduce the water and energy intensity of agriculture and key manufacturing sectors are likely to benefit the wider economy and the Environment. The future implications of the water-energy nexus are examined through long-term scenario analysis for New South Wales for 2031. The analysis demonstrates how policy decisions shape the domain for making philosophical choices by society - in terms of the balance between relying on alternative technologies and market arrangements, with differing implications for water and electricity use, and for instigating behavioural change. Based on these findings, this research puts forward a range of recommendations, essentially arguing for reorienting existing institutional arrangements, government measures and industry activities in a way that would encourage integration between the water and energy policies. Although the context of this research is New South Wales, the findings are equally relevant for other Australian states, which share the same national water and energy policy frameworks. Further, the concepts and frameworks developed in this research are also of value to other countries and regions that are faced with the task of designing appropriate policy responses to redress their water and energy challenges.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power consumption.</field><field name="subject">Water-energy nexus.</field><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Water consumption.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond words: newly-arrived children's perceptions of music learning and music making</field><field name="creator">Howell, Gillian</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the way refugee and immigrant children, newly-arrived in Australia, perceive and describe music learning and music making.

In order to assess the potential of such beam-oriented technologies, direct representation of the dispersion of multipath fading channel in angular and temporal domains is required. This representation can only be achieved with the use of spatial channel models. This thesis thus focuses on the issue of spatial channel modeling for cellular systems and on its use in the characteri- zation of multipath fading channels. The results of this thesis are presented mainly in five parts: a) modeling of scattering mechanisms, b) derivation of the closed-form expressions for the spatio-temporal characteristics, c) generalization of the quantitative measure of angular spread, d) investigation of the effect of mobile motion on the spatio-temporal characteris- tics, and e) characterization of fast fading channel and its use in the signature sequence adaptation for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system. The thesis begins with an overview of the fundamentals of spatial channel modeling with regards to the specifics of cellular environments. Previous modeling approaches are dis- cussed intensively and a generalized spatial channel model, the 'Eccentro-Scattering Model' is proposed. Using this model, closed-form mathematical expressions for the distributions of angle and time of multipath arrival are derived. These theoretical results for the picocell, microcell and macrocell environments, when compared with previous models and available measurements, are found to be realistic and generic. In macrocell environment, the model incorporates the effect of distant scattering structures in addition to the local ones. Since the angular spread is a key factor of the second order statistics of fading processes in wireless communications, the thesis proposes a novel generalized method of quantifying the angular spread of the multipath power distribution. The proposed method provides almost all parameters about the angular spread, which can be further used for calculating more accurate spatial correlations and other statistics of multipath fading channels. The degree of accuracy in such correlation calculations can lead to the computation of exact separation distances among array elements required for maximizing capacity in MIMO systems or diversity antennas. The proposed method is also helpful in finding the exact standard deviation of the truncated angular distributions and angular data acquired in measurement campaigns. This thesis also indicates the significance of the effects of angular distribution truncation on the angular spread. Due to the importance of angular spread in the fading statistics, it is proposed as the goodness-of-fit measure in measurement campaigns. In this regard, comparisons of some notable azimuthal models with the measurement results are shown. The effect of mobile motion on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the channel is also discussed. Three mobile motion scenarios are presented, which can be considered to be responsible for the variations of the spatio-temporal statistical parameters of the multipath signals. Two different cases are also identified, when the terrain and clutter of the mobile surroundings have an additional effect on the temporal spread of the channel during mobile motion. The effect of increasing mobile-base separation on the angular and temporal spreads is elaborated in detail. The proposed theoretical results in spatial characteristics can be extended to characterizing and tracking transient behavior of Doppler spread in time-varying fast fading channels; likewise the proposed theoretical results in temporal characteristics can be utilized in designing efficient equalizers for combating inter-symbol interference (ISI) in time-varying frequency-selective fading channels. In the last part of the thesis, a linear state-space model is developed for signature sequence adaptation over time-varying fast fading channels in DS-CDMA systems. A decision directed adaptive algorithm, based on the proposed state-space model and Kalman filter, is presented. The algorithm outperforms the gradient-based algorithms in tracking the received distorted signature sequence over time-varying fast fading channels. Simulation results are presented which show that the performance of a linear adaptive receiver can be improved significantly with signature tracking on high Doppler spreads in DS-CDMA systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering geology of the Patonga Claystone, Central Coast, New South Wales, with particular reference to slaking behaviour</field><field name="creator">Nunt-jaruwong, Sorawit, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Patonga Claystone, a red bed facies in the Narrabeen Group of the Sydney Basin, is one of the most unfavorable rock units in the basin from a geotechnical point of view. This rock unit is composed of sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and claystone. One of the unfavorable characteristics is the low shear strength, which causes instability of cut slopes; another is its slaking-prone behaviour. Numerous measurements of geotechnical properties, along with extensive mineralogical and geochemical determinations, were carried out to identify cause of this slaking behaviour. Key techniques were the use of quantitative X-ray diffractometry for mineralogical analysis, and the determination of slake durability index and related properties to evaluate the slaking behaviour under both standard and more extended conditions. Standard (two cycle) slake durability test results indicate a range from low to high slake durability index values, with some mudstone samples having very low durability and some sandstones having very high slake durability indices. Jar slake test results indicate that the rock samples break rapidly and/or develop several fractures (Ij = 4) in an as-received state, but degrade to a pile of flakes or mud (Ij = 1) if the samples are oven dried before testing. The results for jar slake testing of oven-dried material are comparable, for individual samples, to those obtained from the more comprehensive slake durability tests. The mineralogy of the samples was evaluated by quantitative X-ray diffraction techniques using the Rietveld-based Siroquant processing system. Comparison to independent chemical data show a generally good level of agreement, suggesting that the mineralogical analysis  results are consistent with the chemical composition of the individual rock samples. Good correlations were also obtained between clay mineralogy determined from orientedaggregate XRD analysis of the &amp;lt2 micron fraction and the results from powder diffractometry and Siroquant analysis of the whole-rock samples. Evaluation of the slake durability characteristics and other geotechnical properties in relation to the quantitative mineralogy suggests that quartz and feldspar form a rigid framework in the rocks that resists the disruptive pressures that cause slaking. Expansion of the clay minerals by various processes, including the incorporation of water into the interlayer spaces of illite/smectite as well as changes in pore pressures associated with entry of water into micro-fractures in the clay matrix, are thought to produce the disruptions that cause slaking and degradation. An abundant clay matrix also reduces the strength of the rock materials, probably because of the less rigid nature of the clay minerals relative to the quartz and feldspar particles. As well as the mineralogy, the loss on ignition (LOI) and water absorption percentage were found to provide good indicators of longer-term slaking behaviour. Both properties are also related to the overall clay content. Rock samples with water absorption values of &amp;lt10, 10-15 and &amp;gt15% behave as highly durable, intermediate and less durable materials respectively. Rocks with LOI values of greater than 5% by weight behave as less durable rock materials, at least for the strata encompassed by the present study. The water absorption and LOI values were also used to develop a predictive model of slake durability characteristics for the different rock materials in the Patonga Claystone, providing a relatively simple basis for predicting longer-term stability in a range of geotechnical studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering geology -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="subject">Tonsteins</field><field name="subject">Sandstone -- New South Wales -- Sydney Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27335</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An agent-based approach to dialogue management in personal assistants</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Thuc Anh, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Personal assistants need to allow the user to interact with the system in a flexible and adaptive way such as through spoken language dialogue. This research is aimed at achieving robust and effective dialogue management in such applications. We focus on an application, the Smart Personal Assistant (SPA), in which the user can use a variety of devices to interact with a collection of personal assistants, each specializing in a task domain. The current implementation of the SPA contains an e-mail management agent and a calendar agent that the user can interact with through a spoken dialogue and a graphical interface on PDAs. The user-system interaction is handled by a Dialogue Manager agent.  We propose an agent-based approach that makes use of a BDI agent architecture for dialogue modelling and control. The Dialogue Manager agent of the SPA acts as the central point for maintaining coherent user-system interaction and coordinating the activities of the assistants. The dialogue model consists of a set of complex but modular plans for handling communicative goals. The dialogue control flow emerges automatically as the result of the agent???s plan selection by the BDI interpreter. In addition the Dialogue Manager maintains the conversational context, the domainspecific knowledge and the user model in its internal beliefs.  We also consider the problem of dialogue adaptation in such agent-based dialogue systems. We present a novel way of integrating learning into a BDI architecture so that the agent can learn to select the most suitable plan among those applicable in the current context. This enables the Dialogue Manager agent to tailor its responses according to the conversational context and the user???s physical context, devices and preferences.  Finally, we report the evaluation results, which indicate the robustness and effectiveness of the dialogue model in handling a range of users.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spoken dialogues</field><field name="subject">dialogue management</field><field name="subject">BDI agents</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">natural language processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/28241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scratch-pad memory management for static data aggregates</field><field name="creator">Li, Lian, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scratch-pad memory (SPM), a fast on-chip SRAM managed by software, is widely used in embedded systems. Compared to hardware-managed cache, SPM can be more efficient in performance, power and area cost, and has the added advantage of better time predictability. In this thesis, SPMs should be seen in a general context. For example, in stream processors, a software-managed stream register file is usually used to stage data to and from off-chip memory. In IBM's Cell architecture, each co-processor has a software-managed local store for keeping data and instructions.  SPM management is critical for SPM-based embedded systems. In this thesis, we propose two novel methodologies, the memory colouring methodology and the perfect colouring methodology, to place the static data aggregates such as arrays and structs of a program in SPM. Our methodologies are dynamic in the sense that some data aggregates can be swapped into and out of SPM during program execution. To this end, a live range splitting heuristic is introduced in order to create potential data transfer statements between SPM and off-chip memory.  The memory colouring methodology is a general-purpose compiler approach. The novelty of this approach lies in partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file then generalising existing graph colouring algorithms for register allocation to colour data aggregates. In this thesis, a scheme for partitioning an SPM into a pseudo register file is introduced. This methodology is inter-procedural and therefore operates on the interference graph for the data aggregates in the whole program. Different graph colouring algorithms may give rise to different results due to live range splitting and spilling heuristics used. As a result, two representative graph colouring algorithms, George and Appel's iterative-coalescing and Park and Moon's optimistic-coalescing, are generalised and evaluated for SPM allocation.  Like memory colouring, perfect colouring is also inter-procedural. The novelty of this second methodology lies in formulating the SPM allocation problem as an interval colouring problem. The interval colouring problem is an NP problem and no widely-accepted approximation algorithms exist. The key observation is that the interference graphs for data aggregates in many embedded applications form a special class of superperfect graphs. This has led to the development of two additional SPM allocation algorithms. While differing in whether live range splits and spills are done sequentially or together, both algorithms place data aggregates in SPM based on the cliques in an interference graph. In both cases, we guarantee optimally that all data aggregates in an interference graph can be placed in SPM if the given SPM size is no smaller than the chromatic number of the graph.  We have developed two memory colouring algorithms and two perfect colouring algorithms for SPM allocation. We have evaluated them using a set of embedded applications. Our results show that both methodologies are efficient and effective in handling large-scale embedded applications. While neither methodology outperforms the other consistently, perfect colouring has yielded better overall results in the set of benchmarks used in our experiments. All these algorithms are expected to be valuable. For example, they can be made available as part of the same compiler framework to assist the embedded designer with exploring a large number of optimisation opportunities for a particular embedded application.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scratch-pad memory.</field><field name="subject">Compiler.</field><field name="subject">Embedded computer systems.</field><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of performance measurement of safety systems in construction.</field><field name="creator">Naik, Nitin, CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Australia, the measurement of safety performance in the construction industry has mostly been in response to statutory requirements. Consequently, the measures and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used by the industry have invariably focused on outcomes rather than processes. Most of the outcome indicators have tended to give their feedback well after the event therefore failing to identify any weaknesses within the safety management processes. In order to overcome these limitations, two hospital construction projects in New South Wales were selected for an in-depth study and research analysis. The aim of the research was to understand the relationship between management process intervention and management process outcomes for safety in the construction industry. Initially a literature review identifying international practices in performance measurement for safety in construction was conducted so as to review existing safety management processes in partnership with the construction industry representatives.  A framework for measuring the performance of safety management processes and related outcomes was developed to stimulate improvement on both projects through the comparison of the performance of the safety management systems and outcomes.  This framework was then implemented and established to monitor the performance of the key safety management processes. The successful implementation of the performance measurement framework and the feedback to both stakeholders and subcontractors acted as a good communication tool in creating awareness among subcontractors.  It also helped to reduce repetitive hazards, resulting in improved safety outcomes. A statistical analysis found that relatively few injuries were explained by the identified safety hazards.  This highlighted the need to look for hazards that were specifically relate to injury occurrence.  The research findings identified a method for improving the existing hazard identification process.  It is anticipated that such improvements can help to better correlate hazard management processes with the project outcomes for safety in future projects.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SAFETY SYSTEMS</field><field name="subject">PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT</field><field name="subject">CONSTRUCTION</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reuse of industrial products - a technical and economic model for decision support</field><field name="creator">Anityasari, Maria, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the field of sustainable manufacturing, a wide range of research has been carried out to attain the more effective use of natural resources and the reduction of environmental impacts during the whole product life cycle. This goal can be best achieved by promoting multiple-reuse of parts, sub-assemblies, or entire products. However, the decision toward reusing an old product depends on a variety of parameters with many uncertainties. Therefore, a comprehensive model to assess the reusability of products prior to the reuse decision is urgently needed. The objective of this research has been to develop a comprehensive assessment model, integrating technical, environmental, social, and economic aspects to evaluate the reusability of industrial products. The assessment model consists of four sub-models, which are a methodology to assess the quality and reliability of products, a model to translate the social responsibility aspect into warranty cost, a methodology to integrate environmental costs, and an economic model to accumulate total life cycle cost as the basis of the evaluation. The model also facilitates trade-offs between the factors to investigate the possibility to improve the reusability of a product. To apply the assessment model in the real business environment, a set of decisionmaking methodologies under different take-back scenarios has been developed as a guideline for manufacturers. Furthermore, as the existence of uncertainty in the reuse strategy is undeniable, a methodology to integrate uncertainties into the assessment model is also developed. The model validation, using three real cases collected from industrial partners on consumer and commercial products, has confirmed the applicability of the model to provide a useful tool to evaluate products at the end of their life cycle. The model also enables decision makers to disclose the risk associated with the decision, thus improving the quality of the decision. The results are in good agreement with the basic theory that the reuse and remanufacturing strategy is highly recommended from both environmental and economic reasons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making -- Methodology</field><field name="subject">Remanufacturing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating five models of dissemination of NHMRC 'Guideline depression in young people for GP's' through divisions of general practice</field><field name="creator">Penrose-Wall, Jonine., Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Dissemination of evidence-based mental health clinical practice guidelines had not been studied in Australia prior to the National General Practice Guideline Implementation Program. This naturalistic research reports ten national interventions designed to disseminate the NHMRC 1997 Clinical Practice Guideline Depression in Young People for GPs (GDIYP-GP) through 123 Divisions of General Practice. The guideline covered depression and suicide in young people aged 13 to 20 years. Aim: To evaluate a 'coordinated link agent' and 'enhanced packaged approach' for disseminating a national guideline by engaging 20 Divisions in using 5 dissemination models and to measure Divisions' capacities in performing unfunded local dissemination to GPs. Method: An Implementation Kit was the main national intervention, housing the guidelines and 5 models: Education by the Division; Education by an external provider; 3) Clinical Audit; 4) Segmented Formats and 5) Appraisal. Five studies are reported: 1) an organisational census on guideline-related practices in all topics; 2) a Case Study Database of 3 consecutive interviews of 51 participating Divisions; 3) a Guideline Appraisal study of 9 cohorts of doctors; 4) a Clinical Audit study of 54 doctors involving 1200 patients; and 5) a 'Segmented Formats' documentary analysis of Division communications on GDIYP-GP. Results: Prior dissemination by most Divisions was administrative mail outs rather than planned programs. In all, 70 instead of the pilot 20 organisations participated (57% of the sector) using 10,000 guidelines: 45 participated by 7 weeks and 71 by 35 weeks and the majority used multiple active strategies showing fidelity to the Kit. Education by the Division, Segmented Formats and Appraisal were the most adopted models. GDIYP-GP was acceptable and relevant to the majority of Divisions and to 9 samples of doctors. Conclusion: Divisions are one appropriate system through which evidence-based mental health guidelines can be disseminated to general practitioners. Uptake can be rapid using a flexible enhanced package approach with link-agent support. 3-6 months is needed for organisations to begin effective interventions.

Undrained and drained triaxial compression tests, one dimensional consolidation, high stress compression, and unconfined compression tests were performed on artificially prepared lightly cemented loose samples with cement-sand ratios of 2, 4 and 6%. Additional tests were also conducted on uncemented samples prepared at the same initial void ratio as the cemented samples. Besides the influence of degree of cementation, the effects of void ratio and confining pressure on the liquefaction potential of cemented sands were examined. The aim of this study is to make significant contribution to the understanding of static liquefaction failures in lightly cemented sands. It is shown that cementation could increase the initial stiffness and yield strength of cemented sands but its effect might decrease considerably after the peak strength because of destruction of the cementation bond. The response of cemented sands at lower cement contents was very similar to the response of loose sands and behaviour approached the response of medium to dense sands with increase in the degree of cementation. It is also shown that degree of cementation has a significant influence on liquefaction resistance. Even though the presence of small amounts of cementation did not prevent liquefaction failure, the liquefaction resistance of cemented sands generally increased for higher degrees of cementation.  The consolidation, high stress compression and unconfined compression tests demonstrated the effect of cementation in increasing both the stiffness and strength of cemented sands. The unconfined compression strength increased approximately linearly with the increase in cement content. The rate of strength gain increased with an increase in the dry density of the compacted sample, indicating that the cementation was more for denser samples.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cementation.</field><field name="subject">cemented sands.</field><field name="subject">liquefaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition</field><field name="creator">Straub, Axel, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si, grain size &gt; 1??m, no amorphous tissue) on glass is an interesting material for thin-film solar cells due to the low costs, the abundance and the non-toxic character of Si, and the properties of pc-Si like long-term stability and lateral conductance. Glass as supporting material significantly complicates the fabrication process as it limits the thermal budget and the maximum temperature. In this work, the feasibility of forming large-grained pc-Si thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition (IAD) on aluminium-induced crystallisation (AIC) seed layers (ALICIA solar cells) is investigated. IAD allows epitaxial growth at high rate, and being based on evaporation, is of low cost (high source material usage, no toxic gases involved). High-quality epitaxy on (100)-oriented Si wafer substrates is demonstrated in a non{UHV environment, to further increase its industrial appli- cability. High{rate growth and a sacrificial protective layer control contamination problems associated with the non-UHV environment. The process is then trans- ferred to AIC-seeded glass and optimised, with particular focus on the influence of the glass. Using high-temperature rapid thermal annealing and hydrogenation as post-deposition treatments, ALICIA solar cells with a 1-Sun open-circuit voltage of 420 mV are achieved. Moreover, two novel characterisation techniques are presented. One allows the fast and non-destructive assessment of the structural quality of pc-Si films using opti- cal measurements. Furthermore, `impedance analysis', a novel capacitance-voltage measurement technique based on impedance spectroscopy, is presented. It allows the reliable determination of the absorber layer doping density and the built{in potential of non-ideal p-n junction solar cells. The latter is used to investigate the influence of post{deposition treatments on the n-type absorber layer doping of ALICIA solar cells. It is found, using temperature dependent impedance analysis, that unintentional doping and defects have a strong influence on the absorber layer doping. A maximum in the short-circuit current density of ALICIA solar cells is found for phosphorus concentrations in the absorber of 1??1017 cm??3. For such ALI- CIA cells a base difusion length in the range 600 - 950nm, a short{circuit current density in the range 10 - 13.5 mA/cm2 and an energy conversion efficiency of 2.2% are obtained.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating non???pedagogical sociability of asynchronous computer supported collaborative learning environments</field><field name="creator">Abedin, Babak , Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">While technologically Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) systems have been considerably improved, previous studies have shown that the social aspect of CSCL is often neglected or assumed to happen automatically just by creating such virtual learning environments. Several studies on the other hand showed sociability of CSCL environments strongly relate to online learning enjoyment and effectiveness of learning. Social interactions in CSCL can be broadly categorized as pedagogical/on-task and non-pedagogical/non-task interactions. Accordingly, this thesis investigates the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL environments and primarily demonstrates that non-pedagogical/non-task interactions do occur in these environments. In addition, this thesis operationalizes the notion of non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL environments and determines factors that impact on it. A multi method approach for data collection and analysis is used. Results of a content analysis extend the Transcript Analysis Tool (TAT) instrument, the tool used for the content analysis, and show the presence and pattern of a substantial amount of nonpedagogical social exchanges occur in both virtual task-related as well as non-taskrelated spaces. The findings from the survey data, on the other hand, support the SIP theory and SIDE theory predictions and revealed that the sense of cohesion and awareness of others significantly impact on the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the perception of self-representation and perception of compatibility affect the sense of cohesion and awareness of others and indirectly contribute to the perceived non-pedagogical sociability of the environment. The findings of this thesis can be used in future research for investigating the relationship between the non-pedagogical sociability of CSCL and other CSCL factors. It also provides CSCL lecturers and facilitators with a conceptual model by which sociability can be explicitly addressed in their course planning and delivery processes. From a practical point of view, this study develops and validates an instrument that guides required changes in the CSCL for improving the non-pedagogical social functionality of the environment. The findings also stress the importance of virtual spaces in CSCL design exercises in order to provide opportunities for students to have non-task discussions and to reflect on their own and others??? experiences and ideas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociability</field><field name="subject">Computer supported collaborative learning</field><field name="subject">Social computing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Daily as required:children&#146;s self&#8208;management of (extra)ordinary asthma in the family context</field><field name="creator">Tudball, Jacqueline Joy, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents a new model of how children self-manage asthma with their parents. Traditional models of children's asthma self-management (CASM) rely on notions of adherence to medical regimens and consider parents to have primary responsibility for their children's health. However, children have primary control over the key CASM strategy: the self administered inhaler. This study investigated how children self-manage asthma, the tools they use and how they undertake shared responsibility for CASM with their parents.  Employing sociological theories of children and childhood, a grounded theoretical, mixed method research design was employed to analyse data from multiple sources: primary qualitative data from interviews conducted with eight children (n = 8, age 7 -12 years) and their parents; interviews with two parents of infants; and secondary quantitative data from the 2001 NSW Child Health Survey (CHS01).  Clear delineation was found between child and parent responsibilities. Responsibilities are responsive and adaptable according to the nature of the asthma event. There is consensus between children and parents as to what their responsibilities should be. Asthma is familiar, recognisable and usually easy to manage, particularly as children&#146;s own actions are central to CASM. Thus, children considered asthma a predominantly 'ordinary' experience. 'Ordinary' tools include inhalers and non asthma-specific activities, such as resting. Parental responsibility focused on monitoring and reminding children of 'ordinary' CASM tasks. During frightening asthma events - such as night-time episodes and hospitalisation - children abdicated primary responsibility for CASM to their parents. 'Extraordinary' tools include nebulisers, oral medications and hospital. During 'extraordinary' asthma, the parental role is primary and includes responsibility for action and decision-making. While not considered 'ordinary', children nonetheless described frightening events in a way that accommodates asthma within schema for everyday life. Parents also described the '(extra) ordinariness' of asthma, but expressed greater anxiety for their children's future. This, plus the vigilance necessary for parents to monitor their child's condition, appeared to problematise asthma more for parents than for children. This was supported by results from parent-reported CHS01 analyses.  This new model of CASM is discussed with respect to its implications for public health self management programs, guidelines and future research.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="subject">Self-management</field><field name="subject">Ordinariness</field><field name="subject">Chronic illness</field><field name="subject">Grounded Theory</field><field name="subject">New South Wales Child Health Survey 2001</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quantitative proteomics investigation of cold adaptation in the marine bacterium, Sphinopyxis alaskensis</field><field name="creator">Ting, Lily Li Jing, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The marine bacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis was isolated as one of the most numerically abundant bacteria from cold (4&#150;10??C) nutrient depleted waters in the North Pacific Ocean. The objective of this study was to examine cold adaptation of S. alaskensis by using proteomics to examine changes in global protein levels caused by growth at low (10??C) and high (30??C) temperatures. Stable isotope labelling-based quantitative proteomics was used, and a rigorous post-experimental data processing workflow adapted from microarray-based methods was developed. The approach included metabolic labelling with 14N/15N and normalisation and statistical testing of quantitative proteomics data.  Approximately 400,000 tandem mass spectra were generated resulting in the confident identification of 2,135 proteins (66% genome coverage) and the quantitation of 1,172 proteins (37% genome coverage). Normalisation approaches were evaluated using cultures grown at 30??C and labelled with 14N and 15N. For 10??C vs. 30??C experiments, protein quantities were normalised within each experiment using a multivariate lowess approach. Statistical significance was assessed by combining data from all experiments and applying a moderated t-test using the empirical Bayes method with the limma package in R. Proteins were ranked after calculating the B-statistic and the Storey-Tibshirani false discovery rate. 217 proteins (6% genome coverage) were determined to have significant quantitative differences. In achieving these outcomes a range of factors that impact on quantitative proteomics data quality were broadly assessed, resulting in the development of a robust approach that is generally applicable to quantitative proteomics of biological system.  The significantly differentially abundant proteins from the proteomics data provided insight into molecular mechanisms of cold adaptation in S. alaskensis. Important aspects of cold adaptation included cell membrane restructuring, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, lipid degradation, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, and increased capacity of transcriptional and translational processes. A number of cold adaptive responses in S. alaskensis were novel, including a specific cold-active protein folding pathway, a possible thermally-controlled stringent response, and biosynthesis of intracellular polyhydroxyalkanoate reserve material.  The overall study provided important new insight into the evolution of growth strategies necessary for the effective competition of S. alaskensis in cold, oligotrophic environments.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cold adaptation</field><field name="subject">Quantitative proteomics</field><field name="subject">Extremophiles</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I don???t mind being a diabetic but not every day!: learning to live with a chronic condition</field><field name="creator">Demirkol, Abdullah, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic conditions and their management have become a major global public health problem which poses a serious challenge for both health care systems and affected individuals. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition affecting almost 200 million people around the world, a number that is expected to double by 2020. As with most chronic conditions its management requires significant and permanent changes in people???s daily life practices as well as a strict medication regimen. Recent research demonstrates that it is possible to control the complications of diabetes, and even to prevent its development in predisposed individuals by following recommended treatments. Yet studies show that only 2% of people living with diabetes heed their treating team???s advice. This signals a serious discordance between scientifically generated information and its place in the daily lives of people living with diabetes. This study sought to discover how to change the factors that prevent people with type 2 diabetes from following their recommended treatments. Firstly a participant observation process in four diabetes education centres was used to define the characteristics of the context in which people with diabetes and their treating teams interacted. This was followed by a nine-month participatory action process in two of the four centres in which participants defined the problematic areas in the management of their diabetes and devised plans to tackle these problems. They then attempted to implement these plans while exploring how and why their plans did or did not work. The findings indicate that the decision to follow recommended treatments is far from being a matter of individual choice. Rather it is heavily influenced by a complex interaction of numerous factors that people with diabetes have limited power to change. This study reveals that the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes could be enhanced where operational and practical knowledge about the condition is provided to people living with the disorder by health care providers responsive to patients??? perspectives, and where patients, providers and policy-makers recognise that health is a resource constructed in the wider social context, whose every element needs to be harnessed in encouraging people to make healthier life decisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsibility and accountability in theory and practice: the truth and reconciliation commission???s investigation of human rights abuse in South Africa</field><field name="creator">Carman, Marina, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aims of the investigation conducted here are to draw out important debates in theory and in the South African social context over the concepts of responsibility and accountability for human rights abuse, and to look at how these were present within, and impacted on, discussions within and around the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC did not specifically discuss or define theoretical concepts of responsibility or accountability. However, I argue that it is possible to draw out some important features of its implicit approach ??? particularly in terms of its emphasis on collective responsibility and social context (in addition to individual responsibility), and its emphasis on moral arguments for individuals and collectives to accept responsibility and hold themselves accountable by contributing to future change. This ambitious and complex approach raised some important theoretical issues, which have been discussed and debated in the theoretical literature. These include: the relationship between individual responsibility, collective responsibility and the influence of ???the system???; the nature of collective responsibility; the nature of morality; the distinction between moral and political responsibility; and how individuals and collectives can or should be held accountable. In South Africa, these theoretical debates inter-mingled with a range of other factors, including individual and collective interests, motives and political perspectives. From an analysis of the existing literature on the TRC and original interviews conducted with key informants, I draw out three main opposing views which I argue arose in the South African social context about responsibility and accountability, and what the TRC could and should have done to address these. In a detailed analysis of the TRC???s hearings and Final Report, I draw out how theoretical debates, and these three opposing views, were present within and impacted on the TRC???s work. I argue that it was impossible for the TRC to satisfy everyone and resolve these debates, and that its approach led to unrealistic expectations of its work and its role more generally. This has impacted negatively on how the TRC was and is perceived.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a model for patients??? acceptance of a home telecare management system</field><field name="creator">Rahimpour, Mohammadreza, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Successful implementation of any technology requires acceptance by the users. Numerous studies in the area of information technology acceptance, based on wellknown theories have been conducted to examine technology acceptance models and predict user adoption/acceptance behaviour. There are several studies dealing with patients??? acceptance of different telemedicine applications, but few about the patients??? acceptance of home telecare. Most existing studies are not based on a strong theoretical framework. In this study, based on an extensive literature review and preliminary qualitative data, a theoretical model of the effect of Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) characteristics and psychological variables associated with technophobia on patients??? acceptance of HTMS is proposed. The proposed model is an augmented Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1986), which is called Home Telecare Management System acceptance model (HTMS-AM), in which TAM has been augmented by two constructs: HTMS anxiety and HTMS self-efficacy. The model is proposed to improve our understanding regarding patients??? acceptance of HTMS, which may lead to successful design and implementation of home telecare systems. In addition, it can be used as a theoretical basis to evaluate new generations of HTMS in terms of users acceptance in the early stage of their design and development even prior to implementation. In order to test the reliability and validity of the measures, video demonstrations of a home telecare system and demonstration of a system prototype to potential users was employed. To propose the HTMS-AM the following five stages were taken: 1. General well-known theoretical models of human behaviour from psychology and technology acceptance models from information technology were reviewed to create a basic template for the proposed model. 2. A preliminary study (focus group interviews, Chapter 5) was conducted to assess patients??? perceptions of HTMS.  3. Based on an extensive literature review and findings from preliminary qualitative studies, HTMS acceptance model was proposed, to improve our understanding about factors, which may affect patients??? intention to use HTMS. Several adaptations were applied in the model to be applicable in the HTMS context, such as augmenting the model with HTMS self-efficacy and HTMS anxiety constructs. 4. To measure the different psychological variables in the proposed model, valid and reliable measures from previous studies were used. However the preliminary study was used to develop measures, which did not exist in the literature. 5. These measures were tested in the final study. The subjects were patients who had been affected with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and/or Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD). Given the chronic nature of these diseases, the necessity for extended monitoring and management and frequent admission to hospitals due to worsening health status, these patients were deemed the most appropriate candidates for the HTMS. Further studies with more cases need to be conducted to test the actual model in which the impact of HTMS characteristics, psychological and demographic factors associated with technophobia upon intention to use the HTMS and the correlation of these factors with each other in appropriate healthcare settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Post-compulsory curriculum reform and teachers' work: A critical policy ethnography in a Western Australian State Secondary school</field><field name="creator">coble-neal@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">This thesis set out to examine how teachers understand, experience and respond to mandated curriculum reforms in English in years 11 and 12 at a Senior High School in Western Australia over the period 2004 &#150; 2005. The time period is significant as it is a halfway point between the commencement of the new policy driving reform of senior secondary education and the partial settlement of the policy and curriculum reform. The research is conceptualised using labour process theory as a means of analysing how teachers are being separated from their intellectual work throughout this curriculum reform process. The methodology chosen to inform this research is a dual approach using critical ethnography of lived individual experiences and critical policy ethnography to analyse the changing landscape of education policy in Australia. This dual approach offers a system level of understanding of mandated curriculum reform with an emphasis on the individual experience of expert teachers implementing the contested curriculum reform.

Several central themes emerged over the course of the research: growing deprofessionalisation of teachers&#146; work; intensification of workload and curriculum creation; technocratisation of teacher roles; diminishing autonomy, increased accountability and responsibility; and heightened external surveillance and control. Significantly, the data also captured and analysed in this research demonstrates how teachers are continually experiencing the processes of reprofessionalisation as a consequence of sustained critical reflective practice and the imposition of mandated curriculum reform. The data also relates the need for an authentic consultation between teachers and policy makers/government authorities in order for curriculum reform to be successfully established and taken up in secondary State schools. The processes of reprofessionalisation are a source of continued professional renewal and reinvigoration for the teachers involved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">curriculum</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">policy research</field><field name="subject">labour process theory</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20091117.130012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How Does the Pre-weaning Environment Affect Gut Structure and Function, and Lifetime Performance of the Pig?</field><field name="creator">hugh.payne@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">The reduction in feed intake and growth rate that occurs following weaning is of major economic consequence to the pig industry.  Currently, a range of antimicrobial products can be used to minimise the impact of weaning on piglet health and subsequent performance.  However, the use of these products in pig diets is subject to increasing restriction worldwide because of perceived risks to public health and to the environment.  Thus, alternative methods are required to mitigate the growth check that almost invariably occurs after weaning in most production systems.
Piglets produced outdoors are claimed to experience less of a growth check at weaning and to be able to thrive in relatively unsophisticated weaner accommodation.  However, these claims have not been substantiated under Western Australian conditions, nor a scientific basis for these claims established.  Consequently, a series of experiments was designed to test the general hypothesis for this thesis &#150; &#145;the gut structure and function, and lifetime performance of the weaned pig are affected by its pre- and post-weaning rearing environments&#146;.
Experiment 1 was conducted in two parts to quantify differences in the growth performance, health and gut structure of weaner pigs produced indoors or outdoors and reared in conventional or deep-litter pens.  The weaner diet in the first part of the experiment contained 100 ppm of olaquindox and 3,000 ppm of zinc oxide (Exp1a).  This experiment was repeated without using dietary antimicrobial products (Exp1b).  Experiment 2 was conducted in conventional buildings to examine the effect of exposing piglets in lactation to similar substrates to those available to outdoor piglets used in Exp1a and Exp1b in the absence of other differences in the outdoor production milieu.
Pre-weaning environments in Exp1a (indoor production (IP) and outdoor production (OP)) appeared to have little effect on gut structure and overall growth rate but significantly affected carcass composition, whereas post-weaning environments (conventional (C) or deep-litter (DL)) affected both overall growth rate and carcass composition.  Although feed disappearance was similar, OP pigs grew faster than IP pigs in the first 47 d after weaning in Exp1a but not in Exp1b.  Lifetime growth rate (GR), P2 backfat, feed disappearance and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were not significantly affected by the production environment in Exp1a whereas OP pigs grew slower with higher P2 backfat and FCR in Exp1b.  Interestingly, OP pigs had heavier carcass weights and higher dressing percentages than IP pigs in both parts of the experiment.  The effects of post-weaning environment were more consistent as DL pigs grew faster, were fatter, and had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than C pigs.
Villus height and crypt depth of IP and OP pigs were not different at 21 (weaning) or 28 d, but villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning.  Pigs reared in C pens had greater faecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids than pigs in DL, indicating that the latter ingested sufficient straw to alter fermentation characteristics.
In Experiment 2, there were no differences in gut structure or pre-weaning and lifetime GR of pigs offered no creep feed (NC), a commercial creep feed (CF) or an &#145;outdoor&#146; mix (OM) comprising of 1 part straw, 5 parts sow feed and 25 parts of soil taken from paddocks in which OP pigs used in Exp1a and Exp1b were farrowed.  However, NC pigs grew slower in the week after weaning than the other two treatments.  Backfat and feed disappearance were similar for all treatments but pigs on the OM treatment had higher carcass weights and dressing percentages than pigs on the NC and CF treatments.  Villus height and crypt depth were not different between treatments and, although the piglets were weaned at 28 d, villus height decreased and crypt depth increased in the week after weaning to an extent similar to that experienced by piglets weaned at 21 d in Experiment 1.
Although all piglets received intramuscular injections of 200 mg iron (Fe) dextran when 1 to 2 days old, piglets offered the OM during lactation had higher serum iron and blood haemoglobin (Hb) levels than those offered NC or CF.  Furthermore, half the piglets offered NC or CF had Hb levels indicative of chronic Fe deficiency anaemia.  The average parity of sows used in this experiment was 6.3 litters, suggesting that piglets may have been born with low Fe stores, possibly because of low Fe stores in their dams due to sub-optimal mineral nutrition over successive parities.
In summary, the findings from these experiments partly supported the general hypothesis for this thesis.  Under the conditions of these experiments, access to outdoor substrates in lactation had little effect on gut structure and lifetime growth rate but increased both carcass weight and dressing percentage, whereas rearing in DL pens increased feed intake, FCR, growth rate, P2 backfat, carcass weight and dressing percentage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pigs</field><field name="subject">weaning</field><field name="subject">housing system</field><field name="subject">lifetime performance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100325.153420</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemispheric Contributions to Language Comprehension: Word and Message-level Processing Mechanisms of the Right Cerebral Hemisphere.</field><field name="creator">B.Gouldthorp@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Recent research into hemispheric differences in sentence comprehension has produced a puzzling disparity between the results from behavioral studies on neurologically normal individuals and studies utilizing other methods such as electrophysiology, neuroimaging and the investigation of neuropsychological patients. The former approach tends to produce results that indicate a restriction of the right hemisphere (RH) to lower-level processing mechanisms that are comparatively less sensitive to context than the left hemisphere (LH), while the combined findings of the latter approaches suggest that not only is the RH capable of processing language at a higher level, it is particularly sensitive to contextual information and, furthermore, this may form part of the special role of the RH in language tasks.  Accordingly, the present series of studies employed a normal-behavioral approach to further investigate the underlying processing mechanisms of the RH during sentence comprehension tasks.  In each of the four experiments, right-handed adult participants completed a computer-based lexical decision task where reaction time and error rates were recorded.  Stimuli were always centrally-presented, followed by a laterally-presented target word or non-word. In the first experiment, the sensitivity of the RH to message-level meaning was investigated by assessing whether it benefits from additional contextual information in sentences that was not the result of simple word-level associations.  The remaining experiments aimed to examine several current models of RH language processing; specifically, they examined the applicability of the coarse-coding hypothesis (Beeman, 1993) and the integrative processing model (Federmeier, 2007) to RH sentence processing.  The combined results of the four experiments lead to several conclusions. Firstly, this series of investigation consistently demonstrated that the RH does display a sensitivity to message-level processing that appears to be at least equivalent to that of the LH.  This conclusion is uncommon in the normal-behavioral literature, but is consistent with evidence produced by other methodologies.  Secondly, the coarse-coding hypothesis is insufficient in explaining RH language processing at the sentential level.  Although there is considerable evidence in support of the coarse-coding model of RH processing of individual words, the findings of the present investigations do not support its applicability beyond this level.  Thirdly, the integrative/predictive distinction between RH/LH language processing also appears to have limited applicability beyond sentence fragments and may instead be reflective of higher-level processing differences (e.g., wherein the RH may utilize a para-linguistic situation-model processing method whereas the LH may rely purely on a linguistic mechanism).  Based on these conclusions, the present series of investigations appears to have resolved the inconsistent finding previously prominent in normal-behavioral literature and goes some way in determining the applicability of current models of RH language processing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sentence comprehension</field><field name="subject">language</field><field name="subject">hemisphere</field><field name="subject">priming</field><field name="subject">context</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100325.85313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporations and the Discourse of Sustainability</field><field name="creator">M.Gollagher@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">The contemporary notion of sustainability is emerging as a political response to ecological and social problems associated with human development.  It is a contested concept - eco-modernists interpret it as a call to rethink or adjust industrial production systems while others interpret it as a fundamental challenge to the dominant development paradigm.  

Corporations are playing a key role in shaping the discourse.  Many argue that since corporations have enormous influence in the global political economy, they must take the lead in the search for sustainability.  The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) promotes eco-efficiency - an eco-modernist stance - as the primary business contribution to sustainability.  However, the potential of the corporate focus on efficiency to contribute to sustainability is a subject of debate.   

In this thesis, I use a heterogeneous methodological approach to explore the interaction between corporations (with a focus on multinational corporations) and the discourse of sustainability in order to identify the potential for positive outcomes.  I consider the compatibility of aspects of corporate identity and organisational structure to the ethos of sustainability.  This leads to an examination of the meeting between corporations and sustainability as a reflexive process, paying particular attention to the ways in which language and mythology serve to uphold or transform existing power relations.  I also explore forms of knowledge relevant to sustainability, comparing those that are typically emphasized in corporate enterprise with traditional, Indigenous and local ways of knowing that are essential to sustainability.  The knowledge of classical equestrianism is used as an example in this analysis.  Practical ways of including all these essential perspectives in the discourse are considered.

The thesis concludes that certain aspects of corporate identity, structure and function are incompatible with the ideals of sustainability and that these disparities must be borne in mind as corporations attempt to embrace sustainability.  I contend that sustainability requires network approaches that integrate strong and weak relations as well as diverse values and forms of knowledge.  Sustainability can only be achieved with broad civic engagement that allows the synergistic combination of all values and knowledges relevant to sustainability.  Furthermore, I argue that while corporations&#146; orientation towards market-based strategies has significant potential to support sustainability, it is limited since the market is fundamentally constituted by a network of weak ties.  Therefore the thesis argues that while corporations can provide significant benefits in terms of sustainability, they cannot be expected to lead the sustainability agenda as it requires discursive plurality.  The efficacy of the corporate contribution to sustainability will be greatly enhanced if companies are guided by strong democratic processes of deliberation and community engagement.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporations</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">traditional and Indigenous knowledge</field><field name="subject">deliberative democracy</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100330.120930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Epidemiology and Control of Caseous Lymphadenitis in Australian Sheep Flocks</field><field name="creator">mpaton@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis was to better understand the epidemiology of caseous lymphadenitis (CLA) and its economic effects on the Australian sheep industries. The work also sought to apply this knowledge to better understand how to control the disease in Australian sheep flocks.

The occurrence of CLA in some other species, as a comparison to CLA in sheep, is described in the literature review. However a comprehensive review of research on CLA in all livestock species is not needed to meet the aims of the thesis.

The research used serological tests developed in the 1970s and &#145;80s to examine the epidemiology and costs of CLA in Western Australian sheep flocks. Epidemiological techniques were used to determine the main risk factors associated with high incidences of CLA. Controlled experimentation was used to better understand the spread of CLA within flocks. Prevalence data collected at abattoirs and survey techniques were employed to better understand how CLA was being controlled in Australian sheep flocks.

It was shown that toxin and cell wall ELISA tests for CLA were useful tools to study the spread of CLA in sheep flocks. Using the serological tests it was estimated that 80 per cent of CLA spread occurs after the second and third shearings. This knowledge was used to design a risk factor study which identified two significant factors associated with high CLA spread, that is in dips and close contact after shearing.

These tests also facilitated the study of new CLA infection on wool production. It was found that sheep produce approximately five per cent less clean wool in the year in which they are infected.

The main routes for the spread of CLA were from sheep with lung abscesses to those with skin cuts and through dips, rather than from an environment contaminated with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis bacteria.

A survey of sheep producers found that the prevalence of CLA had decreased from over 50% in the 1970s to approximately 20% in the late 1990s. It also found that current vaccines were being used inefficiently. Large increases in the efficiency of control can be achieved by approximately 70 per cent of producers by using commercially available vaccines and the recommended vaccination programs of two</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">chronic disease</field><field name="subject">Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100330.160814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of Phytophthora cinnamomi on the distribution of the yellow-footed antechinus (mardo) (Antechinus flavipes leucogaster) (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae)</field><field name="creator">R.Armistead@cesarconsultants.com.au</field><field name="description">This is the first study to investigate and provide definitive evidence that the plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi is a significant threat to the mammal fauna of Western Australia. This study investigated the impact of P. cinnamomi-induced habitat disturbance and degradation on Antechinus flavipes leucogaster (yellow-footed antechinus) or mardo. Phytophthora cinnamomi is an introduced and invasive soil-borne plant pathogen that kills many common and structurally important plant species, which results in significant changes to the structural characteristics of affected areas. An evaluation of P. cinnamomi affected and unaffected areas of the northern jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest revealed significant declines in the structure, composition and complexity of all areas affected by P. cinnamomi. Dieback Expression Score values ranged from a mean value of 1.88 &#177; 1.01 to 3.8 &#177; 0.41 at the P. cinnamomi affected sites, indicating a high degree of disturbance. A non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis using 16 habitat variables identified significant (ANISOM: R=0.343, P&lt;0.003) separation among affected and unaffected sites. A SIMPER analysis revealed that ground and shrub cover vegetation, small and total log densities, percentage leaf litter cover, and the densities of small, medium, tall single crowned and total Xanthorrhoea preissii were the greatest contributors separating affected and unaffected areas.

Presently, our understanding of how P. cinnamomi affects the fauna of Western Australia is limited. This providing a unique opportunity to examine how P. cinnamomi-induced disturbance impacts upon the mardo. The mardo is a small insectivorous marsupial that is regarded as being common and a habitat generalist that occupies a broad range of forest and woodland habitats throughout the south-west of Western Australia. Until the present study, the specific habitat requirements, and therefore the factors limiting the present distribution of the mardo have received little attention. Therefore, in addition to being the first study to evaluate the impact of P. cinnamomi on Western Australian fauna, this study also provides important information about the present distribution of the mardo. 

Detection-nondetection mark-release surveys conducted in P. cinnamomi affected and unaffected regions of the northern jarrah forest, revealed that although, mardos were recorded at most sites, the number of mardo individuals, captures and detections were considerably lower at P. cinnamomi affected areas. Patch Occupancy analysis, using an information theoretic approach, revealed that the probability of a mardo occupying a region of the northern jarrah forest affected by P. cinnamomi ranged from a likelihood of 0.0 to 25.0%, while in contrast there was a 41.0 to 51.0% likelihood of a mardo occurring among unaffected regions. This discovery supports the hypothesis that P. cinnamomi-induced habitat disturbance impacts upon the distribution of the mardo.

An evaluation of the micro-habitat features important to the mardo using Patch Occupancy modelling using an information theoretic approach identified large logs and X. preissii densities as positive contributors to the present distribution of the mardo in the northern jarrah forest. Indeed, the likelihood of a mardo occupying an area with large logs and dense patches of X. preissii ranged from 62.2% to 85.0%. In contrast, in the P. cinnamomi affected sites with lower X. preissii densities the patch occupancy probabilities ranged from 0.0% to 45.7%. Logs and X. preissii strongly contribute to the understorey and may increase nest locations and cover while offering protection from predators. Mardos may avoid P. cinnamomi affected areas because of lower X. preissii densities, which may result in fewer nest locations, reduced cover and an increased likelihood of predation. However, the results of the study must be treated as preliminary findings, therefore there may be additional environmental related or unrelated to P. cinnamomi factors that may also contribute to the occupancy rates of the mardo. Therefore, further studies and research on the ecology and biology of the mardo is strongly encouraged. Until this research is conducted, P. cinnamomi most be considered as significant threat to the conservation of the mardo. Therefore, the conservation of the mardo in the northern jarrah forest depends on limiting the spread and impact of P. cinnamomi, as well as the retention of large logs and tall X. preissii. Given that large logs and tall X. preissii contribute to the distribution of the mardo, strong consideration must be given to using these natural elements to rehabilitate the most severely disturbed areas of the northern jarrah forest. 

Consideration must be given to the conservation of other small and threatened mammal species that inhabit susceptible plant communities in the south-west of Western Australia. An understanding of how P. cinnamomi impacts on the mardo and other native mammals will contribute to our ability to control, protect and manage vulnerable communities and ecosystems in Western Australia. If the spread and impact of this pathogen is left unchecked, the ultimate consequence to the conservation of many small to medium native mammals that are dependant on structurally complex habitat may be devastating.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antechinus</field><field name="subject">Phytophthora</field><field name="subject">patch occupancy</field><field name="subject">disturbance</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100330.90319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utility of morphological, ITS molecular and combined datasets in estimating the phylogeny of the cortinarioid sequestrate fungi</field><field name="creator">anthony.francis@graduate.uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Molecular technology has shown the classical, morphologically defined groupings of sequestrate cortinarioid fungi to be artificial and in need of revision. However, these same molecular studies have highlighted morphological characters, such as spore shape and ornamentation, that have proved useful for distinguishing phylogenetically informative groups. This observation underpins the hypothesis of this study: that the numeric analysis of selected morphological characters can provide the same picture of the diversity of, and relationships among, sequestrate cortinarioid fungi as that recovered from phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequence data.

Sequestrate fungi are those in which the spores mature inside an enclosed fruit body, remaining there until the fruit body decomposes or is eaten. For the purposes of this thesis the following genera are considered to contain cortinarioid sequestrate fungi: Auritella, Cortinarius, Dermocybe, Descomyces, Hymenogaster, Hysterogaster, Inocybe, Protoglossum, Quadrispora, Setchelliogaster and Timgrovea. This thesis focussed on Australian representatives of these fungi to address the hypothesis outlined above.

Four analysis methods were applied to each of three datasets (morphological, rDNA and combined data) in a comparative approach to test the stated hypothesis. The four analysis methods were two multivariate methods: cluster analysis and ordination (by principal coordinates analysis), and two phylogenetic methods: maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis.

Low bootstrap support and Bayesian partition probabilities for phylogenetic analyses of the morphological data indicated this dataset had little to no phylogenetic signal discernable by parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Different analyses of the morphological data differed in the way they grouped the collections. The type of clustering method used affected the pattern of relationships recovered. The coding of the data had a much more substantial effect on the patterns of relatedness suggested by the multivariate analyses. Despite the low level of phylogenetic information and agreement between analyses of the morphological data it was found that some collections were consistently grouped together. This included the separation of the Cortinarius-like collections from the Descolea-like collections and the relatively consistent grouping of some pairs of collections and some larger groups. Thus, despite the limited phylogenetic signal of the small morphological dataset and the artefacts of coding, some relatively consistent groups were recovered. 

Separate analyses of the Cortinarius-, Descolea- and Hebeloma-like ITS sequences recovered similar patterns to published phylogenies. The inclusion of more sequestrate taxa and a greater sample of Australian collections than previous studies, indicated that both Timgrovea subgenera nest among the Descolea-like collections and that hitherto undiscovered lineages of Descolea-like fungi are represented among the collections in Australian herbaria. The Cortinarius-like fungi fall within clades recognised by published phylogenies. Similar topologies were supported by both Parsimony bootstrap and Bayesian partition probability values for analyses of the molecular data including the separation of Cortinarius-like collections from Descolea-like collections. However neither of these methods of analysis and evaluation yielded well-resolved deeper nodes for either of these two major clades. Comparable clades/clusters of Cortinarius- like and Descolea-like collections were found in all analyses of the molecular data. Thus phylogenetically distinct groups of cortinarioid sequestrate fungi could be consistently distinguished using ITS molecular data, but not confidently related to one another.

The ratio of molecular to morphological characters (741:16) meant the patterns observed for the combined analyses were more similar to those observed in analyses of the molecular data than those of the morphological data. This included the recovery of substantially similar clades/clusters to those recovered by analyses of the molecular data alone. The value of combining the morphological and molecular data as analysed is questioned despite the congruence of the datasets according to the Incongruence-Length Difference test. Differences between the molecular and combined datasets arose primarily where the molecular data grouped collections that were also grouped by the morphological data.

The numeric analysis of the selected morphological characters as carried out in this study did not recover the same pattern of groups and relationships among the cortinarioid sequestrate fungi as phylogenetic analyses of ITS data. The composition of groups recovered using the morphological data alone or as part of the combined dataset, and the relationships between those groups, differed from those recovered from the molecular data alone; although there were similarities between groups recovered from different datasets. The ability of this thesis to conclusively address its fundamental hypothesis was compromised by limitations of the study such as taxon sampling, character selection, character coding and the poor resolution of the ITS phylogeny. Acknowledging these limitations, and that some similar groups were recovered, the results of this thesis do not support its stated hypothesis that the numeric analysis of selected morphological characters can provide the same picture of the diversity of, and relationships among, sequestrate cortinarioid fungi as recovered from phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequence data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cortinarius</field><field name="subject">Thaxterogaster</field><field name="subject">Descolea</field><field name="subject">Descomyces</field><field name="subject">Protoglossum</field><field name="subject">Quadrispora</field><field name="subject">Setchelliogaster</field><field name="subject">Hymenogaster</field><field name="subject">taxonomy</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100330.91122</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Symbiotic Interactions of Geographically Diverse Annual and Perennial Trifolium spp. with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii</field><field name="creator">ronald.yates@agric.wa.gov.au</field><field name="description">Perennial clovers are being evaluated for their potential to reduce groundwater levels in Australian cropping zones where many soils are considered too acidic for reliable lucerne nodulation. However, the release of effective inocula for perennial clovers into such areas where sub clover is the predominant legume, could potentially compromise nitrogen fixation from this valuable annual clover if the symbiosis between the new inoculants and sub clover is not optimal. Studies were therefore designed to increase our understanding of these symbiotic interactions to optimise the management of legume-rhizobia interactions to extend (rather than restrict) the use of legumes in new environments.

To assist the understanding of interactions between clovers and their microsymbionts, a glasshouse-based study of the cross-inoculation characteristics of 38 strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii (R. l. trifolii) associated with 38 genotypes of annual and perennial Trifolium spp. from world centres of diversity was undertaken. Rhizobial isolates and clovers were assembled from South and equatorial Africa, North and South America and the Euro-Mediterranean regions. There was substantial specificity amongst the African clovers for effective nodulation. No strain of rhizobia from the South American perennial T. polymorphum, or from the Ethiopian clovers, was able to nodulate sub clover effectively, whilst less than 33% of the 18 strains from these regions could form nodules with the less promiscuous Mediterranean annual T. glanduliferum. Seventy of 476 cross-inoculation treatments examined did not nodulate, whilst 81 treatments clearly demonstrated effective nodulation. The remainder of the crossinoculation pairings revealed only partially effective or ineffective nodulation. Two barriers to effective nodulation were identified from the cross- inoculation study: a geographic barrier representing the broad centres of clover diversity, across which few host- strain combinations were effective; and within each region, a significant barrier to effective nodulation between an isolate from an annual host on a perennial host, or vice versa. Clovers and their rhizobia from within the Euro-Mediterranean region of diversity were more able to overlap the annual/perennial barrier than genotypes from the other regions. The data indicate that it will be a substantial challenge to develop inocula for perennial clovers that do not adversely affect nitrogen fixation by sub clover and other annual clovers in commerce, especially if the perennial clovers originate from Africa or America.

To investigate the management of legume-rhizobia interactions when introducing legumes into new environments, a study was initiated in Uruguay (Mediterranean annual clovers were introduced into a predominantly perennial clover setting) that could be considered opposite to the situation emerging within southern Australia (perennial clovers evaluated in a predominantly annual clover setting). The Uruguayan grasslands contain populations of indigenous R. l. trifolii that nodulate endemic T. polymorphum but form ineffective nodules on clovers originating from the Mediterranean region. Importantly in the Uruguayan setting, Government policy has facilitated the introduction of numerous varieties of annual Mediterranean clovers with the aim of improving overall winter production in their naturally managed grasslands. In an attempt to understand the rhizobial ecology of this scenario, a cross-row experiment was set-up in 1999 in a basaltic, acid soil in Glencoe, Uruguay, to follow the survival and symbiotic performance of nine exotic strains of R. l. trifolii. In this thesis I report on the ability of the introduced strains to compete for nodule occupancy of Mediterranean clover hosts and show the impacts of the introduced strains on the productivity of the indigenous Uruguayan clover, T. polymorphum. Of the introduced strains, WSM1325 was a superior inoculant and remained highly persistent and competitive in forming effective symbioses with the Mediterranean hosts, T. purpureum and T. repens, in the Uruguayan environment over a 3 year period. T. purpureum and T. repens, when inoculated with the introduced strains, did not nodulate with any indigenous R. l. trifolii as typed from nodules of T. polymorphum. Conversely, there were no nodules on the Uruguayan host T. polymorphum that contained the introduced R. l. trifolii. These results revealed that there were effective symbioses between strains of R. l. trifolii and clovers, even though the soil contained ineffective R. l. trifolii for all hosts. This represents the first reported example of selective nodulation for an effective symbiosis in situ with annual and perennial clovers in acid soils. This phenomenon raised the question of whether this was restricted to the particular edaphic scenario in Glencoe, Uruguay.

Glasshouse-based experiments in Australia were conducted to further understand the selection phenomenon. Two strains were selected for comparisons; strain WSM1325 isolated from an annual clover in the Mediterranean and WSM2304 isolated from the perennial clover T. polymorphum in Uruguay, South America. Variables that may have been specific to Glencoe were investigated. Thus, the effect of cell density and strain ratio at the time of inoculation, as well as soil pH, were examined on the two hosts (T. purpureum and T. polymorphum). Each was exposed to the same effective and ineffective micro-symbionts. In co-inoculation experiments at a cell density of 104 cells mL-1, each host nodulated solely with its effective strain, even when this strain was out-numbered 100:1 by the ineffective strain. However, the selection process ceased when the effective strain was out-numbered 1000:1. At higher basal cell concentrations of 105 - 108 cells mL-1, selection for WSM1325 to form effective nodules on T. purpureum was evident, but was significantly reduced as the ratio of ineffective cells in the inoculum increased above 4-fold. These results indicate that the selection mechanism is highly dependent upon the basal rhizobial cell density. Soil pH did not significantly alter the process, which could not be simply explained by the rate of strain growth, or extent of nodulation.

Greater precision was sought in the terminology applied to nodulation outcomes where legumes have a choice of micro-symbiotic partners from within the same species of root-nodule bacteria. The nominated preferred terms are &#147;nonselective&#148;, &#147;exclusive&#148;, and &#147;selective&#148; nodulation.

In view of the difference in host range between WSM1325 and WSM2304 and the selective nodulation process, a preliminary investigation into the genetic backgrounds of WSM1325 and WSM2304 was conducted. A selected range of gene regions were amplified by PCR from each strain and sequenced. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences revealed that although the 16S rRNA sequences were identical, the atpD, GSII and nodD sequences contained
distinct differences revealing disparity between the pSym replicons and between the chromosomal replicons of these strains. Of the genes sequenced, the highest degree of divergence was noted for the symbiotic NodD protein products, which are known to be critical determinants in the nodulation of specific hosts. An examination of the nodD gene region of WSM1325 and WSM2304 revealed a further contrasting feature; the regulatory gene nodR was present in the nodD gene region of WSM1325 but absent in WSM2304. Since NodR is known to be required for adding highly unsaturated fatty acyl groups onto the Nod-factor backbone, I could now hypothesise that the nodulation incompatibility observed between Trifolium hosts and micro-symbionts obtained from different geographical locations may result from differences in Nod-factor decoration. With the full genome sequence of the two strains WSM1325 and WSM2304 soon to be available, the role of nodR and any link to the selection phenomenon described in this thesis can be addressed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trifolium; Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii; Nodulation; Competition; Selection</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100330.93305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Righteousness in the Concept of Covenantal Nomism:  An Exegetical Study of the Psalms of Solomon and Paul's Letters</field><field name="creator">30199308@student.murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">Abstract
This thesis is an investigation of E. P. Sanders&#146; concept of Covenantal Nomism as a description of the &#147;pattern of religion&#148; of Judaism.   It has a particular focus on his argument that the religion of first-century Palestinian Judaism was not legalistic.  This thesis seeks to show that his argument is evidently correct by taking the Psalms of Solomon as a case study to test whether its pattern of religion is rightly described as Covenantal Nomism.   It offers a comparative analysis of the Psalms of Solomon and Pauline theology, focusing on the understanding of the &#145;getting in&#146; and &#145;staying in&#146; stages of their soteriologies.  These are analysed using the concepts of &#145;monergism&#146; and &#145;synergism.&#146;

The thesis proceeds to examine their theology of &#228;&#233;&#234;&#225;&#233;&#239;&#243;&#253;&#237;&#231; and &#228;&#233;&#234;&#225;&#233;&#239;&#243;&#253;&#237;&#231; &#232;&#229;&#239;&#245;&#770;; in association with the concept of Covenantal Nomism.  The results of this examination are three main findings, which are as follows.  Firstly, the &#145;getting in&#146; stage of the Psalms of Solomon is monergistic because God&#146;s gracious election alone is involved, while the &#145;getting in&#146; stage of Paul&#146;s soteriology is synergistic because faith in Christ Jesus is needed as a response to God&#146;s justifying activity.  Secondly, in the &#145;staying in&#146; stage, the soteriologies of both the Psalms of Solomon and Paul are synergistic, since obedience to the Law or &#145;obedience of faith&#146; is required to maintain the covenant relationship with God.  Thirdly, both the Psalms of Solomon and Paul&#146;s letters show a similar view, which is that God&#146;s discipline is fundamental to helping the righteous grow in their dependence on Him and rescuing those who sin from destruction.  Both agree that God on the Day of Judgment will reward the righteous who obey, and punish the sinners and the righteous who disobey and choose not to repent.  

The author concludes, from the findings, that contemporary Christians must take care to continue in the obedience of faith and the renewal of their minds through the empowering of the Spirit in order to ensure their continual growth into Christ&#146;s likeness and to avoid punishment on the Day of Judgment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100331.235037</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of the rule of law on the implementation of the convention on the rights of the child in Indonesia and Australia</field><field name="creator">susi_susantijo@uph.edu</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (&#145;the CRC&#146;) in Indonesia: The chasm between theory and practice. Despite the enactment of several laws and regulations aimed at protecting the rights of the child, Indonesia&#146;s implementation of children&#146;s rights remains very limited. The theme of this thesis is that, despite the existence of adequate written laws, a state can fail to achieve an effective implementation of human rights, as exemplified by Indonesia. This thesis will focus on the impact of the rule of law on the holistic well-being of children, a group that Indonesia has acknowledged plays &#145;a strategic role&#146; and is in a &#145;unique position [to ensure] the continued existence of the nation&#146;.

The development of the rule of law and its impact on the implementation of the CRC in Indonesia will be compared to Australia, a state where the CRC has been much better implemented. There is an inextricable link between the rule of law and human rights. The prevailing view is that the rule of law does not depend on written laws; the rule of law is more about the extra-legal aspects of a society, such as culture, socio-economic factors and political factors. In the absence of the rule of law, human rights can only be selectively implemented and enforced.

The rights of the child are a global human rights issue, which is particularly pertinent to Indonesia, a nation with a poor record for implementing children&#146;s rights. Children&#146;s rights are well established in international law, largely due to the adoption of the CRC. The CRC has provided the greatest contribution to the field of children&#146;s rights and will serve as the focus of this thesis. Apart from being the most universally ratified human rights convention in history, the CRC expressly recognises a range of children&#146;s rights including civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights. More importantly, the CRC shifted the responsibility for implementing children&#146;s rights from parents and local communities to State Parties. The CRC is thus an advanced tool for assessing the standard of children&#146;s rights internationally and for implementing change, and will be used to compare the current status of children&#146;s rights in Indonesia and Australia.

Arguably, the issue of children&#146;s rights is complex and the implementation of children&#146;s rights requires a multifaceted approach. This thesis will conclude with recommendations on how Indonesia can move forward to achieve a better implementation of children&#146;s rights.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rule of law</field><field name="subject">rights of the child</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100331.85228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil and Landscape Factors Affecting Phosphorus Loss from the Fitzgerald River Catchment in South West of Western Australia</field><field name="creator">rxysharma76@gmail.com</field><field name="description">Following over 100 years of agriculture and continuous phosphorus (P) fertilizer application in the south west of Western Australia, there is a growing risk of P transport from cropping and pasture land to streams. However, soil and landscape factors affecting the likelihood of P losses and of stream water contamination have not yet been assessed for the South coast region of Western Australia. The present investigation was conducted in the Fitzgerald River catchment located ~ 400 km south east of Perth, to identify risk of P losses from agricultural land to streams, through an understanding of how P is retained within complex landscapes and released via surface and subsurface flow paths. The 104,000 ha catchment is in a moderately dissected landscape (average annual rainfall 450 mm) and discharges into the World Heritage listed Fitzgerald Biosphere. The main use of cleared land in the catchment is broad-scale agriculture, primarily winter grain cropping and pasture for livestock.

The aim of an initial study was to identify the areas with high soil P concentrations and their relationship to factors such as soil type, topography, management (e.g. fertilizer and manure inputs, and uptake by crops or forage) and how variations in soil P concentrations were related to soil physico-chemical properties, P fertilizer management and landscape position. A wide variation in P concentrations was observed across the catchment, but few of the samples exceeded Colwell extractable P levels of 30 mg/kg in the 0-10 cm layer which is regarded as a critical level for crop and pasture productivity. The western area of the catchment, which was cleared earlier (before 1966) than the eastern area had a greater prevalence of loam soils, and higher Colwell-extractable P concentrations (average)22 mg/kg vs. 13 mg P/kg) due to soil type effects and higher P accumulation over time. Risk of P loss from the east and west of the catchment is expected to vary due to textural and topographic differences and P history (P fertilizer input and uptake by crops). The CaCl2-extractable P in the catchment was negatively correlated with oxalate extractable Fe (Feox) in soils. This suggests that P may be transported as particulate P (PP) on loam and clay soils due to sorption of P on oxides surfaces, while on sand soil leaching losses may be more likely. On loam and clay soils, higher sodicity and the dispersive nature of subsoils may increase the risk of both dissolved P (DP) and PP loss due to the effects on hydraulic conductivity of the profile. 

Hedley's fractionation scheme was used to quantify P fractions in the order of decreasing lability, viz: resin-P &gt; NaOH-Pi &gt; NaOH-Po &gt; acid-P (H2SO4-P) &gt; residual-P. Surface soil had higher resin and NaOH-Pi, which are regarded as water-soluble and readily exchangeable P forms, respectively and expected to contribute to DP in the runoff losses. The residual P was the largest fraction followed by the hydroxide extractable organic-P fraction (NaOH-Po): the former was positively correlated (r) with clay content, organic carbon (OC) and pyrophosphate extractable Fe and Al (0.48**, 0.61**, 0.69** and 0.58**, P &lt; 0.01). A relatively higher value of NaOH-Po in the subsurface layer and positive correlation with OC (r = 0.45**, P &lt; 0.01) suggests potential mobility of P as soluble organic P in run-off, throughflow and leachate.

Phosphorus sorption and its relationship to soil properties was used to assess the potential P release from the catchment soils. Values of P sorption maxima varied from 1111-3333 mg/kg for surface soils and 1010-2917 mg/kg for subsoils. The P sorption isotherms conformed better to the Freundlich equation than the Langmuir equation. A highly significant negative correlation between CaCl2 extractable P and Feox in surface soils (r = -0.65**, P &lt; 0.01) suggests that P was bound to hydrated Fe oxide surfaces and this may determine the concentration and dynamics of loosely bound P equilibrating with leachates and eroded particulate materials. On the other hand, high surface organic matter and the high proportion of total dissolved P in organically bound form may inhibit P sorption on clays and sesquioxides, which would increase P mobility through leaching or runoff losses. 

The relationship between soil P concentration and degree of P stratification in the top 0-10 cm of soils along five toposequences was examined to predict the effect on runoff P losses. The total Colwell-P content of the 0-10 cm layer of soils in the catchment was very low in comparison to other studies on P losses from agricultural soils, but soils showed higher P concentration at 0-1 cm depth compared to 5-10 cm (average 37 mg/kg vs. 19 mg/kg). The higher extractable P concentration in the 0-1 cm layer will create a greater P mobilization risk in surface runoff and leachate than analysis of the 0-10 cm layer might suggest. Assessment of P risk using the 0-10 cm data would still be reliable as P concentration in the 0-1 cm layer was linearly related (R2 = 0.59) with concentration in the 0-10 cm layer. The sampling at varied soil depths will result in different critical P levels for estimating the risk of P enrichment in runoff.

In a glasshouse study with intact soil columns, initial high P concentrations in leachate decreased with leaching events suggesting that macropore flow dominated in initial leaching events changing later to matrix flow. The hydraulic behavior of clay and loam soil below 10 cm depends largely on structure and the type of clay minerals and exchangeable Na. Higher levels of exchangeable Na in the subsoil might increase dispersion of clay particles resulting in low permeability leading to ponding of surface water or lateral movement of water at the interface of sand A and clay B horizons. Lateral water movements increase the risk of P losses in the form of DP, dissolved organic P (DOP) or PP. The P concentration in all the P forms (DRP, DOP and TDP) increased significantly with P rates of application (P &lt; 0.01). The DRP concentration was &lt; 2 mg/l in unfertilized columns but an increase to 11 mg/l was observed with P application at 40 kg P/ha. The higher proportion of DOP relative to DRP and its correlation with TDP indicates that the DOP was the major form of P in leachate. However, the estimation of DOP which was by subtraction of DRP from TDP generally overestimates OP concentration. 

The TDP load from unfertilized soil was &lt; 0.20 mg/l in runoff and &lt; 2.40 mg/l in throughflow but increased with P application (20, 40 kg P/ha) for both packed box and field studies. Under field conditions, higher P loss was found with broadcast P application compared to drill placement. The higher load of DOP as a proportion of TDP and its significant relationship with TDP in runoff (R2sand = 0.81; R2clay = 0.79) and throughflow (R2sand = 0.94; R2clay = 0.98) in field and box studies also suggests DOP was the major form of P loss from soil. Dissolved OP concentration increased significantly with increase in soluble organic carbon (SOC) in soil solution at 5 cm depth (P &lt; 0.05). Consequently, the amount of organic matter dissolved in soil solution may influence P sorption and mobility. Relatively higher affinity of soil for sorption of DRP compared to DOP might allow DOP to be more mobile through the profile. Higher PP load in clay soil in throughflow indicates subsurface lateral flow along the interface with the horizon of dispersive clay might be an additional risk factor regarding P mobility in clay soils of the catchment.

The runoff, throughflow and leachate were dominated by eroded particles of clay and colloidal organic materials. However, the soil solution collected though 0.1 &#61549;m pores in the Rhizon samplers had a similar dominance of DOP to the &lt; 0.45 jum filtered samples in runoff and throughflow. This reduces the likelihood that the so-called DOP fraction was mostly P associated with PP in the 0.1 to 0.45 jum size fraction. The composition of DOP in soil solution collected through Rhizon samplers (&lt; 0.1 jum) might provide important insights for P mobility since this more effectively excluded PP than in the &lt; 0.45 jum filtrate used for runoff and throughflow samples. The DOP in soil solution (&lt; 0.1 jum) might be associated with fine colloidal compound such as silicates, metallic hydroxides, humic acids, polysaccharides, fulvic acids and proteins. If so, then most, but not all of the DOP fraction would be organically bound. However, this requires verification.

In conclusion, soil P levels across the catchment were never very high when assessed in the 0-10 cm layer, but levels in the 0-1 cm layer were more than twice as high. Overall, &lt; 1 % of land area of the upper Fitzgerald River catchment had Colwell-P levels &gt; 30 mg/kg (0-10 cm) and hydrological connection to streams. In addition, another 7 % of land had Colwell-P levels &gt; 15 mg/kg, which appears to be a change point in soils for the release of CaCl2 extractable P. These areas, which are predicted to represent critical source areas of the catchment, need careful management. The high proportions of TDP as DOP in runoff, throughflow and soil solution suggest DOP was the major form of P loss from soil. Phosphorus losses from the catchments are also likely in the form of PP in clay and loam soil but leaching losses are more likely in sand. High exchangeable Na in the subsoil of loam and clay soils increases dispersion of clay particles resulting in low permeability of subsoil and greater lateral P mobility as throughflow at the interface of sand and clay textured horizons. 

In general, soils of Fitzgerald River catchment had low soil P, but nevertheless significant risk of P loss at Colwell-P &gt; 15 mg/kg. This study provides baseline information for P loss risks in the wheatbelt of WA. Stream water quality monitoring instruments were installed in the upper Fitzgerald River Catchment at 5 stream locations by CSIRO to measure base line concentrations of P. The measured P concentrations were higher than ANZECC trigger values (&gt; 0.05 mg P/l) for management response over the three-year monitoring period (2005-07). Hence this and many other catchments on the south coast and wheatbelt of south west Western Australia need assessment for P loss risks. Previous emphasis in south west Western Australia on P losses from sandy coastal soils under pasture may need to be reconsidered. In the South coast region, cropping land in the medium rainfall zone may still represent a risk of P loss to waterways and risk to water quality. The present study evaluated the risk of P loss based on soil P forms and their mobility. It suggests greater attention needs to be given to the difference between clay and loam soils with dispersive or non-dispersive sub-soils, and to the composition and mobility of DOP. However, a more complete understanding of P loss risks depends on follow-up studies on hydrological flow and connectivity in the upper Fitzgerald River catchment and similar landscapes of south west Western Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Critical Source Areas (CSA)</field><field name="subject">hydrological risks</field><field name="subject">leaching</field><field name="subject">P fractionation P risk losses</field><field name="subject">runoff</field><field name="subject">stratification</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100331.90105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Realms: A Phenomenological, Socio-Cultural and Theological-Religious Studies exploration of Musical Space</field><field name="creator">m.jennings@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">This thesis sets out to explore the ways people use and interpret experience of music, the divine and interaction with other people within discrete musical spaces. This exploration takes place in two sites: a Pentecostal church in suburban Perth, Western Australia, and the West Coast Blues &amp; Roots festival, a well known music festival held annually in Fremantle, Western Australia. I have nominated these two sites as &#147;realms&#148; because they are spaces set up for the performance and experience of music. 

My primary questions about these sites relate to how people interact with music, each other and the divine within these realms. This study combines socio-cultural and theological-religious studies theories to illuminate the processes, experiences and interpretations occurring within these musical realms. This has important implications for understanding how people use and interpret music in relation to the world outside the musical realm. People use these experiences to dream and imagine the shape of ideal relationships and communities with each other and the divine presence, and to escape and transform the world outside the musical realm. 

In this thesis I compile data from participant observation and in-depth interviews at both sites, as well as published interviews with performers. I construct two case studies of the sites, portraying a &#147;day in the life&#148; of a participant in both realms. For each case study I outline ten different interpretive paradigms, five from socio-cultural theorists and five from theology and religious studies. I analyse the data using the phenomenological method, taking a component of data from the fieldwork and comparing and contrasting it with theory. At the end of each chapter I summarise the process and make some remarks relating to the implications of the study. 

The resulting work makes important contributions to understanding how socio-cultural studies and theological-religious studies can work together in an interdisciplinary fashion to illuminate phenomena. The study sheds light on the nature of musical &#147;realms&#148;, as well as &#147;proto-religious phenomena&#148; and &#147;methodological agnosticism&#148;. Further, this work presents useful contributions into the ways churches may understand and interact with spiritual experience that occurs outside of religious settings. Finally, performers and artists and community workers will benefit from the conclusions of this study on the ways in which people use music and realms to escape, transform and imagine community and society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Popular culture</field><field name="subject">Pentecostalism</field><field name="subject">Space</field><field name="subject">Religious Experience</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100421.135501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and disease status of Australia's most critically endangered mammal the Gilbert's potoroo(Potorous gilbertii)</field><field name="creator">rebecca.vaughan@ioz.ac.uk</field><field name="description">The Gilbert&#146;s potoroo (Potorous gilbertii) is a small marsupial endemic to the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve in the south-west of Western Australia.  The Gilbert&#146;s potoroo is classified as Australia&#146;s most critically endangered mammal (IUCN 2006) with an estimated population of only 35 individuals.  This thesis examines the health and disease status of the Gilbert&#146;s potoroo, presenting a strong case for the relatively new concept of disease as a potential threatening factor and modifier of population decline.  

Specific diseases, including Cryptococcus, ectoparasitism, endoparasitism, haemoparasitism, Toxoplasma and a novel Treponema organism are extensively studied.  An assessment of the clinical significance of these diseases is made, and management strategies are recommended to minimise the impact of these diseases on both the wild and captive population.

The novel Treponema organism which clinically presents with tenacious, green discharge and an associated balanoposthitis in males is molecularly characterized.  Epidemiological studies show the effects of this agent on reproductive function and a penicillin-based treatment regime is trialled in the analogous long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) with a recommendation to then trial this treatment regime in the critically endangered Gilbert&#146;s potoroo.

Standard haematological and urinalysis findings are tabulated to form reference ranges for this species.  A treatment regime for Cryptococcus in the analogous long-nosed potoroo is reported and parasitological findings, including the identification of a novel tick species are discussed.

This thesis addresses key health issues, which have subsequently been incorporated into the Recovery Plan of the Gilbert&#146;s potoroo. A document encompassing multiple disciplines and expertise to support the recovery of this critically endangered marsupial in its current environment.  In addition, this thesis outlines a recommended health monitoring and treatment protocol for future translocation procedures and provides a working example of the emerging importance of health monitoring in threatened species recovery programs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gilberts potoroo</field><field name="subject">Marsupial</field><field name="subject">Treponema</field><field name="subject">Disease</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100423.124817</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A longitudinal study of beginning teachers' pedagogical identity and their use of ICT</field><field name="creator">frank_bate@optusnet.com.au</field><field name="description">The educational policy environment in Australia explicitly supports the integration of information and communications technologies (ICT) through targeted initiatives covering infrastructure, equipment, electronic learning materials and professional development. However, for all the energy expended to encourage teachers to use ICT, it is reported that few teachers take full advantage of the significant opportunities that ICT present. A number of reasons have been cited to explain this, the most compelling of which are bound up with teachers&#146; knowledge and skills in harnessing ICT and their beliefs about ICT and teaching itself. 

This research presents a three year longitudinal study of a cohort of 35 beginning teachers located in Western Australia. The focus on beginning teachers is purposeful. It is suggested that this segment of the teaching profession can provide useful insights into the affordances and risks that teachers face in harnessing ICT. Beginning teachers may also provide a window into how ICT will be taken up in the future. The aim of the research, therefore, is to describe and explain beginning teachers&#146; beliefs, knowledge, dispositions and skills in using ICT within the context of their school environment(s). 

The research literature characterises beginning teachers as having positive self-perceptions of their ability to use ICT, and embracing contemporary, student-centred theories of learning. Given these preconditions, it might seem likely that beginning teachers would seek to integrate ICT into their teaching in innovative ways. The seven research questions that underpin and guide the research are aimed, at least in part, at confirming or challenging this assertion. 

The study adopts a mixed method approach in seeking to understand and interpret the dynamic nature of participants&#146; beliefs about teaching and their knowledge, dispositions and skills in using ICT within their socio-cultural context. A rich data set, gathered over three years and using qualitative and quantitative techniques, is presented to provide evidence in relation to the study&#146;s research questions. The longitudinal nature of the study provides opportunities to interpret this data set over time, adding to the strength and credibility of the research.

Participants articulated pedagogical beliefs that aimed to engage students in active meaning making. However, the way in which participants used ICT was generally limited to presentation-style teaching, completion of worksheets using a narrow range of productivity software and the use of the World Wide Web for simple inquiries or reinforcement. There was a clear mismatch between the ideals that participants claimed to hold to be important and their capacity to use ICT to help realise these ideals. Four interrelated factors are posited to explain this: lack of clarity over beliefs and how ICT can support these beliefs; variability of perceptions within schools of the affordances and risks of using ICT; embedded structural constraints that stall the creative use of ICT; and, deficiencies in technological-pedagogical-content knowledge. 

The study may interest educational policy-makers, school leaders, managers, teachers and other learning professionals that are considering how to conceptualise, plan, implement and/or enhance the use of ICT within their local context. A model is presented to help educators grapple with the implications of using ICT in the classroom and explore its transformative potential.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ICT</field><field name="subject">ICT integration</field><field name="subject">ICT transformation</field><field name="subject">information and communications technologies</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100427.222635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#147;Don&#146;t give up on them&#148;: Managing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Schools - What teachers and parents believe and know</field><field name="creator">emmanuella.murray@bigpond.com</field><field name="description">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most prevalent childhood and adolescent behavioural disorders affecting children worldwide. This research investigated teachers&#146; and parents&#146; knowledge of, attitudes and behaviours toward children with ADHD. Findings from this investigation then informed the development and evaluation of a pilot ADHD intervention program for pre-service teachers designed to enhance their own knowledge and skills, and to frame intervention as a shared endeavour between parents, teachers and the broader school community. 

Study One provided local confirmation of the broadly reported needs of teachers, pre-service teachers and parents for improved knowledge and change in attitudes toward children with ADHD. Both pre-service and in-service teachers held comparable views, though the former generally reported being less confident in their skills and abilities to manage these children. A small sample of parents of children with ADHD provided rich insight into their parenting experiences and the challenges faced in the school environment.  Uniquely this study also included parents without a child with ADHD, in recognition of their importance in influencing the broader school environment for children with ADHD. Consistent with previous research, parents were somewhat informed about the characteristics of ADHD but less so about treatment. Descriptive comparisons between parents and teachers suggested that there were some similarities and some differences in what was known and what myths were held by the two groups.    

Study Two is in two parts. Part one of the study further investigated pre-service teachers&#146; knowledge of and attitudes toward children with ADHD. Seventy-seven pre-service teachers were surveyed whilst completing their third or final year of an Education degree at a university in Western Australia. There was a moderate correlation between a perceived competence factor on an Attitude Scale and scores on a Knowledge Scale. There was no greater knowledge amongst those reporting previous ADHD training at university, but there was a trend toward more unfavourable attitudes amongst respondents reporting no prior training. Descriptive analyses also showed a strong desire by pre-service teachers to engage in further ADHD training, irrespective of whether they had previous exposure to training or not.  

This evidence base was then used in part two of Study Two to develop and evaluate a pilot intervention for pre-service teachers to improve knowledge, attitudes and self-confidence in teachers in responding to ADHD. Forty-five attended the intervention program. Of these, twenty-eight participants completed identical measures at pre, post and follow-up time points. Pre-service teachers showed a significant improvement in their knowledge scores and perceived knowledge and skills after the workshop.  

Taken together, these studies suggest that while teachers have some knowledge about ADHD, there is a need for further training in order to better equip them for managing children with this condition in the classroom. Furthermore, parents with a child with ADHD desire further education about the disorder and those who do not have a child with ADHD are also likely to benefit also from education about the disorder and its corollaries in the school environment. Differences in understanding of ADHD between the groups emphasise the importance of developing a collaborative stance between teachers and parents in the school community. Finally, the pre-service pilot program was found to be an enabler for teachers to understand and work more effectively with children with the disorder. Methodological limitations and directions for future research for each study are discussed.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100506.191255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Be(com)ing Reel Independent Woman: An Autoethnographic Journey Through Female Subjectivity and Agency in Contemporary Cinema with Particular Reference to Independent Scriptwriting Practice</field><field name="creator">larissa.sextonfinck@uwa.edu.au</field><field name="description">Women exert only a modicum of production power in 21st century cinema despite its growing accessibility and spectatorship through the developing technologies of the digital era. In 2007, of the top 250 grossing films in Hollywood, only 10% were written, and 6% directed, by women, and just 16% contained leading female protagonists. Why, after the gains of the film feminist movement, is there such a significant gender imbalance in mainstream film, and an imbalance that is only increasing over time? More significantly, what are the possibilities and limitations for reel woman&#146;s subjectivity and agency, in and on screen, in this male-dominated landscape?

As a female filmmaker in this current climate I conduct an autoethnographical scriptwriting-based investigation into female subjectivity and agency, by writing the feature length screenplay Float, which is both the dramatic experiment and the creative outcome of this research. The exegesis works symbiotically with my scriptwriting journey by outlining the broader contexts surrounding women filmmakers and their female representations.

In this self-reflexive examination, I use an interdisciplinary methodology to unravel the overt and latent sites of resistance for reel woman today on three interdependent levels. These comprise the historical, political and philosophical background to woman&#146;s treatment both behind, and in front of, the camera; my lived experiences as an emerging writer/director as I write Float; and my representation of the screenplay&#146;s central female character.

I use the multiple logic of screenplay diegesis to explore the issues that have a bearing on women&#146;s ability to be active agents in the world they inhabit, including: the dichotomising of female desire, the influence of familial history, the repression of the mother, the dominance of the male gaze, the disavowal of female specificity, and women&#146;s consequent dislocation from their self-determined desire. These obstacles are simultaneously negotiated as I map my process of writing Float and deal with the challenging contexts in which the screenplay was created. In the course of my scriptwriting investigation, film feminist and French poststructuralist paradigms are considered and negotiated as I experiment whether it is possible for female filmmakers, and their female characters, to overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds facing women&#146;s actualisation today.

My research brings to light the critical need for more inclusive modes of practice across the film industry, discourse and pedagogy that are cognisant and respectful of reel women&#146;s difference, and allow them to explore their own specificity. The thesis argues that it would be advantageous for female filmmakers to challenge their &#145;fixed&#146; status in phallocentric discourse, and to deconstruct their patriarchal conditioning through engagement with forms of identity and writing resistance that recognise the fluidity of their subjectivity, and the consequent potential for change. I also highlight the importance of an accessible and affirmative feminist cinema pertinent to the 21st century, to integrate feminist ideals into the mainstream, and finally bring reel woman out of the margins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gendered film</field><field name="subject">female filmmaking</field><field name="subject">australian films</field><field name="subject">film pedagogy</field><field name="subject">creative analytic practice</field><field name="subject">hollywood</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100512.122302</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating a Practical Legal Framework for the Commercial Exploitation of Mineral Resources in Outer Space</field><field name="creator">rjlee@rickylee.com.au</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the legal and policy issues relating to what may be the most exciting prospect in the history of the human civilisation: the commercial exploitation of natural resources in outer space. The thesis is based on the hypothesis that such ventures are inhibited not by physical, technological and economic factors, but by the inadequacies and uncertainties present in the current body of space law and policy. Consequently, a new international legal framework and a policy consensus are required to provide a legal environment favourable for such a valuable and necessary development.

To substantiate this hypothesis, the thesis begins by establishing the economic necessity and technical feasibility of space mining today, an estimate of the financial commitments required. This is followed by a risk analysis of a typical commercial mining venture in space, identifying the economic and legal risks. This leads to the recognition that the legal risks must be minimised to enable such enormous financial commitments to be made.

What then follows is a detailed analysis of the legal framework for such activities as well as identifying the inadequacies of space law for the commercial exploitation of celestial resources. This is achieved through a discussion of the general principles of international space law, particularly dealing with state responsibility and international liability, as well as some of the issues arising from space mining activities. Much detail is devoted to the analysis of the content of the &#147;common heritage of mankind&#148; doctrine in international law and the effect of international disagreement over its application to celestial bodies.

Having established the relevant legal issues, the thesis then turns to consider the past failures in reach similar agreements and the competing policy interests that have prevented the success of such agreements. It attempts to balance such interests in creating a legal and policy compromise that may be acceptable to a majority of the international community and provide some practical proposals on the structural, procedural, administrative and judicial aspects of creating and implementing a new legal framework.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">space law</field><field name="subject">resource economics</field><field name="subject">international law</field><field name="subject">outer space</field><field name="subject">mining</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100512.84701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of free-living nematodes in nearshore marine and estuarine sediments of the microtidal lower west coast of Australia.</field><field name="creator">m.hourston@iinet.net.au</field><field name="description">The overarching aim of this thesis was to describe the ecology of the assemblages of free-living nematodes in the sediments of nearshore marine and estuarine waters on the microtidal lower west coast of Australia. The thesis also provides descriptions of ten previously undescribed species as well as develops and tests a habitat classification scheme for the Swan River Estuary using these biotic assemblages.

The first section of my thesis has determined the ways in which the characteristics of the nematode assemblages in nearshore marine waters along the microtidal lower west coast of Australia are related to habitat type, time of year and shore-perpendicular zones. Three habitat types, which had previously been identified on the basis of a suite of enduring environmental characteristics, could be broadly described as highly sheltered from wave activity and containing dense seagrass (habitat type 1), moderately sheltered from wave activity and with sparse seagrass (habitat type 2) and relatively exposed to wave activity and with no seagrass (habitat type 6). Sampling in five consecutive seasons yielded &gt; 15 000 nematodes, representing 75 species. The number of species and densities in habitat type 1, and particularly those in its subtidal zone, were far greater than those in the other two habitat types. Both of these biotic variables underwent marked seasonal changes, declining to low levels during winter. The compositions of the assemblages differed significantly among the three habitat types, with the differences between habitat types 1 and 6 being particularly marked. Paracomesoma sipho, Dichromadora sp., Marylynnia annae and Pomponema sp., which, on the basis of their buccal cavity morphology, are assumed to feed primarily on benthic diatoms, were particularly abundant at the most sheltered habitat type, whereas Gonionchus australis, Theristus sp. and Bathylaimus australis, which are assumed to be deposit feeders, were relatively abundant at the most highly exposed habitat type. The compositions of the assemblages differed among seasons and were most discrete in spring, due to marked increases in the densities of certain species. However, differences in the compositions in the different zones of each habitat type were relatively small, presumably reflecting the influence of the small tidal regime of this region.

The second component of this thesis has determined the ways in which the density, number of species, species composition and trophic structure of free-living nematode assemblages in the subtidal waters of a large microtidal estuary change spatially and temporally, and has explored whether those four biotic characteristics are related to certain environmental factors. Based on data derived from samples collected seasonally at 12 sites throughout the estuary, the densities and number of species of nematodes decreased progressively with distance from estuary mouth, to reach a minimum at sites where salinities were most variable, and then increased slightly in the uppermost part of the estuary where salinities were least. Densities were also generally greatest in spring, due largely to increases in the abundance of epistrate-grazing species at the time when the amount of primary food (microphytobenthos) peaked. The spatial distribution of the composition of the nematode assemblages was closely correlated with salinity and, to a lesser extent, grain-size composition and amount of particulate organic material in the sediment (%POM). Although species composition changed sequentially along the estuary, the change was particularly pronounced between sites above and below the area where salinities started to decline markedly and become more variable and %POM increased markedly. This reflected, in particular, far greater abundances of Spirinia parasitifera at the six downstream sites, and of Theristus sp. 1 at the six sites further upstream. Species composition underwent pronounced seasonal cyclical changes at all sites, presumably reflecting interspecific differences in the timing of peak reproduction and thus of recruitment. The trophic structure of the nematode assemblages changed both spatially and temporally in relation to the relative abundance of different food sources. Thus, for example, non-selective deposit feeders, such as Theristus sp. 1, dominated samples in the upper estuary, where %POM was by far the greatest, and was rare or absent at downstream sites. Conversely, epistrate grazers, such as species of the Chromadoridae, were most abundant at downstream sites in spring, when the density of the microphytobenthos reached its maximum.

The data for the nematode assemblages in nearshore subtidal marine sediments of the lower west coast of Australia were compared with those in nearshore subtidal sediments in the upper and lower regions of the Swan River Estuary. The densities and average species richness in cores from the marine environment were much lower than in cores from both estuarine regions. However, the total number of species found in the marine environment was much greater than in the estuary. The compositions of the nematode assemblages were more variable in marine than estuarine sediments. The assemblages from the two estuarine regions were far more similar to each other than to those from the marine region at a species level, and also, but to a lesser extent, at the generic and family levels.

While the trophic compositions of the nematode assemblages in the upper estuarine region was dominated by non-selective deposit feeding species and those of the lower estuarine region were dominated by epistrate grazing species during spring and non-selective deposit feeding species in other seasons, the dominant functional feeding groups varied among the sites representing the marine region. That variability presumably reflects differences in the relative contributions of the different potential food sources. Surprisingly, the trophic composition in the upper estuarine region, i.e. comprising predominantly non-selective deposit feeders, was similar to that at the very different environment of the most exposed marine site. The dominance of this feeding group at the marine site is assumed to be attributable to the fact that the only food source of any note is POM and, even then, it occurs in only small amounts. Taxonomic descriptions have been produced for ten new species of nematodes found during the ecological studies of the free-living aquatic nematofaunas of south-western Australia. These species were chosen because they were members of families for which the other species had been described and, in a number of cases, were important for distinguishing between the compositions of a priori groups. They comprised four species of Axonolaimidae, representing the genera Ascolaimus, Parascolaimus, Odontophora and Parodontophora, and six species of Desmodoridae, representing single species of Bolbonema, Eubostrichus, Catanema and Leptonemella and two species of Onyx.

As a complement to the nematological study of the Swan River Estuary, a novel habitat classification system was developed and then applied in this environment. This system was based on enduring environmental characteristics and employed the relatively new multivariate statistical routines SIMPROF and LINKTREE. The applicability of habitat types produced by this classification system to biotic assemblages was tested using the data for the estuarine nematode assemblages described above. The results demonstrate that the compositions of the assemblages differed significantly among each of the habitat types defined by the classification system. While there were also significant differences between the compositions of the nematofaunas at sites belonging to the same habitat type, the extent of these differences were generally less than those between habitat types. A significant and strong correlation was also found between the spatial pattern exhibited by the environmental characteristics used to define habitat types, and that of the nematofauna.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Free-living</field><field name="subject">Swan estuary</field><field name="subject">Nematodes</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100512.85739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Health and 'I': An analysis of curricular phenomena in health professional education through the focus of critical pedagogy</field><field name="creator">wendyduggie@btinternet.com</field><field name="description">The education of health professionals is based on a series of discourses of professionalism that privilege notions of control and choice (Riggs, 2004a; Titchen and Higgs, 2001). These discourses are expressed through both explicit and implicit curricula, which encourage the enactment of a particular construction of the 'self' of both health professionals and clients or patients. This thesis adopts a feminist poststructural analysis of relations of power to explore some of the effects of the enactment of these curricula, drawing on three case studies of education in rural health settings and interviews with 17 health workers.

The results indicate that the enactment of these curricula seems to produce a particular sense of self for health workers &#150; one that is bound up with notions of control and choice, and one that may require struggle on an inner level with the self-regulation and self-policing (O'Grady, 2005) required to fit this norm. The struggle for female health workers to link the abstract theorizing with the actualities of their lives (Williams, 2002) seems to produce a paradoxical type of relationship with themselves and their clients. On one hand there is a discourse of conformity, compliance and obedience, which suggests more of a slippage of self while at the same time the expert-novice relationship characterizing the health professionals&#8223; interaction with clients emphasizes autonomy, control and empowerment of self. Further, while health workers see themselves as having high levels of internal locus of control this is in direct contrast to the helplessness and powerlessness they experience at work, and revealed through the research.

The curriculum reform taking place within all health professional education at the moment emphasizes evidence-based practice and scientific content, and thus reinforces the dominant norm of the neo-liberal individual capable of self-regulation and self-policing. This research suggests the limitations of this approach, given the practices of power that continue to disadvantage women in general and patients in particular in relation to their health and the institution.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health professional curricula</field><field name="subject">critical pedagogy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">choice</field><field name="subject">feminist poststructural analysis</field><field name="subject">subjectivity</field><field name="subject">embodiment</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100513.114004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whitefellas and Wadjulas: Anti-colonial Constructions of the non-Aboriginal Self</field><field name="creator">M.Carey@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I argue for anti-colonial constructions of the non-Aboriginal self.  I take as my starting point that members of the invader/settler society in Australia must place them/ourselves in &#147;an embodied awareness of &#145;being in Indigenous sovereignty&#146;&#148; (Nicholl, 2004: 17) and name them/ourselves accordingly.  An anti-colonial construction of non-Aboriginality formed within the locus of Aboriginal Sovereignty undermines the potency of &#145;post-colonial&#146; processes of identity formation, which privilege the colonialist centre, and the concomitant marginalised position of Indigenous people.  Thus, an anti-colonial construction of non-Aboriginality constitutes a radical recentring for processes of identity construction within invader/settler societies.

This work responds to critical whiteness studies and post-colonial discourses of &#145;belonging&#146;. I acknowledge both whiteness studies and work on invader/settler belongings have gained traction in recent years as a means to problematise the whiteness of the settler/invader group and the legitimacy of their/our belongings.   However, I argue they continue to operate within colonialist paradigms and perpetuate (neo)colonial power relations.  

In this thesis, I argue anti-colonial constructions of non-Aboriginality are constructed in dialogue with Aboriginal people. I conceive non-Aboriginality as a political identity that rejects &#145;race&#146; and &#145;colour&#146; as markers for identity.  &#145;Non-Aboriginality&#146; enables members of invader/settler societies to articulate support for Aboriginal Sovereignty and Aboriginal claims for social justice and human rights.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anti-colonial</field><field name="subject">whiteness</field><field name="subject">belonging</field><field name="subject">new race abolitionists</field><field name="subject">non-Aboriginal identity</field><field name="subject">Indigenous sovereignty</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100514.132152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining the Impact of E-privacy Risk Concerns on Citizens' Intentions to use E-government Services: An Oman Perspective</field><field name="creator">d.alabri@murdoch.edu.au</field><field name="description">E-privacy concerns are among the online transactions risks that influence the use of e-services and e-government services. Whilst there have been studies that have analysed the impact of e-privacy on the willingness of people to utilize the Internet, especially in e-commerce, there has been limited research in relation to e-government services for a specific demographic group. This study has examined the impact of e-privacy risk concerns on the acceptance of e-government services in Oman using an integrated model. The model is based on Liu et al.&#8223;s (2005) privacy-trust-behavioral intention model, the broader technology acceptance literature, and recent work on e-privacy awareness and protection. The research used both quantitative and qualitative approaches: data collection by questionnaire and a series of semi-structured interviews. The sampling frame for the study was civil services government employees in Oman. The model was tested using partial least squares and the results were compared to those obtained from the interview data.

The study found that e-privacy awareness significantly impacts the level of e-privacy risk concerns. Social norms and perceived usefulness were found to play a significant role in influencing the intention to use e-government services. The study also found that e-privacy concerns and perceptions of the protection available against risks influence citizens&#8223; intentions to use e-government services via their influence on the perceived trustworthiness of these services. Thus trustworthiness is a factor that could be an obstacle to successful e-government services project implementation. Therefore the thesis recommends that governments pay greater attention to the role of e-privacy concerns and put in place security and e-privacy controls. Citizens should then be made aware of these in order to build the required level of trust and confidence in these services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">E-privacy Risk Concerns</field><field name="subject">Trustworthiness of E-government Services</field><field name="subject">E privacy Protection</field><field name="subject">Oman</field><field name="subject">E-privacy Awareness</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100517.160559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The eyes of death: The visual movement from witness to spectator</field><field name="creator">zdag@yahoo.com</field><field name="description">This doctoral study, composed of four films and an exegesis, configures a new conceptualisation of death in and through film, assembling an intricate theorisation of &#145;the mediated I&#146; and &#145;the unmediated I&#146; of the witness. This thesis focuses on the consciousness of the witness, through locating a position and expression in reflective, reflexive, experiential, critical and artistic practice. My research questions the witness&#146;s attempt to &#145;manage&#146; the experience and tracks the self reflective process of thought s/he undertakes in the face of death, dying, coma and suffering. In probing the subjective experiences of the witness, the knowledge of disaster and the absent Other gives way to a moment of distinction between the spectator and the witness. The actual movement being proposed between the two is through the ways in which they both are activated through the reality of death. Critical and creative practice encourages a recognition of - and identification with - the possible meditations and negotiations of the witness. It aims to infuse a configuration of the witness by way of reflection in consciousness and artistic formulation.

This thesis proposes a conceptual diagnosis as the original contribution to knowledge. I identify apathy as an anti-choice and unrecognised necessity of consciousness in the face of death, dying, coma and suffering. The research offers a new insight into the existential encounter of the witness. The aim of the practice component is to re-present and re-vision everyday encounters on television and in media alongside metaphors, possible meditations and negotiations to the subjective experience in and through filmic gaze. The visual propositions complement the written text by means of displaying the fear and anguish of the witness, and the attitude towards the Other, disaster and the irrecoverable death. The aim in turning this subject matter into an academic study has been to align two different perceptions: visual and theoretical practice. These two conceptual terms have offered distinct ways of handling the unsettling encounter from not only a witness&#146;s point of view but also from the perspective of a researcher and the film-maker.

Together, the visual and theoretical strategy reveal the workings of consciousness and creative meditation of the witness to identify the struggles against internal and external terror in being a witness. The research is interdisciplinary, deploying philosophy, literary and artistic theory. Yet it is not a contribution to the specialised discipline of philosophy, sociology or psychoanalysis of death, dying and suffering, but offers a critical and creative matrix combining inventive and reflexive approaches. This practice-based doctoral study challenges the artist and practitioner to create and then raise awareness through a dynamic, reflexive and interpretative discourse. It fuses genres, including autobiography, literary studies and visual arts.

The relationship between the exegesis and films provide an innovative pathway through creative meditation and negotiation of the witness by integrating filmic presentations as an integral loop in the research. Every chapter frames a dialogue between already existing theories of death, dying and grief and filmic texts to transform experience into visuality through constructing a descriptive insight and artistic expression.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">dying</field><field name="subject">suffering</field><field name="subject">witness</field><field name="subject">spectator</field><field name="subject">anguish</field><field name="subject">images of death</field><field name="subject">apathy</field><field name="subject">disaster</field><field name="subject">the other</field><field name="subject">mourning</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20100518.111353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Haemogregarine Blood Parasites In Triggerfish And Surgeonfish: Distribution, Transmission &amp; Implications For Their Host Fish</field><field name="creator">Lynda Curtis</field><field name="description">Haemogregarines are apicomplexan, protozoan parasites that have been documented in the blood of many vertebrate hosts including birds, snakes, lizards, frogs and fishes. Previous reports have focussed on haemogregarine morphology, hosts and locality with relatively little information pertaining to parasite transmission and consequences of infection for the host. While there have been some surveys and a few reports of haemogregarines in coral reef fishes, studies examining likely vectors in a coral reef system and the effect of haemogregarines on their coral reef fish hosts are lacking. Therefore using several triggerfish and surgeonfish species as model hosts for haemogregarines, surveys and experiments on triggerfishes and surgeonfishes inhabiting coral reefs in Indonesia, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), South East Queensland and French Polynesia were conducted and the relationship between haemogregarines and their hosts was examined. Initially the distribution of haemogregarines in triggerfishes across several locations in the Indo-Pacific was determined by examining fish blood films. Many species of triggerfish were infected with Haemogregarina balistapi. Within the model host group, the flag-tailed triggerfish, Sufflamen chrysopterum, H. balistapi infection intensity and prevalence varied among these locations. When H. balistapi was quantified in a population of S. chrysopterum at Lizard Island on the GBR, differences were not found in parasite intensity and prevalence over the 17 month sampling period. Possibly, the spatial variation in infection intensity is related to variation in water temperature or vector abundance among locations. The intensity of H. balistapi infections in the blackbar triggerfish, Rhinecanthus aculeatus and S. chrysopterum at Lizard Island did not vary with the standard length (SL) of the host fish. However, the prevalence of H. balistapi infections did vary as the SL of non-parasitised S. chrysopterum and R. aculeatus at Lizard Island was significantly higher than parasitised fish. Larger non-parasitised fish might have been expected if H. balistapi were detrimental to their hosts and affected their growth, or if the fish becomes resistant to the infection with increasing age. Although the vectors of haemogregarines among coral reef fish are unknown, previous studies in rocky reef systems in Europe and South Africa suggest that juvenile ectoparasitic stages of gnathiid isopods could be potential vectors. Therefore, whether gnathiid isopods are the definitive hosts of H. balistapi at Lizard Island on the GBR was examined. While blood-sucking, juvenile gnathiids were found on many fishes, no other possible vector, such as a leech, was detected on fish. Furthermore, when the triggerfish R. aculeatus was kept in a gnathiid-free environment in the laboratory, the intensityof their H. balistapi infections decreased when compared with tagged fish in the wild. This supported the idea that gnathiids are potential vectors of H. balistapi and that the host fish may need continued contact with the vector for infections to persist in the vertebrate host population. Whether the life cycle of H. balistapi could be completed in a gnathiid was then examined. Cultured juveniles of Gnathia aureamaculosa were fed on the blood of the triggerfish R. aculeatus infected with H. balistapi and squashes of gnathiids and blood smears from the fish were prepared over the following days. Gnathiid squashes contained mature haemogregarine gamonts, like those seen in the fish blood smears, as well as haemogregarine developmental stages including oocysts, sporozoites, meronts and merozoites. This provided very strong evidence that G. aureamaculosa is a definitive host for H. balistapi and that this, and possibly other gnathiids, have the potential to act as vectors of this haemogregarine. Despite increasing evidence that gnathiids may act as vectors of haemogregarines, until this study, biological transmission experiments in a coral reef system had not been conducted. Therefore, for the first time, this study tested whether G. aureamaculosa transmitted H. balistapi and a second fish haemogregarine Haemogregarina bigemina to recipient triggerfish S. chrysopterum and the yellowfin surgeonfish, Acanthurus xanthopterus. Two possible modes of transmission to the clean fish under test were investigated: 1) by ingestion of gnathiids (recipient fish=32) and 2) by bite through gnathiid feeding activity (recipient fish=3). Recipient fish S. chrysopterum and A. xanthopterus were reared from larvae and did not have any detectable haemogregarines before exposure to gnathiids. Uninfected gnathiids were obtained by allowing them to feed on the thick-lipped wrasse, Hemigymnus melapterus, a fish species that has never been found to be infected with haemogregarines; recipients exposed to control gnathiids did not become infected with haemogregarines. Gnathiids were exposed to H. balistapi by allowing them to feed on a donor triggerfish R. aculeatus and gnathiids exposed to H. bigemina were obtained by allowing them to feed on a donor surgeonfish, the twotone tang, Zebrasoma scopas. A single specimen of the surgeonfish A. xanthopterus, that had ingested gnathiids that had fed on the donor surgeonfish Z. scopas that was infected with H. bigemina, was found later to be carrying H. bigemina. However, this conclusion is questionable as a second recipient A. xanthopterus that had ingested gnathiids from the donor triggerfish R. aculeatus infected with H. balistapi, was also found to be carrying H. bigemina. One explanation, of four possible proposed hypotheses, is that because of their feeding patterns gnathiids may carry mixed infections of haemogregarines that can be carried between gnathiid generations resulting in the unexpected H. bigemina infection. Finally, a third recipient A. xanthopterus was found to be carrying H. bigemina after gnathiids fed on a donor surgeonfish infected with this parasite had also fed on its blood. This result supports the idea that gnathiids transmit haemogregarines by bite. However, as not all gnathiids were recovered during these trials, it is possible that recipient fish also ingested some gnathiids during the experiments. While it appears that H. bigemina was transmitted to the recipient surgeonfish, whether it was through ingestion of the gnathiid by the fish or the bite of the gnathiid while feeding on the fish can not be determined with absolute certainty from these experiments. However, that H. bigemina was also found in a fish that theoretically was not exposed to gnathiids carrying this parasite, deserves further explanation and demonstrates that more studies are needed to determine how gnathiids transmit haemogregarines. Infections of H. balistapi were not detected in any of the recipient triggerfish S. chrysopterum or surgeonfish A. xanthopterus, Z. scopas or the orangespot surgeonfish, Acanthurus olivaceous. The apparent failure to transmit H. balistapi to the surgeonfish is not surprising as surgeonfish, while known hosts of H. bigemina, are not known to be a natural host of H. balistapi. The effect of haemogregarines on their vertebrate hosts, though poorly studied overall, apparently varies greatly among animal groups with some impacting significantly on several measures of condition, behaviour and physiology, with others appearing to have little effect. Here, the evaluated effect of H. balistapi on the triggerfishes R. aculeatus and S. chrysopterum was examined at Lizard Island and Moorea Island. It was noted that H. balistapi may cause destruction of the host red blood cells as the parasite often appeared to be lying adjacent to the remains of host cells. Measures of condition, haematocrit and oxygen consumption were significantly higher in parasitised R. aculeatus from Lizard Island when compared to the non-parasitised R. aculeatus at Moorea Island. The elevated levels of condition and haematocrit of the parasitised R. aculeatus, while unusual, were not thought to be detrimental for the host fish. However, the higher rate of oxygen consumption in parasitised fish, may indicate that H. balistapi does have an effect on the host. The rate of oxygen consumption in a vertebrate, can be used as a proxy for metabolic rate. Therefore, in the current study, the higher oxygen consumption rate of the parasitised fish equates to an increased metabolism and consequently increased energy requirements. It is therefore suggested that parasitised R. aculeatus may need to spend more time foraging for food to meet their increased energy requirements, which may expose them to a greater risk of predation. It is recognised, however, that the R. aculeatus from Lizard Island and Moorea Island could have differed in more than one factor and this could have contributed to the differences in condition, haematocrit and oxygen consumption that were observed. No differences were observed in the condition, haematocrit and oxygen consumption of the parasitised and non-parasitised S. chrysopterum examined at Lizard Island. However, this may have been due to the smaller sample size as only a limited number of non-parasitised S. chrysopterum were available at this site. In conclusion, H. balistapi was detected in several species of triggerfishes throughout the Indo-Pacific and varied in intensity and prevalence across this region. While H. balistapi underwent development in juvenile G. aureamaculosa, transmission experiments attempting to transmit haemogregarines to triggerfish and surgeonfish also provided the most conclusive information to date to support the hypothesis that gnathiid isopods are the vector in these fish species. However, the appearance of a haemogregarine species in a fish, different from the haemogregarine species the presumptive gnathiid vector was exposed to, raises questions about the validity of the above conclusion. Future studies should investigate haemogregarine development in the different life cycle stages of gnathiids to determine their potential for carrying several haemogregarine species between gnathiid generations. While the measures of condition, haematocrit and oxygen consumption where higher in parasitised R. aculeatus, it was suggested that only the increased oxygen consumption rates could be detrimental for the host fish. Therefore, this indicated that H. balistapi may have a significant affect on the survival of R. aculeatus. However, it is unclear from this study whether the increased oxygen consumption rates may be due to H. balistapi infections alone or whether other factors may also be involved. This study increased our knowledge of the ecology of haemogregarines, and their interactions with their hypothesized vectors, gnathiid isopods, and will further our understanding of the ecological role of haemogregarines in coral reef fishes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Haemogregarines, fish, gnathiids, transmission, parasitic</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:200748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do Better Institutions Alleviate the Resource Curse? Evidence from a Dynamic Panel Approach.</field><field name="creator">Malebogo Bakwena</field><field name="description">Contrary to conventional theory, a growing body of evidence suggests that economies with abundant natural resources perform badly in terms of economic growth relative to their resource poor counterparts&#8212;the so-called resource curse hypothesis. However, this general hypothesis is not robust. It clearly fails to account for the differing experiences of resource abundant economies. For instance, the theory, applied generally, offers no explanation as to why economies like Botswana and Norway have exceptional growth while Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have stagnated. Prompted by these experiences, the thesis investigates the circumstances under which the curse is more or less likely to exist. In particular, the thesis finds evidence that the major reason for the diverging experiences is the differences in the quality of institutions across countries. The thesis tests the hypothesis that the effect of resources on growth is conditional on the type and quality of institutions, by further building on Boschini, Pettersson, and Roine&#8217;s (2007) and Mehlum, Moene, and Torvik&#8217;s (2006b) influential works on the role of institutions in mitigating the resource curse. Advances are made by: (a) using a panel of up to 53 countries with different levels of development, institutional quality and natural resource abundance over the period 1984-2003; (b) applying a two-step system Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) estimation that accounts for biases associated with omitted variables, endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity that potentially affect existing cross-country Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) growth results; (c) supplementing results of the commonly used International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) institutional performance indicators with those of institutional design indicators&#8211;that is, highlighting the role of electoral rules and form of government; (d) using an institutional quality measure that is more related to financial institutions than just economic or political institutions; (e) using a resource abundance indicator that focuses on non-renewable resources alone rather than the ones commonly used in the literature that include renewable resources, which are inappropriate. The key hypothesis that natural resource economies are not destined to be cursed if they have good institutions is confirmed by the empirical results of the thesis. Specifically, the results suggest that (a) adopting a democratic regime is better than a non-democratic one, in terms of generating growth from resource abundance (b) the electoral rules that a country adopts matter, i.e. having a democratic proportional rather than a democratic majority regime increases the growth benefits of resource abundance (c) as far as the form of government adopted is concerned, a democratic parliamentary rather than a democratic presidential regime generates more economic growth from its abundant natural resource (d) a well functioning banking sector induces more (resource abundant generated) growth and capital accumulation. Therefore, the lessons for policy makers who struggle to overcome the impediments to economic development that potentially accompany the &#8220;curse of resource abundance&#8221; are the need to develop and maintain better institutions and adopt improved management strategies of the financial proceeds forthcoming from such abundance.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">(institutional quality, resource curse, dynamic panel, generalised method of moments)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:201841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutation-Selection Balance and the evolution of genetic variance in multiple male sexually-selected pheromones of the vinegar fly Drosophila serrata</field><field name="creator">Emma Hine</field><field name="description">The multivariate distribution of genetic variance is key to understanding two fundamental and interrelated processes in evolution; the ability of populations to respond to selection, and the balance of forces that maintain the genetic variance that such a response is based upon. In this thesis, I develop an analytical framework for characterizing the multivariate distribution of genetic variance and how it evolves. I then apply this framework to explore the evolution of genetic variance in multiple sexually-selected traits under artificial selection using the Drosophila serrata experimental system. An analytical framework for characterizing the multivariate distribution of genetic variance and how it evolves: First, I present a method from the statistical literature to establish the statistical dimensionality of genetic variance in a suite of traits. I evaluate the ability of this and two other methods to predict the correct number and orientation of dimensions of genetic variance by conducting a simulation study for a suite of eight traits. Second, I present a method from the materials science literature that uses multi-linear algebra to characterize the variation among matrices. I show how variation in the multivariate distribution of genetic variance among populations can be analyzed by constructing a fourth-order genetic variance-covariance tensor, and how the spectral decomposition of this tensor reveals independent aspects of change in genetic variance. I use the tensor to explore the variation in the genetic variance of eight traits among nine populations of D. serrata, and show how this variation can be associated with variation in selection pressures to determine whether selection may have affected genetic variance within populations. The evolution of genetic variance in sexually-selected traits under artificial selection: Female D. serrata display a strong preference for a particular combination of male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs). Individually, these pheromones display substantial genetic variance, but the genetic variance is not distributed equally among all phenotypic dimensions. In the specific CHC combination preferred by females, genetic variance is low. This is compatible with the expectation that selection will deplete genetic variance, but is contrary to the typical observation of high levels of genetic variance in individual sexually-selected traits. By artificially selecting on the trait combination preferred by females, I show that male mating success can successfully respond to selection, but the evolution of the combination of CHCs preferred by females is constrained. I then show that a key prediction of mutation-selection balance (MSB) models that has rarely been observed holds for these traits. Under MSB, genetic variance is expected to be maintained by rare alleles with large effects. Therefore, when a trait that is usually under stabilizing selection is subjected to directional artificial selection, the genetic variance is predicted to increase. I show that genetic variance increases in the CHC combination preferred by females under artificial selection, but not when another combination of the same traits with greater genetic variance is artificially selected. Complex segregation analysis indicated that the observed increase in genetic variance was a consequence of at least one allele of major effect increasing in frequency. This experiment demonstrates the importance of the past history of selection on the nature of genetic variance. General conclusion: Mutation-selection balance (MSB) is appealing as an explanation for the maintenance of genetic variance because it is simple and intuitive: the total mutation rate must be sufficiently high to replenish the variation eliminated by selection. However, MSB models seem unable to adequately explain the coexistence of the observed levels of genetic variance and strength of selection on individual traits. I contend that the failure of MSB models to explain these data is not a failure of MSB theory itself; rather it is the data that has been used to evaluate MSB models that may not be appropriate. It is now clear that there are fewer genetically independent traits than measured phenotypes, and that selection gradients measured for individual traits do not adequately reflect the nature of selection on combinations of traits. In other words, it is not possible to understand the relationship between genetic variance and selection by simply associating median levels of genetic variance and selection collated across studies as levels of genetic variance are likely to be much lower in trait combinations associated with stronger selection. Together, these observations suggest that we should be looking at the distribution of genetic variance in suites of traits and pattern of correlated selection on those same traits if we are to understand MSB.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mutation-selection balance</field><field name="subject">artificial selection</field><field name="subject">evolution of G</field><field name="subject">selection limit</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202088</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnographic study of the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Cameron Parsell</field><field name="description">Abstract People who are homeless are portrayed to be a distinct type of &#8216;homeless person&#8217;. Within scholarly research literature, their state of homelessness has been presented as informative of who they are. On both an individual and collective level, people without homes are ascribed with identities on the basis of their homelessness. Their voices and perspectives rarely contribute to broader knowledge about who they are as people. As such, the imposed &#8216;homeless identity&#8217; has the consequence of positioning them as &#8216;other&#8217; than the &#8216;normal&#8217; people with homes. Using an ethnographic approach, this study aims to understand the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless. Approximately one hundred people who slept and interacted within inner suburban Brisbane&#8217;s public places participated in this research. To learn about how they lived and who they saw themselves as individuals, I observed them, socialised with them, engaged them in informal conversations and formal interviews. This approach to fieldwork, conducted over a six month period, provided me with the opportunity to witness diverse aspects of daily lives. Further, the ethnographic engagement enabled a consideration of the ways people enacted and displayed different aspects of their identities across different social and physical places. For the individuals who participated in this study, there was a stark distinction between how they lived, on the one hand, and the type of people they identified themselves as, on the other. They were comfortable describing their lives in ways that deviated from what they saw as the &#8216;mainstream&#8217;, but at the same time, they aligned themselves with this &#8216;mainstream&#8217;. Research participants expressed a strong view that their experiences of homelessness did not offer any purchase in explaining who they were, and how they thought about the world. The public places in which they lived were perceived as problematic. Public places were dangerous and the site of unwanted interactions. Although living in public places meant that interactions and friendships with other people who were homeless was a reality, these interactions did not constitute a &#8216;homeless collective&#8217;. More fundamentally, however, living in public places meant having no legitimate places, and having limited capacity to control day-to-day lives. The participants in this research articulated stereotypical notions of what home meant to them &#8211; home was a physical structure, a house. Similarly, home was a solution to their lives as homeless. Their constructions of home can also be seen as symbolic of their aspirations to find their &#8216;place&#8217;, and engage in the &#8216;mainstream&#8217; society they feel disconnected from. While public places were associated with limited control over daily lives, the people in this research also exercised agency in enacting different aspects of their identities. Mediated by the social and physical constraints within their environment, they displayed an awareness of social expectations and emphasised elements of the self to achieve specific ends. Identities matter. An understanding of the identities of people experiencing homelessness, from their perspectives, can contribute toward the development of homelessness practice and policy responses. A distinction is made between solving problems people may have and solving homelessness. In terms of the latter, the thesis concludes that the provision of &#8216;normal&#8217; housing and the availability of support, as distinct from mandatory engagement with case management, is the most appropriate response to the needs of the people who participated in this research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">homeless people</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">public places</field><field name="subject">home</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying the impact of body composition on drug clearance: influence of study design and implications for dosing in obesity</field><field name="creator">Phey Yen Han</field><field name="description">Optimal pharmacotherapy requires an understanding of the dose-exposure (pharmacokinetics or PK) to response (pharmacodynamic or PD) relationship. Little is known about the influence of obesity on this dynamic system as PK studies in obesity have been largely descriptive rather than explanatory. This has led to a paucity of dosing guidelines for the obese, and arbitrary dose selection in the clinic. There is a need to quantify the impact of obesity on drug clearance (CL) to ensure that exposure is matched across patients of different body compositions, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes and minimising adverse events. The global aim of this thesis was to use prior published data and new clinical trial data to understand how body composition impacts upon drug CL and renal function, and to determine how clinical study design influences the identification of these relationships. Chapter 2 of this thesis determined if conventional body size descriptors that have been used to scale drug doses to body size were appropriate. In the clinical setting, a body size descriptor commonly used for determining dose requirements is total body weight (WT), based on the assumption that physiological function and PK parameters vary according to body size. However, dosing algorithms based on WT might be unsuitable for the obese due to their altered body composition which, if inaccurate, could ultimately lead to overdoses. Alternative body size descriptors such as body surface area and ideal body weight have been used, but are limited when extrapolated to obese patients as they do not take into account the covariates required to describe differences in body composition between individuals. In contrast, it was demonstrated that lean body weight (LBW), as derived by Janmahasatian et al, had the potential to scale CL across a wide range of body compositions. This literature review and systematic analysis of previously published obesity data led to the proposal of a hypothesis that body composition is sufficient to explain the influence of obesity on drug CL and that dosing for obese patients should be based on LBW. When conducting clinical studies, the selection of an appropriate body size descriptor for scaling doses across individuals of different body compositions can be aided by a study design that allows for the identification of parameter-covariate relationships which are transportable to the obese. Chapter 3 of this thesis quantified the probability of identifying these parameter-covariate relationships as a function of differing study designs. Demographics were generated using a multivariate lognormal covariate distribution with truncation at different WT limits under both a non-stratified and stratified design. PK data were simulated from a 1-compartment, first order input, first order elimination model with LBW as the covariate on CL, termed the &#8216;True Model&#8217;. The &#8216;False Model&#8217; had WT as the covariate on CL. Both models were fitted to the simulated data and the preferred model was selected based on the difference in objective function values. Each design was evaluated under differing magnitudes of random effects, as well as under a D-optimal sparse sampling scheme. It was shown under a simulation platform that the use of stratification and a wide covariate range enhanced the probability of selecting the true covariate from two competing covariate models. The aforementioned findings regarding LBW and stratification were used to design a new clinical study investigating the influence of obesity on renal drug elimination pathways. This work forms Chapters 4 and 5 of this thesis. Non-obese and obese healthy volunteers were recruited using a study design stratified for LBW. These subjects were administered a combination of four renal markers for the simultaneous assessment of various renal processes. One of the renal markers was para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), which provides an estimation of renal plasma flow (RPF). A population PK model was developed for PAH, which revealed that body size alone was insufficient to explain variability in RPF across healthy individuals of a large range of body compositions, although LBW emerged as the preferred covariate (p=0.053) among the body size descriptors tested. This weak covariate effect was in contrast with prior research supporting the use of LBW in normalising the effect of obesity on glomerular filtration rate (GFR), implying that body composition could play a greater role in influencing GFR than RPF. This thesis has applied new methods to the design of drug CL studies in obesity, and offered results and future directions to maximise the information gained from such clinical studies. A better understanding of alterations in PK and physiological function arising from changes in body composition should aid in optimising dose adjustments for obese patients, which is of great importance given the increasing prevalence of obesity in today&#8217;s society.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">lean body weight</field><field name="subject">body composition</field><field name="subject">drug clearance</field><field name="subject">renal plasma flow</field><field name="subject">clinical study design</field><field name="subject">population modelling</field><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204334</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building communities and empowering experiences? Women's voluntary work in Queensland and its place-based dimensions.</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Barbara Gail.</field><field name="description">Recent international scholarship has placed new emphasis on women&#8217;s formative role in the social, economic, political and cultural lives of their respective communities. Some researchers have suggested the greatest legacy of women&#8217;s organised contribution to those communities can be found in the history of their voluntary work. Others have urged greater recognition of that contribution through landmark recognition and historic preservation programs. To date, women&#8217;s voluntary work in Queensland has drawn limited scholarly interest and it is not well represented on the State Heritage Register. Attempts to establish links between cultural heritage and women&#8217;s history generally have been restricted to national heritage agencies in North America and Australia. However, methodologies tended to rely on existing historiography which was traditionally non-inclusive of women, and gaps in the record remained a problem. This thesis seeks to address these developments by undertaking a comprehensive gender-sensitive study of women&#8217;s voluntary work and its associated place-based dimensions, across ninety-four groups in Queensland between 1859 and 1959. A central hypothesis asserts women&#8217;s formative role as historical agents and community builders, and argues that participation in voluntary work provided opportunities to enrich and empower lives. A social history approach emphasises the diversity of women&#8217;s volunteer experiences over time and their manifestation in the built environment. The capacity of cultural heritage to effectively and comprehensively represent those experiences and map key contributions to building and shaping communities is also tested. Research confirms a direct correlation between broader historical developments and women&#8217;s volunteer responses in groups. Women reacted proactively, spontaneously and creatively to changing community needs. They committed their collective voluntary labour to address shortcomings in government policies and emerging inequalities in society, to support a nation at war and the work of various Church denominations. These findings validated women&#8217;s creative and progressive agency in volunteer-based groups to building and shaping communities, and confirmed their contribution was sustained and consistent over time. Although most volunteer experiences reflected traditional definitions of gender, more expansive opportunities were available to office-bearers, as well as those involved in self-development groups, the suffrage movement and mobilising for the war effort. Government policy did, however, attempt to restrict women&#8217;s voluntary wartime work to conventional roles, as did male-dominated ecclesiastical views within church-affiliated groups. Regardless of work or group type, evidence suggests that participation was nevertheless an empowering process. It enriched the lives of many women and facilitated their transition from the private domain of home and family to the public arena. The pioneering nature of women&#8217;s voluntary work, especially in nineteenth century Queensland, further enhanced that journey. While voluntary work over this period was dominated mostly by married upper- and middle-class women, single women were well represented. All groups benefitted from career volunteers, who displayed high levels of participation within and across groups. Many participants were motivated by strong altruist ideals, although patriotism and government propaganda played a major role during the war years, as did the influence of the Church and strong Christian beliefs for those involved in groups with a religious affiliation. A key outcome of the study is the identification of some 700 cultural heritages sites, just over half of which appear on an indicative list of places by theme. They reflect the diversity and development of women&#8217;s volunteer experiences in Queensland between 1859 and 1959 and provide tangible evidence of their sustained contribution in volunteer-based groups to processes that build and shape communities over time. Collectively, however, these sites tend to strengthen the conservative view of women&#8217;s roles, in that they were associated with services which often reflected concerns about issues impacting on home and family. Groups pursuing social or political reform were also disadvantaged in that their sites were restricted in number and frequently limited to public space and bureaucratic or ministerial offices. Likewise, the efforts of Church-based groups were diffused, given their sites of association were, in many cases, not their own. As the first of its kind in a Queensland setting, this study provides substantive findings in an area not well served by scholarly researchers in the past. It also offers an alternative gender-sensitive approach to establishing links between women&#8217;s history and cultural heritage. In addition, it has the potential to lift the visibility of women&#8217;s voluntary work through landmark recognition and historic preservation programs, whether as new entries on heritage registers, additional information for existing listings, plaque placement or memorial programs and heritage trails.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women's voluntary work in Queensland and its place-based dimensions 1859-1959</field><field name="subject">Building communities and empowering experiences</field><field name="subject">Queensland cultural heritage</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Large-scale metabolic flux analysis for mammalian cells: a systematic progression from model conception to model reduction to experimental design</field><field name="creator">Lake-ee Quek</field><field name="description">Recombinant protein production by mammalian cells is a core component of today&#8217;s multi-billion dollar biopharmaceutical industry. Transcriptome and proteome technologies have been used to probe for cellular components that correlate with higher cell-specific productivity, but have yet to yield results that can be translated into practical metabolic engineering strategies. The recognition of cellular complexity has led to an increasing adoption of systems biology, a holistic investigation approach that aims to bring together different omics technologies and to analyze the resulting datasets under a unifying context. Fluxomics is chosen as the platform context to investigate cell metabolism because it captures the integrated effects of gene expression, enzyme activity, metabolite availability and regulation, thereby providing a global picture of the cell&#8217;s metabolic phenotype. At present, the routine quantification of cell metabolism revolves around very basic cellular parameters: growth, substrate utilization and product formation. For a systems approach, however, just measuring gross metabolic features is insufficient; we are compelled to perform high-resolution, large-scale fluxomics in order to match the scale of other omics datasets. The challenges of performing large-scale fluxomics come from two opposing fronts. Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is the estimation of intracellular fluxes from experimental data using a stoichiometric model, a process very much susceptible to modelling biases. The in silico challenge is to construct the most comprehensive model to represent the metabolism of a specific cell, while the in vivo challenge is to resolve as many fluxes as possible using experimental measurements or constraints. A compromise needs to be established between maximizing the resolution of the MFA model and working within technical limitations of the flux experiment. Conventional MFA models assembled from textbook pathways have been available for animal cell culture for the past 15 years. A state-of-the-art model was developed and used to analyse continuous hybridoma culture and batch CHO cell culture data (Chapter 3). Reasonable metabolic assumptions combined with constraint based analysis exploiting irreversibility constraints enabled the resolution of most fluxes in central carbon metabolism. However, while the results appear consistent, there is insufficient information in conventional measurement of uptake, secretion and growth data to assess the completeness of the model and validity of all assumptions. 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C MFA) can potentially resolve fluxes in the central carbon metabolism using flux constraints generated from 13C enrichment patterns of metabolites, but the multitude of substrate uptakes (glucose and amino acids) seen in mammalian cells, in addition to the lack of 13C enrichment data from proteinogenic amino acids, makes it very difficult to anticipate how a labelling experiment should be carried out. The challenges above have led to the development of a systematic workflow to perform large-scale MFA for mammalian cells. A genome-scale model (GeMs), an accurate compilation of gene-protein-reaction-metabolite associations, is the starting basis to perform whole-cell fluxomics. A semi-automated method was developed in order to rapidly extract a prototype of GeM from KEGG and UniProtKB databases (Chapter 4). Core metabolic pathways in the mouse GeM are mostly complete, suggesting that these databases are comprehensive and sufficient. The rapid prototyping system takes advantage of this, making long term maintenance of an accurate and up-to-date GeM by an individual possible. A large number of under-determined pathways in the mouse GeM cannot be resolved by 13C MFA because they do not produce any distinctive 13C enrichment patterns among the carbon metabolites. This has led to the development of SLIPs (short linearly independent pathways) for visualizing these under-determined metabolic pathways contained in large-scale GeMs (Chapter 5). Certain SLIPs are subsequently removed based on careful consideration of their pathway functions and the implications of their removal. A majority of SLIPs have a cyclic configuration, sharing similar redox or energy co-metabolites; very few represent true conversion of substrates to products. Of the 266 under-determined SLIPs generated from the mouse GeM, only 27 SLIPs were incorporated into the final working model under the criterion that they are significant pathways and are potentially resolvable by tracer experiments. Most of these SLIPs are degradation pathways of essential amino acids and inter-conversion of non-essential amino acids (Chapter 8). In parallel, OpenFLUX was developed to perform large-scale isotopic 13C MFA (Chapter 6). This software was built to accept multiple labelled substrates, and no restriction has been placed on the model type or enrichment data. These are necessary features to support large-scale flux analysis for mammalian cells. This was followed by the development of a design strategy that uses analytical gradients of isotopomer measurements to predict resolvability of free fluxes, from which the effectiveness of various 13C experimental scenarios using different combinations of input substrates and isotopomer measurements can be evaluated (Chapter 7). Hypothetical and experimental results have confirmed the predictions that, when glucose and glutamate/glutamine are simultaneously consumed, two separate experiments using [U-13C]- and [1-13C]-glucose, respectively, should be performed. If there is a restriction to a single experiment, then the 80:20 mixture of [U-13C]- and [1-13C]-glucose can provide a better resolution than other labelled glucose mixtures (Chapter 7 and Chapter 8). The tools and framework developed in this thesis brings us within reach of performing large-scale, high-resolution fluxomics for animal cells and hence realising systems-level investigation of mammalian metabolism. Moreover, with the establishment of a more rigorous, systematic modelling approach and higher functioning computational tools, we are now at a position to validate mammalian cell culture flux experiments performed 15 years ago.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flux analysis</field><field name="subject">mammalian</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">metabolism</field><field name="subject">isotope labelling</field><field name="subject">stoichiometric models</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the efficiency of two parasitoids of the potato tuber moth (PTM) / by Latif Salehi.</field><field name="creator">Salehi, Latif</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 233-263.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Potato tuberworm.</field><field name="subject">Potatoes Diseases and pests Biological control.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/14768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of zinc (II) selective fluorescent ligands / Jo-Anne Margaret Pratt.</field><field name="creator">Pratt, Jo-Anne Margaret</field><field name="description">Bibliography:leaf 147.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">546.661 20</field><field name="subject">Zinc complexes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/18507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Elastin metabolisim in human lung disease / Tara J.

Analysing grazing practices for sustainability requires knowledge of annual pasture production, but little quantitative data is available. A study was undertaken to develop the capacity for predicting native pasture growth in the VRD using systems modelling. Twenty one field sites were studied for two years using a standard methodology, and the Grass Production (GRASP) model was calibrated using this field data. End of growing season total standing dry matter (TSDM) was well predicted (mean = 2513kg/ha, r2(1:1) = 0.966, RMSE = 132kg/ha, and 98% of predictions within measurement variance). Developing generic parameters for common soil and pasture types allowed extrapolation of the model. Predictive skill declined when using generic parameters (r2(1:1) = -0.265, RMSE = 807kg/ha and 64% of predictions within measurement variance). However, observation and prediction means were very similar, indicating that generic parameters are suitable for broad scale applications, but site-specific parameters are necessary if a high degree of accuracy is required. Parameters controlling plant water uptake largely determine pasture growth in low rainfall years, while nitrogen uptake and dilution parameters limit growth in high rainfall years. Pasture growth is constrained by nitrogen supply in 91% of seasons in the northern VRD, and in 25% of seasons in the drier south. Example applications of the model were demonstrated. Current and expected future levels of pasture utilisation in the district were calculated, showing a current average of 16%, rising to an expected 20% in the next decade. These levels are within the safe utilisation rates recommended for the region. Economic analysis shows positive returns ($4.54 million per year) from pasture augmentation with introduced legumes if past problems with establishment and persistence can be overcome. Model performance would be improved by accounting for simultaneous wetting of the entire profile in cracking clay soils, calculating growth of perennial and annual pasture species separately, and simulating variation in nitrogen uptake and dilution between years. Incorporation of these processes must be balanced against the increased complexity of the model and the additional data required for calibration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pastures Northern Territory Victoria River Region Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Pastures Research Northern Territory Victoria River Region</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/36784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iterative rationality in the dirty faces game</field><field name="creator">Chan, Chi-Yung (Mickey)</field><field name="description">The Dirty Faces game requires players to perform iterative reasoning in order to arrive at equilibrium play. The game is dominance solvable with a unique equilibrium when it is correctly specified. The particular payoff structure has significant implication on whether the reasoning process leads to equilibrium play. This paper illustrates that the traditional specification - as used by Weber (2001) - leads to multiple equilibria and the game loses its dominance solvability. We modify the payoff structure and restore uniqueness. The resulting game, which is dominance solvable, is implemented in an experiment to test the depth of iterative reasoning in humans. Our data analysis suggests that some deviation from equilibrium play is due to limited depth of iteration. Additionally, we find evidence that the lack of confidence in other players&#8217; iterative abilities also induces deviations from equilibrium play.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equilibium (Economics).</field><field name="subject">Game theory.</field><field name="subject">Game theory -- Econometric models.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/36785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three-dimensional tide and surge modelling and layered particle tracking techniques applied to Southern Australian coastal seas</field><field name="creator">Grzechnik, Marcus Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the development, testing, and application of computer programs for simulating Lagrangian-Stochastic particle dispersion in coastal seas, with particular application to tide and storm induced dispersion in South Australian seas.   The three-dimensional tidal equations are briefly discussed for the two types of surge models used, and finite-difference methods for numerically solving these equations are considered. Different methods of simulating flows at open sea boundaries are investigated. The method of particle tracking and the development of the particle tracking model is also described. Various tests are conducted to investigate both the advective and diffusive aspects of dispersion, and a number of scenarios for the simulation of open (ocean) and closed (coastal) boundaries are considered. Various aspects of the particle tracking routine are given specific characteristics according to the nature of the particle being considered.   Application of the tide and storm surge model to the Great Australian Bight is described. This uses spherical polar co-ordinates to account for the curvature of the earth, and an oblique boundary element to increase accuracy of the coastline representation. The effect of a low pressure system moving from west to east across the Bight and the resulting significant observed surge at Thevenard during the storm of April 1996 is simulated.   This storm resulted in a significant number of deaths in aquaculture farms containing southern bluefin tuna (Thunnas maccoyii) within the Boston Bay region to the extreme east of the Bight due to the agitation of almost neutrally buoyant organic sediments at the sea floor. The effects of this storm are further considered using a Cartesian co-ordinate fine-grid local model of Boston Bay, in Spencer Gulf, South Australia, where both tidal and storm (wind and outside surge) induced flows are simulated. The dispersion of suspended neutrally buoyant sediment throughout the region is considered, and compared with the mortalities of tuna at various farms within the region.   Tidal and storm induced currents in the Gulf St. Vincent region, South Australia, have also been modelled using Cartesian co-ordinates. Detailed consideration has been given to the modelling of tides, winds, atmospheric pressures and outside surges from the two open boundaries in Investigator Strait and Backstairs Passage. The information obtained has enabled the modelling of a number of storm surge scenarios. Further to this, various simulations of the dispersion of the larvae of the western king prawn (Penaeus latisulcatus) have been driven using the storm surge model developed. These incorporate currents near the surface and the sea floor, as well as the consideration of changes in behaviour during the life history of the larvae.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tidal, Storm Surge, Wind, Numerical Model, Finite Difference, Cartesian, Spherical, Gulf St. Vincent, Boston Bay, Great Australian Bight, Boundary Conditions, Particle Tracking, Dispersal, Western King Prawn, Southern Bluefin Tuna</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active control of sound in a small single engine aircraft cabin with virtual error sensors</field><field name="creator">Kestell, Colin David</field><field name="description">The harmful effects of aircraft noise, with respect to both comfort and occupational health, have long since been recognised, with many examples of sound control now implemented in commercial aircraft. However, the single engine light aircraft cabin is still an extremely noisy environment, which apparently has been side-lined by both cost and weight constraints, especially with respect to low frequency sound reduction. Consequently, pilots and passengers of these aircraft are still exposed to potentially damaging noise levels and hearing damage can only be avoided by the proper use of ear defenders. Minimisation of the noise around the occupants of the aircraft reduces the dependency of personal ear defenders and is conducive to a more comfortable, hygienic and less stressful environment. This thesis describes the basis of a theoretical and experimental project, directed at the design and evaluation of a practical active noise control (ANC) system suitable for a single engine light aircraft. Results from initial experiments conducted in a single engine aircraft demonstrated the viability of ANC for this application. However, the extreme noise, the highly damped cabin, the multiple tone excitation, the severe weight limitations and the requirement of air worthiness certification severely complicated the problem of achieving noise reduction throughout the entire aircraft cabin. Compromising the objective to only achieving local control around the occupants still presented difficulties because the region of attenuated noise around the error sensors was so small that a nearby observer experienced no sound level reduction whatsoever. The objective was therefore to move the control zone away from the error sensor and place a broad envelope of noise reduction immediately around the occupant's head, through the use of virtual sensors , thus creating the perception of global noise control. While virtual sensors are not new (Garcia-Bonito et al. (1996)), they are currently limited to acoustic pressure estimation (virtual microphones) via the initial measurement of an observer / sensor transfer function. In this research, new virtual sensor algorithms have been developed to: 1. minimise the sound level at the observer location, 2. broaden the control region, 3. adapt to any physical system changes and 4. produce a control zone that may ultimately follow an observer's head The performance of the virtual sensors were evaluated both analytically and experimentally in progressively more complex environments to identify their capabilities and limitations. It was found that the use of virtual sensors would, in general, attenuate the noise at the observer location more effectively than when using conventional remotely placed error sensors. Such a control strategy was considered to be ideal for a light single engine aircraft, because it would only require small light speakers (possibly fitted into a head-rest) to achieve a broad control zone that envelopes the region around the occupants heads.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active noise control, noise control mathematical models, virtual sensors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of sedimentation on the structure of a phaeophycean dominated macroalgal community.</field><field name="creator">Turner, David John</field><field name="description">Macroalgae are abundant on shallow temperate reef environments, often forming complex communities that comprise several strata. In southern Australia, these assemblages are dominated by large canopy forming taxa from the Orders Laminariales and Fucales. The presence of subtidal fucoid macroalgae differentiates these communities from that elsewhere, and emphasises the need for local studies rather than relying on generalisations made elsewhere. Like most natural systems, temperate reefs are often threatened by human activity with degradation reported from many locations in close proximity to urban settlements. The work presented in this thesis involves an examination of the temporal and spatial variability in the structure of macroalgal communities from reefs along the Adelaide (South Australia) metropolitan coast. The work looked specifically at the effects of a dispersed sediment plume, resulting from the 1997 beach sand-replenishment dredging program, on shallow sub-tidal reef systems. An examination of the structure of canopy forming phaeophycean macroalgae in Gulf St Vincent (South Australia), noted large amounts of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Notwithstanding, this variation was not random, but demonstrated considerable structure that could be linked to a number of important underlying processes. In particular, macroalgal assemblages appeared as a mosaic of patches, each of which comprised a high-density state clearly dominated by a single genus (Cystophora, Sargassum, or Ecklonia), or alternatively a lower density mixed assemblage (Variable Low Abundance, VLA). Macroalgal community structure appeared to be driven by biotic interactions at small scales (metres), such that patches comprised of different species of algae in high density states rarely abutted one another. Instead, VLA assemblages frequently formed a buffer being situated between these mono generic patches. In terms of successional processes, the high-density states appeared to be relatively stable whereas the VLA state, at least in some systems, was transitory. This finding was supported by the absence of intermediary high- density states (e.g. a mix of Cystophora and Ecklonia) implying that state changes must occur via the VLA state following some form of disturbance. Larger scale patterns appeared to be driven by environmental variation, with factors such as wave exposure influencing habitat suitability for individual species and thereby affecting community composition. These phenomena were examined in terms of life history strategies that tend to promote stability, and which are common in late successional taxa. The importance of properties enhancing stability and the role of disturbance was investigated experimentally using a dispersed sediment plume, which entirely engulfed two reefs, as a pulse impact. This disturbance was of particular relevance given that degradation of macroalgal communities in close proximity to the City of Adelaide has been, at least in part, attributed to the effects of elevated levels of sediment. Follow up surveys revealed that the sedimentation from the plume had primarily affected newly recruiting individuals, with few juveniles surviving to one year of age. Over the following few years, the effect of this recruitment failure cascaded into the adult stand. In broader terms, unfavourable climatic conditions prior to the start of the study, including a particularly severe El Nino event, had a widespread effect on local assemblages, causing high levels of both adult and juvenile mortality. As such, at the commencement of the study, macroalgal communities across the study area were in the process of recovery. This was observed at control sites over the duration of the study. In contrast, recruitment failure at the sediment-affected sites retarded the recovery process, exacerbating the problems associated with prior unfavourable climatic events and leaving them in a degraded state. This study demonstrated that macroalgal assemblages are equipped (under natural conditions) to handle 'normal' environmental fluctuations (such as inter-annual variability). However, the additional stress associated with certain anthropogenic impacts has the potential to push them over the limit, causing degradation. The loss of canopy macroalgae reduces the structural complexity of the system, leading to a concomitant reduction in their ability to recover. As such, these findings are of particular relevance to those charged with the responsibility for managing near-shore marine environments. The plume was created accidentally during a dredging operation for beach sand replenishment of Adelaide's eroding shoreline.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine algae, marine sediments, marine ecology, reefs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluoride exposure, dental fluorosis and caries among South Australian children.</field><field name="creator">Do, Loc Giang</field><field name="description">The use of fluoride involves a balance between the protective effect against caries and the risk of having fluorosis. Fluorosis in Australian children was highly prevalent in the early 1990s. Policy initiatives were introduced to control fluoride exposure so as to reduce the prevalence of fluorosis. Objective: The study aimed of describing the prevalence, severity and risk factors for fluorosis, and to escribe the trend of fluorosis among South Australian children. The study also aimed of exploring the effect of the change in fluoride exposure on dental fluorosis and caries. Methods This research project was nested in a larger population-based study, the Child Oral Health Study (COHS) in Australia 2002-2005. The parent study's sample was chosen using a multistage, stratified random selection with probability of selection proportional to population size. Fluoride exposure history was retrospectively collected by a parental questionnaire. This nested study sample (n=1401) was selected from the pool of South Australian (SA) COHS participants. Children were selected by year of birth to form three birth cohorts: those born in 1989/90; 1991/92; and 1993/94. Children were approached in two further stages: a dental health perception questionnaire, and a clinical examination for fluorosis. Some 898 children took part in the first stage. Among those, one trained dentist examined 677 children for fluorosis under clinic conditions using two indices (the Fluorosis Risk Index (Pendrys, 1990) and the TF Index (Thylstrup and Fejerskov, 1978)). The Dental Aesthetic Index score (DAI) was also recorded. Caries experience extracted from dental records of all previous visits to school dental linics was used to enable calculation of dmfs/DMFS scores at different anchor ages. Data were re-weighted age and sex to represent the South Australian child population. Per cent lifetime exposure to fluoride in water and patterns of discretionary fluoride use were calculated. Fluorosis data were used to calculate the prevalence and severity of fluorosis. Caries dmfs/DMFS scores were calculated at different anchor ages to enable comparison between birth cohorts. Results A higher proportion of children in the later birth cohorts used low concentration fluoride toothpaste, and a smaller amount of toothpaste was used when they commenced toothbrushing. There was a significant decline in the prevalence of fluorosis across the three successive birth cohorts. Risk factors for fluorosis, defined by the two indices, were use of standard fluoride toothpaste, an eating and/or licking toothpaste habit, and exposure to fluoridated water. Means (SD) of the deciduous caries dmfs scores at age six and eight were 1.45 (3.11) and 2.46 (3.93) respectively. Evaluation of the "trade-off" between fluorosis and caries with fluoride exposure indicated that the use of low concentration fluoride toothpaste and preventing an eating/licking of toothpaste habit could reduce the prevalence of fluorosis without a significant increase in caries experience. Conclusion There was a marked decline in the prevalence of fluorosis across the three successive birth cohorts. The decline was linked with the reduction in exposure to fluoride. Exposure to fluoridated water and several components of toothpaste use were risk factors for fluorosis. Establishing an appropriate use of fluoride toothpaste could be successful in reducing fluorosis without a significant increase in caries experience.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fluorosis, fluorides, dental caries in children, teeth, water fluoridation, dentistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The demonstration of estrogen receptors in various tumours: a study using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation.</field><field name="creator">Henwood, Anthony F</field><field name="description">In order to study the incidence of Estrogen Receptors (ER) in breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma and melanoma, an in situ hybridisation technique for ER mRNA (ER mRNA-ISH) was developed. Various technical aspects of the procedure including tissue fixation, hybridisation conditions, and demonstration technique were investigated in order to obtain an optimum technique for routine use. ISH results were compared with ER immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibodies ER1D5 and D5. Commercially available biotin labelled antisense oligonucleotides to ER, Poly A (total mRNA), and sense chromogranin (negative control) were applied to frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin sections of breast carcinomas. For frozen sections, various fixatives including formalin, alcohol, Schoobridge, Zamboni's and acetic- alcohol were compared. A direct streptavidin- eroxidase and an indirect demonstration method using anti-biotin were also compared. The effect of differing formamide concentrations and post hybridisation stringency washings were analysed. An optimised ISH technique was then applied to frozen sections of 21 cases of breast carcinoma and 11 cases of lung carcinoma. Results were compared to H222 staining on adjacent sections. The ISH technique was also optimised for use on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 28 breast carcinomas and 17 melanomas. The results were compared with ER1D5 and D5 immunohistochemistry done on adjacent sections. The occurrence of endogenous biotin was also studied on a range of normal tissues. Consistent ISH results were obtained when formamide was omitted from the hybridisation cocktail, high stringency post hybridisation washes were discarded, room temperature hybridisations and an indirect demonstration method were used. Fixation of frozen sections in acetic/ethanol gave more consistent results with good morphology and resulted in positive nucleolar staining in 90% of breast and 45% of lung carcinomas. Positive nucleolar staining was also present in frozen sections of one metastatic melanoma. In formalin fixed paraffin sections, acid hydrolysis and pronase treatment were required prior to ISH. Cytoplasmic and/or nucleolar ER mRNA-ISH staining was seen in 87% of breast carcinoma and 97% of melanoma studied. ER1D5 was present in 54% of breast carcinomas but was absent in all melanomas. D5, on the other hand, was found in 88% of the melanomas. In conclusion, ER mRNA-ISH can be successfully done on acetic/alcohol fixed frozen sections and formalin fixed paraffin sections. Formamide, high stringency washes and elevated hybridisation temperatures are detrimental to a successful ISH reaction and an indirect demonstration method (using anti-biotin) is preferred. Unfortunately, endogenous biotin can cause false positive ISH reactions and needs to be considered during interpretation. Results show that the localisation of ER mRNA in the nucleolus is specific. Both ER mRNA-ISH and ER immunohistochemistry indicate that melanomas and some lung carcinomas contain a receptor possibly similar to that in breast carcinomas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogen receptors, breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, immunohistochemistry, diagnostic immunohistochemistry, in situ hubridization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pressure ulcer prevention in the perioperative environment.</field><field name="creator">Berry, Judith</field><field name="description">There are many terms used to describe pressure ulcers: pressure sores, decubitus ulcers, bedsores, and pressure necrosis or ischaemic ulcers. Essentially they all describe damage to the patient's skin and underlying tissue. The nursing literature abounds with information about the risk, grading, prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. These ulcers are a problem in hospital and long term care facilities, and are a major cause of morbidity. In the hospital setting they contribute to an extended length of stay and by doing so 'block' the bed for use by another patient. The ulcers are difficult to treat, are an ongoing cause for pain and discomfort for the patient and can be a strain on hospital finances. Pressure ulcers are not unique to modern times, as they have been discovered on the remains of an Egyptian mummified body (Armstrong &amp; Bortz 2001). This would suggest that the problem dates back to the Pharoahs, and has continued to be a challenging problem throughout the centuries (Bridel 1992). The escalating costs of treating these ulcers today, has brought about an emphasis on the risk factors, prevention and the appropriate interventions, rather than an acceptance of these ulcers as a tolerable ondition (Bridel 1992). In the operating room, nurses are faced with unique challenges when caring for their patients. This is due to difficulty in caring for patients under the influence of the anaesthesia required for surgery, long periods of forced immobility and the inability of the patient to perceive pain and discomfort from the pressure of the hard surface of the operating room table. These problems are increased by nurses' inability to gain access to the patient because of the sterile drapes required to cover the patient for surgery. Armstrong and Bortz (2001) present information from one study in which it is stated that surgical patients have 90% greater chance of developing pressure ulcers than medical patients. One reason for this may be due to the limited information available in regard to the most effective support surface to place on top of the operating room table. This gap in information is problematic for operating room nurses as it limits their ability to select the most effective item of equipment, and determine if the chosen equipment reduces pressure on tissue intra- operatively. The most effective operating room table mattress used and the skills and knowledge of the operating room nurse about the aetiology and prevention of pressure ulcer prevention, are important aspects of nursing care and can influence patient outcomes. The potential for complications to occur may be dependent on single or combined factors such as the patient's age, disease processes, nutritional status and mobility. Preparatory and supportive nursing interventions for surgical procedures based on best available evidence, nursing experience and patient preference, can reduce the incidence of pressure ulcer development in the perioperative environment. This doctoral portfolio contains four separate sections related and linked together by a common theme - pressure ulcer prevention in the perioperative environment. This first section of the portfolio situates the topic and provides a brief overview of the portfolio. The second section is a critical review of the literature pertaining to the most commonly used operating room table mattresses, and the effectiveness of these mattresses in the prevention of pressure ulcer development. This review highlighted a lack of quality research in this area, and while many evaluations have been undertaken to determine the effectiveness of perating room table mattresses, the results are contradictory concerning the patients, exposures and interventions. Because of issues related to the methodological quality of published research in this area a systematic review using meta- analysis was not possible rather a critical review of the research literature is used. The third section of the portfolio reports on a hermeneutic ethnography of the perceived skills and knowledge of nurses in the prevention of pressure ulcer development in the perioperative environment. This study was designed to determine if pressure ulcer prevention forms an aspect of the everyday practice of perioperative nurses. This review has highlighted the need for operating room nurses to review practices when caring for patients in the perioperative environment particularly in respect of pressure ulcer prevention. The fourth and final section of the portfolio summarises the research and provides recommendations for nursing practice and further research in the area of pressure ulcer prevention in the perioperative environment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bedsores, pressure ulcers, nursing, surgical nursing, operating room nursing, perioperative nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new approach to the train algorithm for distributed garbage collection.</field><field name="creator">Lowry, Matthew C.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a new approach to achieving high quality distributed garbage collection using the Train Algorithm. This algorithm has been investigated for its ability to provide high quality collection in a variety of contexts, including persistent object systems and distributed object systems. Prior literature on the distributed Train Algorithm suggests that safe, complete, asynchronous, and scalable collection can be attained, however an approach that achieves this combination of behaviour has yet to emerge. The mechanisms and policies described in this thesis are unique in their ability to exploit the distributed Train Algorithm in a manner that displays all four desirable qualities. Further the mechanisms allow any number of mutator and collector threads to operate concurrently within a site; this is also a unique property amongst train-based mechanisms (distributed or otherwise). Confidence in the quality of the approach promoted in this thesis is obtained via a top-down approach. Firstly a concise behavioural model is introduced to capture fundamental requirements for safe and complete behaviour from train-based collection mechanisms. The model abstracts over the techniques previously introduced under the banner of the Train Algorithm. It serves as a self- contained template for correct train-based collection that is independent of a target object system for deployment of the algorithm. Secondly a means to instantiate the model in a distributed object system is described. The instantiation includes well-established techniques from prior literature, and via the model these are correctly refined and reorganised with new techniques to achieve asynchrony, scalability, and support for concurrency. The result is a flexible approach that allows a distributed system to exhibit a variety of local collection mechanisms and policies, while ensuring their interaction is safe, complete, asynchronous, and scalable regardless of the local choices made by each site. Additional confidence in the properties of the new approach is obtained from implementation within a distributed object system simulation. The implementation provides some insight into the practical issues that arise through the combination of distribution, concurrent execution within sites, and train-based collection. Executions of the simulation system are used to verify that safe collection is observed at all times, and obtain evidence that asynchrony, scalability, and concurrency can be observed in practice.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">object-oriented programming (computer science), refuse collection mathematical models data processing, time-series analysis mathematical models, system analysis mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active vibration control of a piezoelectric laminate plate using spatial control approach.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Yong Keat</field><field name="description">This thesis represents the work that has been done by the author during his Master of Engineering Science candidature in the area of vibration control of flexible structures at the School of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Adelaide, between March 2003 and June 2004. The aim of this research is to further extend the application of the Spatial Control Approach for two-dimensional flexible structures for attenuating global structural vibration with the possible implication of reduction in noise radiation. The research was concentrated on a simply supported thin flexible plate, using piezoelectric ceramic materials as actuators and sensors. In this work, active controllers were designed for the purpose of controlling only the first five vibration modes (0-500Hz) of the plate. A spatial controller was designed to minimize the total energy of the spatially distributed signal, which is reflected by the spatial H2 norm of the transfer function from the disturbance signal to the vibration output at every point over the plate. This approach ensures the vibration contributed by all the in bandwidth (0-500 Hz) vibration modes is minimized, and hence is capable of minimizing vibration throughout the entire plate. Within the control framework, two cases were considered here; the case when the prior knowledge of the incoming disturbance in terms of reference signal is vailable and the case when it is not available. For the case when the reference signal is available, spatial feedforward controller was designed; whereas for the case when the reference signal is not available, spatial feedback controller was designed to attenuate the global disturbance. The effectiveness of spatial controllers was then compared with that of the standard point-wise controllers numerically and experimentally. The experimental results were found to reflect the numerical results, and the results demonstrated that spatial controllers are able to reduce the energy transfer from the disturbance to the structural output across the plate in a more uniform way than the point-wise controllers. The research work has demonstrated that spatial controller managed to minimize the global plate vibrations and noise radiation that were due to the first five modes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">piezoelectric devices, damping (mechanics), vibration, acoustical engineering, structural dynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of direct observation and self- report measures of parenting behaviour.</field><field name="creator">Arney, Fiona Marie</field><field name="description">The importance of parenting behaviour as a risk factor for the development and persistence of externalising behaviour problems, and as a focus for early interventions, has led to a desire for the accurate measurement of parenting attitudes and practices. Several methods of measuring parenting behaviour have been employed in theoretical research and program evaluation, including self-report and observational measures. Both of these methods have advantages and limitations, but a systematic comparison of self-reports and observations of parenting behaviour has not been conducted. This study compared self- reports and observations of parental responsiveness and control in a sample of 68 parents of preschool children in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia. Videotaped observations of parents interacting with their children in four set tasks (free play, drawing, pack-up and no distraction) were interval-sampled using behavioural items that paralleled self- report items on the Parenting Scale and the Child-Rearing Practices Questionnaire. In addition, parents completed questionnaires about their child's behaviour and temperament, and factors associated with parenting behaviour including parental psychopathology, social support, marital adjustment, disagreements about child-rearing and demographic characteristics. Reports of children's behaviour at preschool were also obtained from teachers. When the correlations between corresponding behaviour domains on the self-report and observational measures were compared, the only significant correlation was for parental warmth. Observations of parental control practices (such as permissiveness, inconsistency and overreactivity) were not significantly associated with self-reports of these behaviours. The observational system used in this study yielded observations of permissive and inconsistent parenting that had good validity and reliability, whereas self-reports of harsh and overreactive parenting practices were more validly and reliably assessed using self-report methods. Self-reports and observations of responsive parenting practices demonstrated results that are more equivocal. Possible explanations for these results and the implications for the use of self-report and observational measures in parenting research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parenting, parent and child, parents, children, conduct disorders in children, child psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of small-molecule ligands for SH3 protein domains.</field><field name="creator">Inglis, Steven Robert</field><field name="description">Src Homology 3 (SH3) domains are small protein- protein interaction domains that bind to proline-rich peptides, mediating a range of important biological processes. Because the deregulation of events involving SH3 domains forms the basis of many human diseases, the SH3 domains are appealing targets for the development of potential therapeutics. Previously in the field, no examples of entirely small-molecule ligands for the SH3 domains have been identified. However, in our research group, we have discovered a class of heterocyclic compounds that bind to the Tec SH3 domain at conserved residues in the proline-rich peptide binding site, with weak to moderate affinity. The highest affinity of these was 2- aminoquinoline (Kd = 125 mM). In this thesis, a range of approaches are described, that were intended to contribute towards development of higher affinity small-molecule ligands for the Tec SH3 domain. Preliminary experiments, involving testing a variety of compounds structurally related to 2- aminoquinoline, provided new structure activity information, and led to a better understanding of the 2-aminoquinoline/SH3 domain binding event. The major component of this thesis is a thorough investigation into the synthesis of a range of 2- aminoquinoline derivatives. N-Substituted- 2-aminoquinolines were synthesised, however these compounds bound the SH3 domain with slightly lower affinity than 2-aminoquinoline. 6- Substituted-2-aminoquinolines were subsequently prepared, and ligands were identified with up to six-fold improved affinity relative to 2-aminoquinoline, and enhanced selectivity for the Tec SH3 domain. The techniques used for the ligand binding studies were Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shift perturbation and Fluorescence Polarisation (FP) peptide displacement assays. As part of the ligand binding studies, it was intended that the 3D tructure of a 2- aminoquinoline ligand/SH3 complex would be obtained using NMR methods, provided that a ligand was identified that bound the SH3 domain in slow exchange on the NMR timescale. However, this goal was not fulfilled. Despite this, the work presented in this thesis provides a solid foundation for the development of potent 2-aminoquinoline ligands for SH3 domains, with engineered specificity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ligands (biochemistry), proteins, cell metabolism, protein-tyrosine kinase, heterocyclic compounds</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of high precision timing in the high resolution fly's eye cosmic ray detector.</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Christopher Richard</field><field name="description">This thesis represents work performed by the author on the development of the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) detector for the study of extremely high energy (&gt;10 [superscript 18] eV) cosmic rays.

Particular emphasis is placed upon the air fluorescence technique utilised by HiRes. The two site HiRes prototype detector is then discussed in detail in chapter 3. This covers the different components that form the detector, together with details of the calibration performed to extract useful information from the data. Chapter 4 discusses the installation and subsequent testing of GPS based clock systems for the two sites that make up the HiRes prototype detector. The entire timing system was checked, and some previously hidden bugs fixed. This chapter concludes with work performed on the time to digital converter calibration for the second HiRes site. The high relative timing accuracy provided by the GPS clocks allowed the use of timing information in programs to reconstruct the arrival directions of cosmic rays. Chapter 5 covers the development of a program to use geometrical and timing information to reconstruct EAS viewed by both HiRes sites. This chapter concludes with an evaluation of the likely reconstruction accuracy of the new HiRes (stage1) detector. A well reconstructed EAS trajectory is the first step in the determination of more interesting parameters such as primary particle energy. Chapter 6 covers the collation and analysis of EAS viewed by the both sites of the prototype detector. This includes an evaluation of effects such as the atmosphere, and an estimation of the performance of the new (stage 1) HiRes detector based on results with the prototype detector. Finally the conclusions from this thesis are summarised and sugestions made for further follow up work.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmic rays</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of a physiological system: the pulmonary surfactant system in diving mammals.</field><field name="creator">Miller, Natalie J</field><field name="description">Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that lowers surface tension, increases lung compliance, and prevents the adhesion of respiratory surfaces and pulmonary oedema. Pressure can have an enormous impact on respiratory function, by mechanically compressing tissues, increasing gas tension resulting in increased gas absorption and by increasing dissolved gas tensions during diving, resulting in the formation of bubbles in the blood and tissues. The lungs of diving mammals have a huge range of morphological adaptations to enable them to endure the extremely high pressures associated with deep diving. Here, I hypothesise that surfactant will also be modified, to complement the morphological changes and enable more efficient lung function during diving. Molecular adaptations to diving were examined in surfactant protein C (SP-C) using phylogenetic analyses. The composition and function of pulmonary surfactant from several species of diving mammals was examined using biochemical assays, mass spectrometry and captive bubble surfactometry. The development of surfactant in one species of diving mammal (California sea lion), and the control of surfactant secretion using chemical and mechanical stimuli were also determined. Diving mammals showed modifications to SP-C, which are likely to lead to stronger binding to the monolayer, thereby increasing its fluidity. Phospholipid molecular species concentrations were altered to increase the concentration of more fluid species. There was also an increase in the percentage of alkyl molecular species, which may increase the stability of the monolayer during compression and facilitate rapid respreading. Levels of SP-B were much lower in the diving species, and cholesterol was inversely proportional to the maximum dive depth of the three species. Surface activity of surfactant from diving mammals was very poor compared to surfactant from terrestrial mammals. The newborn California sea lion surfactant was similar to terrestrial mammal surfactant, suggesting that these animals develop the diving-type of surfactant after they first enter the water. The isolated cells of California sea lions also showed a similar response to neuro-hormonal stimulation as terrestrial mammals, but were insensitive to pressure. These findings showed diving mammal surfactant to have a primarily anti-adhesive function that develops after the first entry into the water, with a surfactant monolayer, which would be better suited to repeated collapse and respreading.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine mammals, California sea lion, pulmonary surfactant,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A spectral approach to the transient analysis of wave-formed sediment ripples.</field><field name="creator">Davis, Joseph P.</field><field name="description">Wave-formed rippled sediment beds are extremely important to the processes that act on or across the sediment-water interface. Ripples increase the exchange of materials between the sediment and the water column, enhance sediment transport rates, and act to increase the dissipation of waves by increasing the hydraulic roughness of the seafloor. Previous research has, however, failed to take into account the substantial spatial and temporal variation rippled beds display when formed under real sea conditions. Based on a set of laboratory experiments a spectral method to predict and model rippled beds has been developed. Through the use of the rippled surface's spectral density function the spatial and temporal variability of the rippled surface can be taken into account with greater efficiency. A prediction method for the equilibrium ripple spectrum was developed based on a nondimensional spectral form, which utilised the peak orbital excursion diameter and the 50th percentile grain size diameter of the sediment bed. The method provided an effective technique to predict ripple parameters with the same degree of accuracy achievable at small scale as more accepted ripple prediction methods. A new method was derived to model the changes a rippled bed undergoes as it actively evolves between two given equilibrium states due to a change in surface wave conditions. The evolution of a rippled bed can be described mathematically in exactly the same way as a rippled bed growing from a flat bed condition. The method allows any bed to be modelled through time if the flow conditions and sediment properties are known. There is little advantage in using the spectral method to predict rippled beds when they are in equilibrium with the flow conditions. The main benefit of the spectral method comes when attempting to model rippled beds evolving under changed flow conditions. In the same way as the parameterisation of surface waves in terms of their spectral density function has increased the ability to model wind generated wave fields, studies of rippled beds would benefit from the increased detail and ease the spectral method brings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marine sediments, sediment transport, ocean currents, ocean bottom, ocean engineering, ocean waves, coastal engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting mucosal healing, reciliation, and ciliary function after endoscopic sinus surgery in the sheep.</field><field name="creator">Wabnitz, David Alexander Michael</field><field name="description">The effect of absorbable packing on the healing of nasal respiratory epthelium after endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) was examined in a diseased sheep model. Full thickness injuries were created on the lateral nasal wall of sheep infested with Oestrus ovi. Sites of injury were packed on one side with hyaluronic acid (HA) packing or hyaluronic acid packing impregnated with insulin-like growth factor- 1 (HA+IGF1) in a randomized fashion. The opposite side was left unpacked as a control. Biopsies were obtained for light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) analysis over a period of 16 weeks. Statistical analysis of results was performed in order to determine if any intervention had any impact on healing and to determine if there was any correlation between extent of regeneration as assessed by electron microscopy and CBF. Furthermore assessment of the effect of isotonic and hypertonic saline on ciliary beat frequency was performed in healthy human volunteers. Reepithelialization was increased in the HA+IGF1 group compared to the HA group and controls at eight weeks after injury but not at later time points. Cilial regeneration was improved in the HA+IGF1 group compared to the HA group and controls at 16 weeks. CBF was noted to be worse at the eight week time point with the HA+IGF1 group compared to the HA group and controls, but no other statistically significant effects on CBF were noted. This most likely represents a spurious finding. Wide distributions of CBF results were noted, reflecting numerous missing data points due to methodological difficulties. There was a trend noted toward increased CBF with improved grades of reciliation, although this correlation was not statistically significant. However this trend was supported by the finding of statistically significant differences between individual and combined grades of reciliation. Hypertonic saline was found to have a ciliostimulatory effect when compared to normal saline at 5 minutes after administration in healthy human subjects. This effect had disappeared by 60 minutes after administration. It is suggested that the presence of insulin-like growth factor- 1 at the time of mucosal injury improves epithelial regeneration in the short term, but is not sufficient for this effect to be sustained. This improved early epithelial regeneration forms a foundation for cilial regeneration, as is reflected in an improved grade of reciliation at 16 weeks. Our interventions had no effect on CBF, and various experimental problems made it difficult to provide further comment on CBF results. There is evidence that CBF improves as the grade of cilial regeneration improves following ESS. Furthermore, hypertonic saline appears to also have a positive impact on CBF, which is likely to reflect changes in the rheological properties of mucous. A number of possible avenues of enquiry are delineated and recommendations for future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nasal mucosa surgery, hyaluronic acid physiological effect, wound healing physiology, sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Virtual sensors for active noise control.</field><field name="creator">Munn, Jacqueline M</field><field name="description">The need to attenuate noise transmitted into enclosed spaces such as aircraft cabins, automobiles and mining cabins has provided the impetus for many active noise control studies. Studies into active interior noise control began with a pressure squared cost function utilising multiple error sensors and control sources in an attempt to produce global control of the interior sound field. This work found problems with observability of the primary disturbances and a large number of error sensors and control sources were required to produce global control. Since this early work in the 1980's, many new acoustic based cost functions have been developed to improve on the performance of the pressure squared cost function. This thesis will focus on one novel acoustic cost function, virtual error sensing. Virtual error sensing is a relatively new technique which produces localised zones of attenuation at a location remote to the physical sensors. The practical advantage of this method is the people within these enclosed spaces are able to observe a reduction in sound pressure level without their movement being restricted by error sensors located close to their ears. The aim of this thesis is to further investigate the performance of forward-difference virtual error sensors in order to understand the factors that affect the accuracy of the pressure prediction at the virtual location and use this information to develop more accurate and efficient forward- difference virtual sensors. These virtual sensors use linear arrays of microphones containing two or more microphone elements and a linear or quadratic approximation is used to predict the sound at the virtual location. The prediction method determines the weights applied to each microphone signal to predict the sound pressure level at the virtual location. This study investigates susceptibility of the sensors to corruption as a result of phase and sensitivity mismatch between the microphones, as well as in the location of the elements in the error sensing array. A thorough error analysis of the forward-difference virtual microphones was performed in a one-dimensional sound field and in a plane wave sound field. The accuracy of the quadratic virtual microphone was found to be strongly affected by the presence of short wavelength extraneous noise. From this study, two novel virtual error sensing techniques were developed, namely; higher-order virtual sensors and adaptive virtual sensors. The higher-order virtual error sensors still employ the linear and quadratic prediction method but extra microphone elements are added to the array. The aim of these higher-order virtual microphones is to produce a more accurate prediction of the pressure at the virtual location by spatially filtering out any short wavelength extraneous noise that may corrupt the prediction. These virtual sensors were tested in a realtime control scenario in both a one-dimensional reactive sound field and in a free field. This work found that the higher-order virtual microphones can improve the prediction accuracy of the original virtual sensors but are still prone to problems of phase, sensitivity and position errors. Finally, the adaptive LMS virtual sensors were investigated in a SIMULINK simulation and tested experimentally using real-time control in a one-dimensional sound field. It was hoped that an adaptive LMS algorithm could overcome previous difficulties arising from inherent and transducer errors by adapting the weights of the signals from the sensing elements which form the array. The algorithm adapts the sensing microphone signals to produce the same signal as the microphone at the virtual location. Once this has been achieved, the sensing microphone weights are fixed and the microphone at the virtual location is removed, thus creating a virtual microphone. The SIMULINK simulation allowed the performance of the fixed weight and virtual microphones to be investigated in the presence of only phase errors, sensitivity errors and position errors and in the presence of all three combined. This work showed that the adaptive virtual sensors had the ability to compensate for the errors. The number of modes used in the simulations was varied to observe the performance of all virtual sensors in the presence of higher-order modes. The prediction accuracy of the fixed weight virtual sensors was found to be greatly affected by the presence of higher-order modes. The use of the adaptive virtual microphones to produce localised zones of quiet was examined experimentally using real-time control. The study found the real-time control performance is superior to that of the fixed weight higher-order virtual microphones and the original forward-difference virtual microphones.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">active noise and vibration control, acoustical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental study of stimulated Brillouin scattering in open cells and multimode optical fibres.</field><field name="creator">Wong, Allan Chi-lun</field><field name="description">An experimental study of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) were performed by performing optical phase conjugation in open cells and multimode optical fibres using a Q-switched, pulsed Nd:YAG laser (&#955; = 1.064&#956;m).

At the same time, there are large gaps in our understanding of the hydrodynamics, structural engineering, and economics of high-speed vessels. Monohulls, catamarans, trimarans, surface effect ships, and air cushion vehicles are considered in the present work. The total resistance of these vehicles is divided into separate components which are estimated using different methods. Skin-friction is estimated using Grigson's algorithm which gives much better predictions of flat plate skin-friction than the traditional ITTC method. Wave resistance of displacement hulls is estimated using Michell's thin-ship theory: a similar theory is used for the wave resistance of travelling pressure distributions. Several simple formulae are derived that can be used in the preliminary design stage of catamarans to estimate optimum demihull separation. Memetic algorithm techniques are used to find vessels with minimum (calm-water) total resistance. Optimal geometric parameters are found for vessels of 1200 tonnes under a variety of geometric limitations and constraints on upright stability, at design speeds of 50 knots and 75 knots. Estimates are made of the principal weight components of the optimal vessels. Empirical formulae for the efficiencies of powerplants and propulsors then enable estimates to be made of the maximum range, the cargo capacity, and the fuel consumption.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrodynamics</field><field name="subject">Ship resistance</field><field name="subject">Wave resistance (Hydrodynamics)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing the Goddess.</field><field name="creator">Kelen, Stephen Kenneth</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises a creative work, the manuscript of a book of poems, Goddess of Mercy, and an exegesis, A Further Existence, which explores the creative, aesthetic, philosophical and other ideas and inputs that went into writing the poems. Goddess is a collection of idylls of the electronic age, narratives, dramas, fictions and meditations. The poems are various in style and subject matter. The exegesis begins with the author's earliest remembered experiences of poetry, considers a wide range of poetries and goes some way to proposing an open poetic that allows a writer versatility in approach to subject matter and writing style. Poems can transcend their time and place to create a 'further existence' where temporality is irrelevant. A diverse range of poems are examined -- from ancient Babylonian to contemporary Australian -- to determine the aspects of a poem that take it beyond daily speech. The usefulness and limitations of theory are considered. The art's mystical dimensions are not easy to analyse but are still worth thinking about: the mysterious spark or talent for poetry, how and where a poem occurs, epiphanies, 'being in the zone' and when all the words come rushing at once. The persistence of poetry is noted: poetry still manifests itself in public life through newspapers, sport, pop music, radio commentary, television, and politics, as well as in everyday living. Poetry adapts to new environments like the internet. Conversely, events in the 'real world' influence poetic thought and writing as evidenced by the barrage of poems and publishing in response to the US invasion of Iraq. Some recent Australian poems are explored with regard to establishing contexts and areas of interest for the practice of poetry in the opening years of the twenty-first century, with a view to establishing the contexts in which the poems in Goddess exist and the world they address.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing, poetry, poetics, versification, Stephen K.

By consistently acting in a manner that is above the capacity of normal human beings, a hero becomes a model of emulation and inspiration for ordinary, lesser mortals. This thesis traces the development of normative models of heroic thought and action in the work of Homer, Plato and Rousseau. It argues that models of heroism have evolved according to changing conceptions of the political institutions that comprise a polis and, in turn, notions of citizenship. Homer establishes the heroic ideal and offers an image of Man as Hero. The Homeric hero is a man of transparent action who is never incapacitated because he acts upon his instincts. Unrestrained by doubt, he soars above humanity and performs deeds that assure him of everlasting fame and glory. The Homeric hero is a warrior-prince who lives in the absence of a polis. He rules his community as a patriarch who places his personal quest for glory above the dictates of the common good. The Homeric hero is consequently limited in his ability to act as a model of emulation for those who live in a polis. In an historical period that gave rise to the polis as a desirable and unavoidable aspect of human life, Plato remodels heroic ideals. Thus Plato's ideals of heroism could survive and prosper alongside political structures and institutions guided by the demands of the common good. The philosophical hero exalted in the Platonic dialogues gains true knowledge, which enables him to excel at all activities he undertakes. The philosopher is impelled to channel his vast superiority into the realm of political leadership. Plato recasts the Hero as Citizen, an elite citizen who rules for the benefit of all. Plato's model of heroism, like Homer's, is premised on an anti-egalitarian, hierarchical conception of human worth. In the Social Contract, Rousseau aims to reconcile modern ideals of human equality with Homeric and Platonic hierarchical notions of heroic excellence. The Social Contract attempts to make all citizens equally heroic by insisting that men can only excel when they all participate equally in political sovereignty. Failing to reconcile heroism and equality, however, Rousseau chooses heroism and reverts firstly to aristocratic political formulas before finally abandoning politics altogether as a positive force for humanity. His work nevertheless inspired both a lasting notion of human equality that shaped the modern political landscape and evoked the romantic modern notion of an isolated individual, as epitomised by Rousseau himself, heroically climbing the peaks of human achievement. Rousseau's model of individual heroism effectively completes the cycle and returns the notion of heroism to where it begun with Homer, Man as Hero. The concept of the heroism, traced through these theorists, shows it to be a changing terrain yet consistent in its allure.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plato influence, Homer influence, heroes, Rousseau, Jean-Jacques 1712-1778 influence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of partial rootzone drying on grapevine physiology and fruit quality.</field><field name="creator">Stoll, Manfred</field><field name="description">Growth, productivity and fruit quality of grapevines are closely linked to soil water availability. Withholding of water for any length of time results in slowed growth. If drought continues yield may be lost. Vines can be manipulated to stimulate early defence mechanisms by decreasing soil water availability. By using an irrigation technique, which allows for separate zones with different soil moisture status, it is possible to stimulate response mechanisms of the root system which are normally related to water stress. The difficulty of separating 'wet' and 'dry' zones was initially overcome by using split-root plants with root systems divided between two containers. Such experiments on split-root model plants resulted in the development of an irrigation technique termed partial rootzone drying (PRD). Results from irrigation experiments using PRD have shown that changes in stomatal conductance and shoot growth are some of the major components affected (Dry et al., 1996). The idea of using irrigation as a tool to manipulate stress responses in this way had its origin in the concept that root- derived abscisic acid (ABA) was important in determining stomatal conductance (Loveys, 1984). Later experiments on split-root plants have demonstrated that many effects of water stress can be explained in terms of transport of chemical signals from roots to shoots without changes in plant water status (Gowing et al., 1990). The necessary chemical signals are provided by the dry roots, and the wet roots prevent the development of deleterious water deficits. The general hypothesis tested during this study was that partial drying of the root system gives rise to a change in the supply of root-derived chemical signals which determine changes in grapevine physiology, thereby affecting fruit quality. Experiments were conducted on split-root vines (Vitis vinifera L. cvs. Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay) grown in pots of different sizes, on field-grown vines which had either their root system divided by a plastic membrane (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon on own roots or grafted on Ramsey rootstocks) or conventional vines with a non-divided root system (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Riesling) with a commercial PRD irrigation design. The irrigation treatments were vines receiving water on both sides (control) and PRD-treated vines, which only received water on one side at any time. The frequency of alternation of 'wet' and 'dry' sides was determined according to soil moisture and other influences such as rainfall and temperature. In most of the experiments the irrigation was alternated from one side to the other every 10 to 15 days. Chemical signals from roots: the role of ABA and cytokinins Studies on chemical signals have concentrated on ABA and cytokinins (CK). An improved stable isotope dilution protocol, which enables analysis of ABA and CK from the same tissue sample, was developed. Analysis of cytokinins focused on zeatin (Z), zeatin riboside (ZR), zeatin glucoside (ZG) and iso pentenyl adenine (iP). Roots are relatively inaccessible, particularly in field situations. To enable easier access to roots of field-grown vines, split-root vines were planted in a trench which was refilled with a sandy soil. This created a homogenous soil substrate and did not restrict root growth while still allowing access to roots under field conditions. Analyses of root samples of field-grown vines have shown that cytokinins and ABA may originate in roots and their concentrations can be substantially altered during an irrigation cycle. Alternating soil water conditions showed that [ABA] in roots on the 'dry' side was significantly higher compared with the 'wet' side. Due to a reduction in CK on the 'dry' side of PRD-treated vines, the ratio between ABA and CK was substantially changed during an irrigation cycle. The ABA levels in root tissue and in petiole xylem sap were negatively related to stomatal conductance. This further suggests that ABA, mostly synthesized on the 'dry' side of the root system, might be responsible for a decline in stomatal conductance. Furthermore, a higher pH of petiole xylem sap was observed in PRD-treated vines which may also contribute to the regulation of stomatal conductance. Studies on stomatal patchiness showed that non-uniform stomatal aperture occurred in field-grown vines under natural environmental conditions and was more abundant under PRD conditions. The degree of stomatal opening, determined by using a water infiltration technique, correlated with measurement of stomatal conductance. Exogenous application of a synthetic cytokinin (benzyl adenine) can override the possible ABA-mediated stomatal closure resulting from PRD treatment, providing further evidence for the in vivo role of these growth regulators in the control of stomatal conductance. The effect of benzyl adenine was transient, however, requiring repeated applications to sustain the reversal. In addition, CKs may also be important in influencing grapevine growth. Following several weeks of repeated spray applications with benzyl adenine, it was found that the development of lateral shoots in PRD-treated vines was enhanced compared to PRD-treated vines sprayed with water only. This supports the idea that the reduction in lateral shoot development seen in PRD-treated vines is due to a reduced production of CKs (Dry et al., 2000a). By measuring shoot growth rate it was found that one common feature of PRD-treated vines, which were not sprayed with CK, was a reduction of lateral shoot growth. It can therefore be speculated that the reduction in lateral growth is related to a reduced delivery of cytokinins from the roots. Zeatin and zeatin riboside concentration in shoot tips and prompt buds/young lateral shoots were reduced by the PRD treatment providing further evidence in support of this hypothesis. Water movement from 'wet' to 'dry' roots Roots, being a primary sensor of soil drying, play an important role in long- and short-term responses to PRD. Using stable isotopes of water and heat-pulse sap flow sensors water movement was traced from wet to dry roots in response to PRD. The redistribution of water from roots grown in a soil of high water potential to roots growing in a soil of low water potential may be of significance with regard to the movement of chemical signals and the control of water balance of roots. Measurements of the relative water content (RWC) have shown a slower decline of RWC of the 'dry' roots of PRD vines relative to roots of vines which received no water, despite similar water content in soil surrounding those roots. The redistribution of water may help to sustain the response to PRD for longer periods possibly releasing chemical signals and to support the activity of fine roots in drying soil. Field vines, irrigated with PRD over several growing seasons, altered their root distribution relative to the control vines. PRD caused a greater concentration of fine roots to grow in deeper soil layers and this may contribute to a better water stress avoidance. The effect on root growth may be augmented by the water movement and by the large difference in ABA to cytokinin ratio, which are also known to alter root growth. PRD makes more efficient use of available water In experiments where both control and PRD-treated vines received the same amount of water many differences between the vines were demonstrated. Under conditions where water supply was adequate for both treatments, the stomatal conductance and growth of the PRD-treated vines was restricted as has been observed in many previous experiments. As total water input was reduced, however, the stomatal conductance of PRD-treated vines became greater than control vines, suggesting that the latter were experiencing a degree of water stress, whereas the PRD-treated vines were not. This may have been due to the greater depth of water penetration in the case of the PRD-treated vines, where water was applied to a smaller soil surface area. This distinction between PRD-treated and control vines, at very low water application rates, was also reflected in pruning weights and crop yields which were actually greater in PRD-treated vines. It was concluded that at low water application rates, the PRD-treated vines were more tolerant of water stress and made more efficient use of available water. Reduction in vigor opens the canopy. The initial aim of the research which led to the development of PRD was to achieve better control of undesirable, excessive shoot and foliage growth which, from a viticultural point of view, has many disadvantages. Grapevine shoot growth rate responds very sensitively to drying soil conditions. The irrigation strategy used in the PRD experiments maintained a reduction of both main shoot and lateral shoot growth. In response to PRD a decrease in shoot growth rate and leaf area was observed. Much of the reduction in canopy biomass was due to a reduced leaf area associated with lateral shoots, thus influencing the canopy structure. This was one major factor improving the light penetration inside the canopy. Control of vegetative vigour results in a better exposure of the bunch zone to light and, as a consequence, in improved grape quality. It is likely that changes in canopy density, as a result of PRD, is causing changes in fruit quality components. Anthocyanin pigments such as derivatives of delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin and peonidin were more abundant in berries from PRD vines; by comparison the concentration of the major anthocyanin, malvidin, was reduced. When leaves were deliberately removed from more vigorous control vines, which improved bunch exposure, the differences in fruit composition were much reduced. This further supports the idea that a more open canopy, in response to PRD, improves fruit quality by affecting the canopy structure. Fruit quality consequently determines the quality, style and value of the finished wine. Wines from this study have been produced and data on wine quality from commercial wineries are also available. Sensory evaluations have demonstrated that high wine quality from PRD-treated vineyards can be achieved without any yield-depressing effects. This study has provided evidence to support the original hypothesis. The major findings were: a) Chemical signals, altered under PRD and mostly originating from roots, play an important role in the root to shoot communication in grapevines. b) The movement of water from 'wet' to 'dry' soil layers may help to sustain chemical signals as a response of grapevines to PRD and to support the activity of fine roots in drying soil. c) A reduction in vegetative growth, in particular of lateral shoots, was sustained using PRD and affected the canopy structure which in turn, due to a better light penetration into the canopy, improved the fruit quality. d) The reduction in irrigation water applied did not have a detrimental effect on grape yield and thus the efficiency of water use was improved. e) Application of relatively low irrigation rates showed that PRD-treated vines were more tolerant of water stress and made more efficient use of available water.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">viticulture, grapes, soil moisture, irrigation, plant-water relationships, plant-soil relationships, roots (botany)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of mycorrhizal symbiosis in growth and phosphorus nutrition of wheat in a highly calcareous soil.</field><field name="creator">Li, Huiying</field><field name="description">The overall objective of the work presented in this thesis was to investigate roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM ) fungi in growth and phosphorus ( P ) nutrition of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. ) in a highly calcareous soil from the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. The soil used for this study is one of the main soil types used for wheat production in South Australia. It is severely P - deficient, but plant responses to conventional fertiliser application are poor. Although the total P and Colwell - extractable P contents of the soil are high, the resin - extractable P content is very low. Resin - extractable P is better able to predict P availability for plant growth than Colwell - extractable P. The soil is also strongly P - fixing. Moderate levels ( about 20 mg kg [superscript minus 1] ) of resin - extractable P for wheat could only be achieved by adding high rates ( up to 100 mg kg [superscript minus 1] ) of CaHPO4 in this soil. A bioassay with wheat showed that it can be highly colonised by AM fungi in the soil. AM fungi have been shown to improve P nutrition of plants, particularly in nutrient poor soils. They may thus be important for wheat grown in the soil with low amounts of plant - available P such as the one used. The first part of the work involved conventional pot experiments. Effects of AM fungi on wheat were compared between sterilised soil and non - sterile soil, sterilised soil inoculated with non - sterile soil or with Glomus intraradices or noninoculated, with different soil / sand mixes. Colonisation of wheat at 8 weeks was high, with about 75 % of root length colonised for indigenous fungi and 55 % for Glomus intraradices, regardless of the soil treatments. Growth and P uptake of wheat were significantly increased by both indigenous fungi and G. intraradices, irrespective of soil / sand mixes. Effects of indigenous fungi on plant growth were larger in sterilised and inoculated soil than in non - sterile soil. In sterilised soil, increases of plant growth by AM fungi were higher with G. intraradices than with indigenous fungi. Dilution of the soil by mixing with sand reduced plant growth and P uptake of both AM and non-mycorrhizal ( NM ) plants. In another experiment, responses of wheat to AM fungi and P supply were compared with those of clover. Plants were inoculated with four different AM fungi. Colonisation of wheat was lower than clover. Although suffering from P deficiency, NM wheat ( 6 weeks ) grew relatively well with no added P ( P0 ) and application of P at 100 mg kg [superscript minus 1] ( P100 ) increased the dry weight ( DW ). Shoot P concentrations increased with P application and there were positive effects of all AM fungi at P100. In contrast, NM clover ( 8 weeks ) grew very poorly at P0 and did not respond to P application. Clover responded positively to all AM fungi at both P levels, associated with increases in P uptake. The results showed that responses of wheat to AM inoculation and P supply were quite different from those of clover, and emphasized the different abilities of the two species to access P in the very high P - fixing soil used. Responses of two wheat cultivars ( Brookton and Krichauff ) to AM fungus ( G. intraradices ) were also evaluated with different P supplies at two developmental stages ( vegetative and maturity ). Colonisation by G. intraradices of both cultivars was well established at 6 weeks ( ~ 50 % in P0 plants ) and continued to increase up to maturity ( ~ 70 % ), but decreased greatly at both harvests as P supply was increased ( up to 150 mg P kg [superscript minus 1] ). Addition of P significantly increased plant growth, grain yield and P uptake irrespective of cultivar and harvest time, and the optimum soil P for grain yield was 100 mg kg [superscript minus 1]. In both cultivars, a growth depression in AM plants occurred at 6 weeks at all P levels, but this disappeared at 19 weeks with added P. At P0, AM plants produced lower grain yield per plant, but with higher P supply, AM plants produced higher grain yields than NM plants. There was a significant positive effect of AM on grain P concentration at P0, but not at other P levels. Brookton was somewhat more P efficient than Krichauff, and the latter responded more to AM fungi. The results showed that responses of wheat to AM fungi and P supply changed during development. Growth depression induced by AM fungi in low P soil was overcome by addition of moderate amounts of P, resulting in significant increases in grain yield in AM plants. Additional approaches were used to help determine the roles of AM fungi in wheat growth and nutrition. The effects of plant density were tested, as it was expected that increasing density might decrease the negative effects of AM fungi on wheat growth. Large growth depressions were induced by both G. intraradices and Gigaspora margarita in wheat grown at low density, although % colonisation by G. intraradices was higher than by Gi. margarita. With increasing plant density, the growth depressions were smaller, indicating that competition modulates growth responses. Although there may be effects due to competition for soil P, it is clear that with increasing plant biomass per unit soil volume, the AM fungal biomass did not increase in proportion ; in fact, hyphal length density decreased. Accordingly, costs of AM in terms of organic carbon loss per plant decreased with increasing plant density, thus mitigating the growth depression. The results add to the increasing body of evidence that mycorrhizal growth responses of plants grown singly may not apply at the population or community level as in crops. Two compartmented pot systems were used to examine whether the fungal hyphae deliver the P into the plants even in the absence of positive growth responses. An experiment in which plants were constricted in a mesh bag, but hyphae of AM fungi could explore a large soil volume was carried out. Results suggested that AM fungi helped the plants acquire P, although mesh bags did not remove AM growth depression. The experiments in which AM fungi were supplied with [superscript 32]P in a small soil compartment to which only hyphae had access showed that a considerable amount of P was delivered to wheat plants via AM fungi. The original aim was to calculate the percentage of total P entering the plants via the AM pathway. However, realistic values were not obtained probably because of difficulties of determining plant-available P and uneven distribution of hyphae in the soil. It is also possible that plants and AM fungi access different P pools. This study demonstrated the potential roles of AM fungi in growth and P nutrition of wheat grown in the highly calcareous soil from the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. Further studies on the effects of the interactions between AM fungi and wheat in the field are needed to assess the contribution of AM fungi to plant nutrition.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">symbiosis, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas, mycorrhizas, wheat, phosphorus in agriculture, calcareous soils</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scale parameter modelling of the t-distribution</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Julian</field><field name="description">This thesis considers location and scale parameter modelling of the heteroscedastic t-distribution. This new distribution is an extension of the heteroscedastic Gaussian and provides robust analysis in the presence of outliers as well accommodates possible heteroscedasticity by flexibly modelling the scale parameter using covariates existing in the data. To motivate components of work in this thesis the Gaussian linear mixed model is reviewed. The mixed model equations are derived for the location fixed and random effects and this model is then used to introduce Restricted Maximum Likelihood ( REML ). From this an algorithmic scheme to estimate the scale parameters is developed. A review of location and scale parameter modelling of the heteroscedastic Gaussian distribution is presented. In this thesis, the scale parameters are a restricted to be a function of covariates existing in the data. Maximum Likelihood ( ML ) and REML estimation of the location and scale parameters is derived as well as an efficient computational algorithm and software are presented. The Gaussian model is then extended by considering the heteroscedastic t distribution. Initially, the heteroscedastic t is restricted to known degrees of freedom. Scoring equations for the location and scale parameters are derived and their intimate connection to the prediction of the random scale effects is discussed. Tools for detecting and testing heteroscedasticity are also derived and a computational algorithm is presented. A mini software package " hett " using this algorithm is also discussed. To derive a REML equivalent for the heteroscedastic t asymptotic likelihood theory is discussed. In this thesis an integral approximation, the Laplace approximation, is presented and two examples, with the inclusion of ML for the heteroscedastic t, are discussed. A new approximate integral technique called Partial Laplace is also discussed and is exemplified with linear mixed models. Approximate marginal likelihood techniques using Modified Profile Likelihood ( MPL ), Conditional Profile Likelihood ( CPL ) and Stably Adjusted Profile Likelihood ( SAPL ) are also presented and offer an alternative to the approximate integration techniques. The asymptotic techniques are then applied to the heteroscedastic t when the degrees of freedom is known to form two distinct REMLs for the scale parameters. The first approximation uses the Partial Laplace approximation to form a REML for the scale parameters, whereas, the second uses the approximate marginal likelihood technique MPL. For each, the estimation of the location and scale parameters is discussed and computational algorithms are presented. For comparison, the heteroscedastic t for known degrees of freedom using ML and the two new REML equivalents are illustrated with an example and a comparative simulation study. The model is then extended to incorporate the estimation of the degrees of freedom parameter. The estimating equations for the location and scale parameters under ML are preserved and the estimation of the degrees of freedom parameter is integrated into the algorithm. The approximate REML techniques are also extended. For the Partial Laplace approximation the estimation of the degrees of freedom parameter is simultaneously estimated with the scale parameters and therefore the algorithm differs only slightly. The second approximation uses SAPL to estimate the parameters and produces approximate marginal likelihoods for the location, scale and degrees of freedom parameters. Computational algorithms for each of the techniques are also presented. Several extensive examples, as well as a comparative simulation study, are used to illustrate ML and the two REML equivalents for the heteroscedastic t with unknown degrees of freedom. The thesis is concluded with a discussion of the new techniques derived for the heteroscedastic t distribution along with their advantages and disadvantages. Topics of further research are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">Heteroscedasticity</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An extended Mumford-Shah model and improved region merging algorithm for image segmentation</field><field name="creator">Tao, Trevor</field><field name="description">In this thesis we extend the Mumford-Shah model and propose a new region merging algorithm for image segmentation. The segmentation problem is to determine an optimal partition of an image into constituent regions such that individual regions are homogenous within and adjacent regions have contrasting properties. By optimimal, we mean one that minimizes a particular energy functional. In region merging, the image is initially divided into a very fine grid, with each pixel being a separate region. Regions are then recursively merged until it is no longer possible to decrease the energy functional. In 1994, Koepfler, Lopez and Morel developed a region merging algorithm for segmentating an image. They consider the piecewise constant Mumford-Shah model, where the energy functional consists of two terms, accuracy versus complexity, with the trade - off controlled by a scale parameter. They show that one can efficiently generate a hierarchy of segmentations from coarse to fine. This algorithm is complemented by a sound theoretical analysis of the piecewise constant model, due to Morel and Solimini. The primary motivation for extending the Mumford-Shah model stems from the fact that this model is only suitable for " cartoon " images, where each region is uncomtaminated by any form of noise. Other shortcomings also need to be addressed. In the algorithm of Koepfler et al., it is difficult to determine the order in which the regions are merged and a " schedule " is required in order to determine the number and fine - ness of segmentations in the hierarchy. Both of these difficulties mitigate the theoretical analysis of Koepfler ' s algorithm. There is no definite method for selecting the " optimal " value of the scale parameter itself. Furthermore, the mathematical analysis is not well understood for more complex models. None of these issues are convincingly answered in the literature. This thesis aims to provide some answers to the above shortcomings by introducing new techniques for region merging algorithms and a better understanding of the theoretical analysis of both the mathematics and the algorithm ' s performance. A review of general segmentation techniques is provided early in this thesis. Also discussed is the development of an " extended " model to account for white noise contamination of images, and an improvement of Koepfler ' s original algorithm which eliminates the need for a schedule. The work of Morel and Solimini is generalized to the extended model. Also considered is an application to textured images and the issue of selecting the value of the scale parameter.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Image processing Digital techniques Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Computer vision Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37749</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of Cosmic Ray Composition using a Hybrid Fluorescence Detector</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Kenneth Mark</field><field name="description">This thesis describes several aspects of cosmic ray composition studies using the Utah Fly's Eye and High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) detectors.        The Fly's Eye detector utilises the atmospheric fluorescence technique to measure the development of cosmic ray cascades as they pass through the atmosphere. This is complementary to the surface array technique, as used by the Akeno experiment in Japan, which measures the electromagnetic and muon content of air showers at a single observation level. For some time it was thought that Fly's Eye and Akeno gave inconsistent composition results. In Chapter 4 I show that the inconsistency is due, for the most part, to a difference in the assumptions made about hadronic interactions.        In Chapter 5 I present analysis of the composition between 10^17 and 10^18 eV using the prototype High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) detector in coincidence with the Michigan Muon Array (MIA). The hybrid nature of these measurements gives us more information about cosmic ray showers than either technique on its own. The consistency or otherwise of the composition measured by the two detectors is discussed.        Finally, in Chapter 6, I discuss a method of extracting the total proton-proton cross section from the cosmic ray data. This information is of interest because it is derived at centre of mass energies much higher (by at least an order of magnitude) than those currently accessible by collider experiments. I present a preliminary calculation of the cross section using the HiRes/MIA hybrid data set.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmic rays, cosmic radiation, fluorimetry, fluorescence detector</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Endogenous serum testosterone in man: ageing, the metabolic syndrome, functional decline and the role of supplementation</field><field name="creator">Haren, Matthew Timothy</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the age - related decline in the various available measures and estimates of serum testosterone levels in men. Testosterone circulates predominantly bound with high affinity to sex - hormone binging globulin ( SHBG ) in plasma ( ~ 60 % ) and with lower affinity to albumin ( &lt; 40 % ) ; approximately 1 - 2 % circulates unbound in plasma. It is the albumin - bound and free fractions ( termed " bioavailable testosterone " ) that are most likely to have biological effects on target tissues. This thesis reports the establishment, validation and derivation of normal ranges for an ammonium sulphate precipitation method for the measurement of bioavailable testosterone in serum. This method is in use by a number of laboratories at present including the laboratory of Professor John Morley at St Louis University with whom we collaborated. Testosterone has been shown, both cross - sectionally and longitudinally, to decline progressively beginning around the age of thirty. Total testosterone declines at approximately 0.4 % per year while bioavailable and free testosterone decline at approximately 1.2 % per year. The mechanisms that may be responsible for this include age - related changes to the hypothalamic - pituitary - testicular axis, increased SHBG levels, environmental factors, medication and chronic illness. This decline may contribute to a multitude of physiological, psychosexual and cognitive changes associated with ageing in men. This thesis crosssectionally examines the possible determinants of the various fractions of serum testosterone and the associations with various physical, psychosexual and lifestyle variables and with chronic disease and medication use. These cross - sectional data were generated from the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing study, which randomly recruited 568 men from the north and west suburbs of Adelaide, between August 2001 and August 2002. Moreover, this thesis includes a randomised controlled trial of testosterone replacement therapy in men aged 60 years and over with low - normal testosterone levels at baseline, recruited by newspaper advertisement. The goals of testosterone replacement therapy might be to prevent osteoporosis, age related frailty and falls, and to maintain optimal physical, sexual, emotional and cognitive health during the ageing process. This intervention study focused on the effect of treatment on body composition and muscle strength, symptoms of testosterone deficiency, visuospatial cognition, mood, wellbeing and quality of life. Finally, preliminary work was initiated to develop an in vitro bioassay for the measurement of serum testosterone bio - action. This was done using a transient transfection protocol in cultured cells, where androgen receptor and androgen response elements were introduced into the cells, subsequently treated with testosterone containing media and the amplitude of response quantified using a dual - luciferasereporter assay. In summary, this thesis discusses the issues with the measurement of testosterone in plasma and the factors that determine the concentration of the various fractions of testosterone in plasma. A cross - sectional study, using random recruitment procedures was used to investigate associations between testosterone levels and health - related - factors and finally a randomised - controlled - trial of testosterone replacement in ageing men with low - normal testosterone levels is reported. Throughout the thesis, the following themes are common ; body composition, physical function and strength, sexual function, lower urinary tract symptoms and the prostate, visuospatial cognition, mood, quality - of - life and wellbeing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hormones, testosterone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benevolence, belonging and the repression of white violence.</field><field name="creator">Riggs, Damien Wayne</field><field name="description">Research on racism in Australia by white psychologists is often fraught with tensions surrounding a) accounting for privilege, b) the depiction of particular racial minorities, and c) how individual acts of racism are understood. Nowhere is this more evident than in research that focuses on the relationship between Indigenous and white Australians. Such research, as this thesis will demonstrate, has at times failed to provide an account of the ongoing acts of racism that shape the discipline of psychology, and which thus inform how white psychologists in Australia write about Indigenous people. As a counter to this, I outline in this thesis an alternate approach to understanding racism in Australia, one that focuses on the ways in which racism is foundational to white subjectivities in Australia, and one that understands white violence against Indigenous people as an ongoing act. In order to explicate these points, and to examine what they mean in relation to white claims to belonging in Australia, I employ psychoanalytic concepts within a framework of critical psychology in order to develop an account of racism which, whilst drawing on the insights afforded by social constructionist approaches to racism and subjectivity, usefully extends such approaches in order to understand their import for examining racism in Australia. More specifically, I demonstrate how racism in Australia displays what Hook (2005) refers to as a 'psychic life of colonial power', one that implicates all people in histories of racism, and one that highlights the collective psychical nature of racism, rather than understanding it as an individual act. In the analyses that follow from this framework I demonstrate how white privilege and its corollary - the disavowal of Indigenous sovereignty - are warranted by white Australians. To do this, I engage in a textual analysis of empirical data, focusing on both the everyday talk of white Australians as gathered via focus groups and a speech by Prime Minister Howard. In particular, I highlight how claims by white Australians to 'doing good' for Indigenous people (what I refer to as 'benevolence') may in fact be seen to evidence one particular moment where the originary violence of colonisation is yet again played out in the name of the white nation. More specifically, and following Ahmed (2004), I suggest that claims to 'anti-racism' may be seen as 'non-performatives' - they do not require white Australians to actually challenge our unearned privilege, nor to examine how we are located within racialised networks of power. In contrast to this, I sketch out an approach to examining racism, both within the discipline of psychology and beyond, that is accountable for ongoing histories of colonial violence, which acknowledges the role that the discipline often continues to play in the legitimation of race, and which is willing to address the relationship that white Australians are already in with Indigenous Australians.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">racism, race awareness, race relations, whites, Aboriginal Australians, benevolence</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of orange spotting disorder in oil palm</field><field name="creator">Vadamalai, Ganesan</field><field name="description">Molecular hybridization of Northern blots of single (1D) and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) with a &#179;&#178; P-labelled full length CCCVd&#8322;  &#8324; &#8326;   cRNA probe demonstrated the presence of Coconut cadang - cadang viroid (CCCVd)-like RNAs in nucleic acid extracts of both symptomatic (orange spotted) and asymptomatic oil palms in commercial plantations in Malaysia. Compared with CCCVd in coconut these CCCVd-like RNAs seemed to be present at low concentration in the oil palm samples as shown by the weak hybridization signals observed in the oil palm samples even when large amounts of nucleic acid extract (leaf fresh weight equivalent of 20-100 g) were loaded onto the gel. Ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) was found to be more sensitive in detecting low concentrations of the CCCVd-like RNAs in the oil palm samples than Northern blots as shown by the higher percentage of positive samples. RPA showed that 90 % of the symptomatic and 50 % of asymptomatic palms from Malaysia had RNAs which protected the  &#179;&#178;P-labelled full length CCCVd antisense probe and produced a similar RPA pattern to that of CCCVd. RPA results also indicated that there were mismatches in the sequence of the CCCVd-like RNAs in the oil palms compared to CCCVd from coconut. RT-PCR amplification of CCCVd-like RNAs from an asymptomatic palm was only successful when nucleic acids were partially purified using 1D or 2D-PAGE. RNAs eluted from the circular region of 2D-gels of the asymptomatic palm were amplified to a low concentration using CCCVd-specific primers but re-amplification of these first round RT-PCR products was needed for detection of the amplicons by ethidium bromide staining. No amplified product was obtained from a symptomatic palm. Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR products from the asymptomatic oil palm produced 20 clones of five sizes comprising 297 nt (OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;), 293 nt (OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;), 270 nt (OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320;), 232 nt (OP&#8322;&#8323; &#8322;) and 165 nt (OP&#8321;&#8326;&#8325;). 71 % of the clones were OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;. Comparison of OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;, OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;, and OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320;  with genome database sequences showed high sequence similarity with CCCVd&#8322;&#8329;&#8326;. OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;. OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;, OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320; had 98 %, 97 % and 90 % sequence similarity with CCCVd&#8322;&#8329;&#8326; respectively. OP&#8322;&#8323;&#8322; and OP&#8321;&#8326;&#8325;  also had high sequence similarity with parts of CCCVd &#8322;&#8324;&#8326; with which they were aligned. Because an arbitrary level of 90 % sequence similarity is accepted as separating viroid species from variants, OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327; , OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323; and OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320;  can be considered as variants of CCCVd. No variants of the ' fast '  CCCVd &#8322; &#8324; &#8326; form were obtained. The consensus OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8327;  sequence had single base substitutions or additions at 5 sites, OP&#8322;&#8329;&#8323;  had substitutions, additions or deletions at 8 sites, and OP&#8322;&#8327;&#8320; had substitutions at 4 sites as well as deletion of a 26 nt repeat at the right terminus, producing a predicted branched secondary structure. Compared with CCCVd&#8322;&#8329;&#8326; , all variants substituted (C-U) at nt 31 in the pathogenicity domain and (A-C) at nt 175 in the right hand terminal domain. The presence of sequences similar to OP&#8322;&#8323;&#8322; and OP&#8321;&#8326;&#8325;  has not been reported for CCCVd. Analysis of DNA extracted from both symptomatic and asymptomatic oil palms from Malaysia by nested PCR using universal primers sets to amplify the 16S rRNA operon showed the presence of phytoplasma-like DNAs in both sets of samples. They were also detected in DNA extracted from oil palm seedlings maintained at the Waite campus but not in the other palm species maintained in the glasshouse. RFLP analysis of phytoplasma-like DNAs gave a different pattern than that expected for Australian grapevine yellows phytoplasma. The phytoplasma - like DNAs were also not related to lethal yellowing phytoplasma (LYp) as PCR analysis with LYp specific primers did not produce any amplicon. No association with OS was found and so they were not characterised further. CCCVd-infected coconut leaf collected in the Philippines contained two short interfering RNAs (siRNA) approximately 20 nt and 25 nt in size. A high stringency wash of the Northern blots failed to remove the hybridisation signal suggesting that these siRNAs had sequences closely similar to CCCVd. The siRNAs were present in all stages of the cadang-cadang and also samples with the 'brooming' symptom. siRNAs are regarded as a marker for post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants infected by viroids but the results obtained were insufficient to determine whether PTGS regulates the accumulation of CCCVd. This is the first report that a viroid closely related to CCCVd occurs in oil palm, and in a region outside the Philippines, the country where CCCVd is thought to be contained. The implications for quarantine matters are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant diseases, oil palm</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of long term oxygen therapy on South Australian patients with chronic lung disease.</field><field name="creator">Crockett, Alan Joseph</field><field name="description">The peer-reviewed publications contained within this thesis describe studies that have contributed significantly to the understanding of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) for Australian Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. My personal contribution to each of these studies ranged from the initial development of the hypotheses and design and execution of the investigations, submission of research grants applications to fund the studies through to preparation of the manuscripts for publication. When LTOT was first introduced into Australia I was fortunate to meet the key experts in LTOT including Professors Tom Petty, Nick Anthonisen, David Flenley, Pierre Levi-Valensi and Peter Howard. At that time all were involved in randomised controlled trials of oxygen therapy. (1, 2), 3). I also visited several oxygen concentrator and oxygen supply companies in the USA and UK. It was during these visits that I became convinced that the concentrator provided a more economical and efficient method of LTOT delivery. In 1980, an oxygen concentrator was imported to Australia by the spouse of one of our patients suffering from emphysema who was receiving long term oxygen via cylinders In 1982, two oxygen concentrators were donated to FMC by two different manufacturers (DeVilbis and Marx) based in the USA. These instruments were trialled on a male and female patient receiving LTOT in the Southern Adelaide metropolitan area. The initial acceptance of this device by these patients led to a submission to the South Australian Department of Health for a grant to purchase 40 units. Funds were finally obtained for the purchase of 34 concentrators by FMC and these were rolled out to the then existing patients who were receiving LTOT in 1984. Up to this point in time the only published guidelines or recommendations for LTOT came from the American College of Chest Physicians in 1973(3) and the American Thoracic Society in 1977(4). In 1982, the staff of the Respiratory Unit, FMC held a workshop where it was agreed that patients' would be assessed for home oxygen therapy using the 1977 American Thoracic Society Guideline. The late Professor Ann Woolcock presented a paper during a 1983 symposium titled "Long Term Oxygen Therapy: A World View" during a 1983 symposium held in Toronto, Canada where she estimated that at that time 2,100 patients were receiving oxygen in New South Wales for an average of 1 hour per day. She further reported that the use of cylinders ranged from 1 cylinder a year to 14 cylinders per week. Physicians were reported to have been conservative in their approach to oxygen therapy and that only 50 people were on long term oxygen therapy in New South Wales. Presumably the vast majority of these patients were receiving intermittent oxygen therapy. Woolcock mentioned that oxygen concentrators were available but provided no specific detail of their use in Australia(5). The first Australian guideline for the provision of domiciliary long-term oxygen therapy appeared in 1985. This guideline was developed at the request of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand. 6). In the same year I published my first paper relating to the provision of oxygen therapy via an oxygen concentrator based on our initial experiences with this technology(7). In the following year I published a paper documenting the analysis of the costs for providing home oxygen therapy. I also reported how Cost-Centre Management led to the introduction of practical measures for improved clinical decision making and improved expenditure control resulting in substantial cost savings(8). This publication led to a paper reporting the rationalization of the supply of home oxygen in the Hunter region of New South Wales.(9). This paper also reported the one to five year survival rates for their patients. At that time only between 5 and 12% of patients were receiving LTOT oxygen via an oxygen concentrator. At best, oxygen therapy is cumbersome with the patient 'tethered' to the oxygen source that, in the past, limited the movement of the patient due to the size and weight of the oxygen cylinders. Oxygen concentrators provided a partial answer to these problems. The introduction of this new technology led to ongoing evaluation of the impact on patient care and acceptance of the intervention and whether the expected outcomes increased survival and quality of life, were achieved(10). In 1991 I published the first detailed Australian data on survival for patients receiving home oxygen therapy. The results of this study indicated that the mortality rate for COPD with respiratory failure at 1 year was twice the rate reported by the Medical Research Council Working Party and the Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy multicentre trials. This was in spite of the baseline physiological parameters for our patients being similar to the patients in these benchmark studies. I was later able to show that survival of our long term oxygen patients was no better than the control group of the original MRC study(11-13).The second significant observation was that females survived longer than males(14). In 1992 a further paper was published and reported that in spite of strict prescription criteria and the introduction of a cost-saving new technology oxygen concentrators, the budget for this intervention remained under pressure. This was largely due to a rapidly increasing demand from eligible patients(10).A further analysis of the longitudinal data resulted in a report of an association between home oxygen therapy with a reduction in respiratory admissions and bed days(15). At this time there was a relative paucity of information about the trends of mortality in COPD in Australia. To further understand the burden of disease (COPD) and changing trends in mortality over time a research project was undertaken that indicating that the mortality of females from COPD was increasing whilst it was decreasing in males(16). The relatively poor survival outcomes for our home oxygen patients prompted further attempts to understand the costs and benefits in terms of quality of life and the evaluation of two generic health related quality of life questionnaires available at that time (1996). The results of the study suggested that the sole use of the SF-36 as a health outcome measure in COPD patients might fail to provide information about the mental domains of their quality of life. Decreased cognitive function, anxiety and depression were shown in Australian COPD patients(17). A series of papers published in Europe describing the observations made on Australian home oxygen patients were published between 1996 and 2000 at the request of the International Oxygen Club. The membership of this club included Professors Tom Petty, David Flenley, Pierre Levi-Valensi, Peter Howard, Heinrich Matthys and Roland Keller(11, 18, 19, 20 ). Further attempts to rationally allocate resources in the management of COPD in the acute care setting were reported in 1999 using Program Budgeting and Marginal Analysis. (21). I undertook a systematic Cochrane Review of the five randomized controlled trials of the use of home or long term oxygen therapy in COPD demonstrating that this intervention improved survival in a selected group of severely hypoxaemic COPD patients (22). However, this intervention does not appear to provide any benefit for patients with moderate hypoxaemia or nocturnal desaturation. (20) This review has been translated into several languages and is cited as the basis of many of the more recent guidelines regarding LTOT. More recently a NH&amp;MRC funded study report was published reviewing the impact of evidence based clinical practice concerning LTOT. This report resulted in several peer reviewed papers being published where we explored the relationship between the evidence and the observed outcomes in terms of both survival and quality of life(13, 23, 24). Finally, we conducted a study of the relative survival of our patients compared to those patients with similar characteristics in France. We demonstrated that our patients' relative survival was less than their French counterparts(25). At the time of publication this was only the second paper to be ever-published using relative survival analysis in COPD and the first in Australia. This difference is hard to explain by the level of severity, number of pack years or level of lung function impairment. Other possible factors contributing to the excess mortality in South Australian COPD patients need to be investigated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oxygen therapy, lungs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37767</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lateral distribution of Cerenkov light from extensive air showers</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Bruce Robert</field><field name="description">Investigations of the cosmic ray flux around the " knee " in the all - particle energy spectrum can provide information on the origin of this steepening. Studies of air shower development in this region are especially informative, although experiments in recent years have produced some conflicting results. Some report an unusually rapid development of showers, which has been interpreted in terms of an increased proportion of heavy nuclei in the flux, compared with the directly measured low energy composition. This thesis describes measurements of the lateral distribution of Cerenkov light associated with air showers with sea level sizes between ~ 10 ^ and 1O7 particles. It is shown that the slope of the lateral distribution is sensitive to air shower development and that the shape is in agreement with the results of recent calculations. These calculations are used to assign depths of maximum to the showers observed. A comprehensive simulation of the selection biases present in the experiment is used in the interpretation of the results on the depth of shower maximum. The data are shown to be consistent with a cosmic ray composition rich in iron in the energy region studied.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cherenkov radiation, cosmic ray showers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of dehydroperloline and of lactam antagonists of gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA )</field><field name="creator">Thach, Duong</field><field name="description">Part I of this thesis describes the synthesis of dehydro - perloline ( 3 ), a non basic material obtained from the degradation of the alkaloid perloline ( 1 ), the major alkaloid of New Zealand rye grass.

I grew the plants at different plant densities, under different levels of resources ( phosphorus and / or light ), in environments with homogeneous and / or patchy distribution of phosphorus ( P ). In pots with homogeneous distribution of P, the addition of P to R. chlorocephala and mycorrhizal infection in T. subterraneum increased plant biomass of single plants. However, these beneficial effects were reduced by increasing plant density. Shading of plants of T. subterraneum did not generally alter these effects. Mycorrhizal symbiosis and the addition of P always increased the intensity of plant intraspecific competition. In trays with patchy or homogeneous distribution of P, mycorrhizal infection and patchy distribution of P increased the total biomass and size inequality of populations of plants of T. subterraneum. Individual biomass was determined by the local soil P concentration in patchy environments and by mycorrhizal infection in low density treatments. Mycorrhizal infection, but not patchy P distribution, increased relative competition intensity. Asymmetric or symmetric distribution of resources between plants will change these size hierarchies. The distinction between these two types of distributions has lead to two different models explaining the interaction between competition and size inequality ( degree to which the biomass is concentrated within a small fraction of the population &amp;# 40 Weiner and Thomas 1986 ) ) the resource depletion and resource pre - emption models ( Weiner and Thomas 1986, Weiner 1988b ). In the first model ( resource depletion ) competition reduces the relative growth rate of all the individuals by the same proportion, reduces variance of growth rates and reduces variation in sizes. Thus, in this model resource acquisition is proportional to plant size ( Weiner 1990 ). This model is also called symmetric or two - sided competition and applies when competition for nutrients predominates. It predicts that at high density, plants will be smaller but the population will have less inequality than at low density ( Weiner and Thomas 1986 ). In the second model ( resource pre - emption ), competition increases the variation in relative growth rates and increases variation in sizes. Large plants obtain a more than proportional share of the resources ( relative to sizes ) ( Weiner 1990 ) and this increases their competitive ability which results in a positive feedback on plant size. This phenomenon is also called snowball cumulation, asymmetric or one - sided competition and it was observed only when competition for light was predominant ( Wilson 1988a ). This second model predicts that at high density plant populations will have more inequality than at low density ( Weiner and Thomas 1986 ). Although these two models are generally accepted, alternative analyses and recent experiments show that the degree of asymmetry of the interaction depends on the spatial and temporal distribution of the resource, the spatial distribution of the individuals in the population, neighbourhood competition and the mobility of the resource ( Huston 1986 ; Miller and Weiner 1989, Weiner 1990, Bonan 1991 ). Weiner ( 1990 ) suggested that if nutrients are distributed homogeneously and the uptake is proportional to root size, the competitive interaction will be more symmetric, whereas if patches with more nutrients can be reached by large individuals, asymmetric competition will predominate. This hypothesis has not been tested yet. Turner and Rabinowitz ( 1983 ) found that populations with an initial random spatial distribution of individuals had an unexpected increase in size inequality. My results emphasise that the main effects of mycorrhizas at the individual level cannot be expected to be apparent at the population level, because of the influence of density - dependent processes. However, infected individuals with a strong response to the symbiosis would have an advantage in situations of competition. This scenario can explain the maintenance of the symbiotic ability even under conditions such as dense populations, where there is no obvious advantage of the symbiosis at the population level.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">plant populations, mycorrhizas, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of deubiquitylating enzymes in cell-cell adhesion and development.</field><field name="creator">Millard, Susan</field><field name="description">Ubiquitylation is a versatile post-translational modification that participates in regulation of protein stability, via proteasomal and lysosomal degradative pathways, regulation of membrane protein internalisation and other trafficking events, and regulating the biological activity of some proteins independent of degradation. The diverse functions of ubiquitylation as a post- translational protein modification allow speculation that regulation of protein ubiquitylation status may be of crucial importance during the dynamic process of development. A screen of known, and suspected, ubiquitin pathway enzymes was designed to test this hypothesis. Whole mount in situ hybridisation was conducted on early post implantation mouse embryos to determine expression patterns of the ubiquitin pathway enzyme targets. This screen was not pursued in depth due to difficulties in resolving doubts regarding the sensitivity of the method and the validity of weak ubiquitous staining patterns. The FAM deubiquitylating enzyme is a known developmentally regulated ubiquitin pathway enzyme, and although believed to antagonise the conjugation of ubiquitin to specific substrates its cell biology remains poorly characterised. In different cellular contexts FAM has been reported to localise to points of cell-cell contact or to endosomes, and circumstantial evidence suggests a role in regulating trafficking of a cell-cell adhesion complex (Murray et al., 2004; Taya et al., 1999; Taya et al., 1998). It was sought to further investigate the role of FAM in cell-cell adhesion in the well characterized polarized epithelial cell line, MDCKII, by creating clonal MDCKII cell lines that overexpress FAM. These cell lines were to be analysed for alterations in cell-cell adhesive properties and the biochemistry of proposed FAM substrates, which include the cell adhesion molecules &#946;-catenin, E-cadherin and AF-6. MDCKII cell lines expressing exogenous V5-tagged murine FAM were successfully isolated, but failed to show changes in cell-cell adhesive properties. Generation of an antibody that reliably recognised both the canine and murine FAM protein demonstrated that the FAM-V5 expressing cell lines did not have increased total FAM protein. Other approaches taken to facilitate the study of FAM include attempts to express GFP-FAM fusion proteins and to generate an inducible FAM overexpressing cell line. Further alternative approaches are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cell adhesion, ubiquitin</field><field name="subject">Cell adhesion</field><field name="subject">Ubiquitin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the environmental impact statement under the South Australian Planning Act from 1982 - 1993</field><field name="creator">Harvey, Nicholas</field><field name="description">After more than a decade of environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) provisions within South Australian Planning Act, 1982 it is appropriate to examine the role of the environmental impact statement ( EIS ) as a major element of EIA and an important decision making tool for major projects over this period. The thesis first provides a review of EIA from its overseas origins to its development at the Commonwealth level in Australia. This provides the context within which to examine the system of EIA for major developments or projects in South Australia, which are dealt with largely through the EIS process. The thesis examines the type of projects which, according to the discretionary criteria in the Planning Act, have attracted EIS requirements between 1982 - 1993 and uses this to determine generic groupings of projects. It is noted that marinas represent the largest group of projects with EIS requirements, although EISs have been called for power generation related projects, electricity transmission line projects, tourist related projects, industrial projects, mining projects, water management projects, transport projects and a number of other projects. The thesis examines the number of EISs that have been completed, whether or not the projects have been approved or rejected and to what extent any patterns have emerged. The thesis then focuses on all the completed EISs in terms of their content, timing of preparation, public involvement and response, associated legislative requirements, type and role of developer, type and role of EIS consultant, the assessment of the EIS, and the decision making process. The thesis notes the high approval rate for projects with completed EISs suggesting most of the environmental problems have been resolved or are capable of being resolved. It is also noted that a number of projects are abandoned before the EIS is ever completed and that the few rejected EIS proposals are associated with high numbers of public submissions. Although each of the rejected proposals has a complex history of project development, environmental assessment and negotiations, it is noted that the decision to reject the proposals was ultimately a political decision. The thesis comments on the limited role of the South Australian Planning Commission ( SAPC ) in EIS project decision making in South Australia and the increasing use of the Governor as a decision maker. Although the SAPC is the statutory planning authority it is constrained by having to have regard to the principles in the Development Plan which is geared toward development control rather than for the extraordinary major projects which become subject to EIS requirements. The thesis then examines proposed changes to EIA in the context of early attempts to initiate EIA reform in South Australia through to the current Development Bill. These proposals are placed in context with changes to EIA procedures that have taken place at the Commonwealth level, the proposed development of a national agreement on EIA, and also the implications for EIA which are likely to flow from recent Commonwealth initiatives on ecologically sustainable development strategies. In addition the implications of recently developed environment protection agencies and associated legislation are examined at both the State and Commonwealth levels. Collectively these reviews and analyses provide the context of current thinking on EIA as it is likely to affect South Australian EIA processes in the future. Finally the thesis discusses the evolving role of the South Australian EIS in the context of its evolutionary process and the proposed legislative changes in South Australia, together with other related initiatives. This discussion touches on a number of issues such as public administration, the actual practice of the EIA process as opposed to the theory of EIA and what is written into the EIA legislation. In conclusion an overview is given of the current role of the EIS with some predictions for the future of EIA in South Australia.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental impact analysis South Australia, environmental policy South Australia, environmental impact statements South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the pathogenesis of Hepadnavirus infection</field><field name="creator">Jilbert, Allison Rae</field><field name="description">Improved methods for the in situ hybridisation detection of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) in sections of liver tissue, were derived by use of an experimental system. This involved the use of tritiated-poly ( dT ) probes to detect poly ( A ) sequences attached to the 3 ' end of mRNA in sections of mouse liver that had been processed in various ways. The improved - methods were applied to the detection of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) - and hepatitis delta virus ( HDV ) - RNA. In situ hybridisation and immunostaining techniques were then applied to studies of the pathogenesis of HBV and duck hepatitis B virus ( DHBV ) infection. In situ hybridisation studies of liver biopsy tissue from HBV - infected immunosuppressed renal transplant patients demonstrated an anatomical association between piecemeal necrosis and HBV replication at the cellular level in some patients. However, widespread replicative infection of hepatocytes also occurred in some patients in the presence of normal hepatocyte morphology and mild inflammatory changes indicating that at the cellular level virus replication was not necessarily a direct cytopathic process. These findings supported the view that hepatocyte Injury may : ( i ) result from immune - mediated damage directed against cells undergoing replicative, but not restricted infection ; ( ii ) eliminate cells undergoing replicative infection and favour clonal regeneration of cells undergoing restricted infection. Localisation of interferon - alpha ( IFN - alpha ) expression in liver tissue chronically infected with HBV and HDV, identified mononuclear cells and fibroblasts ( but not hepatocytes ) as the main producers of IFN - alpha. IFN - alpha - positive cells were associated with areas of liver tissue containing cells supporting virus replication and exhibiting the greatest degree of liver damage, suggesting that locally produced IFN - alpha may be a natural regulator of virus replication in chronic liver disease. Experimental DHBV infection of Pekin - Aylesbury ducks showed that virus inoculated either intravenously or intraperitoneally, gained access to randomly distributed hepatocytes without first replicating in other cell types in the liver. Virus was seen to disseminate to contiguous cells following anatomical boundaries by the third day post - inoculation. Markers of DHBV infection in liver and serum showed reproducible kinetics, and duck hepatocytes in this system appeared to be highly permissive as large amounts of DHBV DNA and DHBsAg were produced intracellularly without the development of ongoing cytopathology. Hepatocytes were the major cell type responsible for early significant DHBV replication, in contrast to pancreas, kidney, spleen and circulating mononuclear cells where significant levels of infection were detected only after the first week of infection and the onset of viraemia.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hepatitis, viral pathogenesis, hepatitis viruses, hepatitis B virus</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37777</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The upper Brachina subgroup : a late Precambrian intertidal deltaic and sandflat sequence in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Plummer, Phillip Sydney</field><field name="description">The stratigraphy of the late Precarnbrian upper Brachina Subgroup has been studied in detail throughout the southern and central Flinders Ranges of South Australia. Ten stratigraphically significant facies associations are readily recognisable within which 18 separate and distinct lithotypes have been defined and described. The complex regional strati - graphic arrangement has been simplified by using a Markov Chain technique of analysis. The resultant lithotype stratigraphy is used as the base upon which the palaeogeographic history of the upper Brachina Subgroup is reconstructed. A detailed sedimentologic analysis of each lithotype was undertaken in order to ascertain their individual palaeoenvironments of deposition. This involved a petrologic analysis of the arenaceous component of each lithotype, the analysis of the suite of sedimentary structures contained within each lithotype, and the analysis of all directional structures for palaeocurrent directions. For this latter analysis a new computer technique was developed whereby up to 3 individual populations can be separately analysed from any one distribution. Deposition of the upper Brachina Subgroup succession was due to a phase of uplift tectonism and minor accompanying basic volcanism. Within this succession two distinct depositional episodes are readily discernable. During the first episode a massive sand influx flowed from a westerly source region ( the Gawler Craton ) into a shallow submerged, though possibly tidally influenced mudflat as a prograding deltaic succession ( the " Alligator River Delta " ). This initial delta developed in the western region of the Adelaide ' Geosyncline ' as a fluvial and tide modified, wave dominated system which was fed by stable outlet channels, protected by barrier - bars and surrounded by a low intertidal aerobic mudflat. Preserved wi - bhin this mudflat deposit are the probable body fossils of primitive cup - shaped coelenterates ( ? ), which were possibly the ancestral organisms of the Ediacara assemblage. With, continued sediment influx and basin shallowing, this initial delta system evolved to an unbarred fluvial modified, tide - dominated delta which was fed by migrating channels and surrounded by an intertidal mudflat. This mudflat was anaerobic, possibly due to the activity of abundant microscopic organisms. The second depositional episode of the upper Brachina Subgroup developed when tectonic instability affected a portion of the basin's western margin ( Uplift I ). As a result, part of the previously deposited deltaic succession was eroded and reworked into a vast, thin intertidal sandflat which extended through the central region, and into the northern region of the Adelaide ' Geosyncline '. A second phase of tectonic instability ( Uplift II ) caused renewed activity along the basin ' s western margin, and also induced the emergence of at least two islands within the basin. Around these islands a thin, dominantly fluvial deposit was generated. The final phase of tectonic instability ( Uplift III ) affected only the western margin of the basin, and produced a narrow sand deposit of probable beach origin. Meanwhile, within the basin gradual subsidence induced the development of a shallow, possibly tidal aerobic mudflat and marked the end of the upper Brachina Subgroup phase of sedimentation.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology stratigraphic precambrian, palaeogeography South Australia Flinders Ranges, sediments (geography) South Australia Flinders Ranges</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biostratigraphy and palaeoecology of South Australian Precambrian stromatolites</field><field name="creator">Preiss, Wolfgang Victor</field><field name="description">Precambrian stromatolites in South Australia are almost entirely restricted to the folded rock sequence of the Adelaide Geosyncline, a large, deeply subsiding basin with predominantly shallow - water sediments. The history of research into the age and fossils of the Precambrian rocks is reviewed, and a possible time - framework is suggested on the basis of available radiometric data. Stromatolites, laminated structures formed by trapping of detritus and precipitation of chemical sediment by algae and bacteria, have been studied by other workers from at least two points of views : most Western authors regard stromatolite morphology to be purely environmentally determined, while one Russian school maintains that it is largely controlled by the algae present, and that stromatolites evolve as a consequence of the evolution of the algae forming them. They concluded this from an empirical study of widespread stromatolites of different ages, which made possible the biostratigraphic subdivision and correlation of many Late Precambrian sections. The Russian methods of study and taxonomy have now been applied to South Australian stromatolites for the first time. Of the eighteen forms of columnar stromatolites described, five are identical or nearly identical to Russian forms. Nine forms are new, but sufficiently similar to Russia forms to allow inclusion in the same groups as these. Groups and forms must be defined on the basis of numerous characters, which may be given different relative weighting for different taxa. The taxa so defined have restricted ranges in geological time. Stromatolite correlation with the Russian sequence suggests that the Early Adelaidean ( i.e. pre - tillite ) beds are middle Riphean ; the Skillogalee Dolomite is youngest middle Riphean, i.e. older than the Late Riphean Bitter Springs Formation of Central Australia. The Late Adelaidean Umberatana Group assemblage, correlated with the youngest Late Riphean, has seven groups in common with the Bitter Springs Formation, but unlike the latter, it overlies the lower tillite. A comparison with available radiometric data shouts good agreement for the Umberatana Group, but some conflict with one recent age determination exists for the Early Adelaidean. A study of the environments of growth of South Australian stromatolites shows that at least three forms, of widespread distribution, grew under a variety of conditions of energy, oxidation, type of sediment influx, and possibly salinity. The taxa defined are stable under these varying conditions, but there are minor modifications due to differences in environmental energy. Skillogalee Dolomite stromatolites grew under varying energy conditions on a very extensive and level carbonate depositing platform, frequently under hypersaline conditions. Umberatana Group stromatolites inhabited a marine environment, either in marginal littoral zones in the south - western and north - eastern Flinders Ranges, or on off - shore carbonate banks interpreted to be related to rising diapirs. In both cases, stromatolites formed during episodes of shallowing water depth.</field><field name="date">1971</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stromatolites, geology, stratigraphic precambrian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37781</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chicken histone H5 mRNA and its genes</field><field name="creator">Scott, Andrew Charles</field><field name="description">1. The work described in this thesis forms part of an investigation of eukaryotic gene control. The system studied was the avian erythroid cell series since it is possible to isolate pure populations of the various cell types which have well-defined biochemical activities. These cells contain an unusual tissue - specific histone H5, which may be involved in the progressive repression of transcription observed as these cells differentiate. Although the gene controlling function of this histone must be at a very gross level, this represents a unique opportunity to investigate one facet of gene control. Probably the most sensitive technique is to assay for specific messenger RNA and gene sequences by hybridisation to an appropriate probe. The aim of this thesis was to prepare such a probe from H5 mRNA and to use it to calculate the reiteration frequency of the H5 gene in the chicken genome. 2. The cells employed were chicken reticulocytes since the only histone made in these cells is H5. Experiments were conducted which demonstrated that H5 mRNA is probably a minor species compared to globin mRNA in these cells. Furthermore, calculations indicate that the two mRNAs are probably of similar molecular weight which may complicate the isolation of H5 mRNA. As a result globin mRNA was first purified and characterised. Properties which may have proved useful in the separation of this mRNA from H5 mRNA are discussed. The globin mRNA was used to optimise techniques for the in vitro translation and identification of chicken mRNAs. This was considered necessary as mRNAs from different sources vary in the conditions required for optimal translation and it was reasoned that mRNAs from the same cell would have similar optima. 3. Total polysomal RNA was fractionated on the basis of size and poly A content. Although large amounts of globin mRNA were present, H5 mRNA could only be detected in the non - poly A containing RNA. Even in this fraction however, there was still a large excess of globin mRNA which was difficult to remove due to the demonstrated similarity of their molecular weights. 4. Since it had proved impossible to isolate the H5 mRNA by conventional techniques, immunological methods of isolating the polysomes producing H5 were investigated. Using immunoadsorbents, mRNA was prepared in small amounts which programmed the synthesis in vitro of more than 70 % H5. The yield and specificity were improved by modifying the procedure to indirect immunoprecipitation followed by oligo ( dT ) - cellulose chromatography. The resulting mRNA programmes the synthesis in vitro of more than 90 % H5. The chemical purity of the mRNA is discussed. 5. The immunologically prepared H5 mRNA was not copied into cDNA by RNA - dependent DNA - polymerase. Since this was probably due to the lack of a 3 ' poly A tract on the mRNA, an enzyme was purified and characterised which would add such a tract. The enzymically modified mRNA could then be copied into cDNA of high specific activity. 6. The H5 cDNA was characterised in terms of size and fidelity of copying. By hybridisation analysis it was demonstrated that the amount of contaminating rRNA and globin mRNA complementary sequences present in the cDNA was insignificant. The complexity of the cDNA was shown to be of the same size as the H5 mRNA and will back hybridise to this mRNA to greater than 75 %. These results are discussed to demonstrate that the cDNA is a faithful copy of H5 mRNA. The possible uses of the resulting probe are also discussed. 7. The H5 cDNA was employed to quantify the number of H5 genes in the chicken genome. The significance of this result is discussed in terms of the known reiteration and organisation of histone genes in other species, and the possible role of H5 as a gene control agent.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ribonucleic acid, messenger, histones, immunoadsorption, erythrocytes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37782</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tidal and thermal propagation in the Port River estuary</field><field name="creator">Teubner, Michael David</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the problem of tidal and thermal propagation of water within a shallow estuary, with specific reference to the Port River Estuary in South Australia. A system of two - dimensional laterally integrated equations are obtained from the general three - dimensional equations of continuity, momentum conservation and thermodynamics by integration over the width of the estuarial channel, and this system is further integrated over depth to obtain a set of one-dimensional equations. A numerical model is developed from these equations, using explicit finite differences to approximate the tidal equations ( continuity and motion ) and implicit differences to model the temperature equation. The model is extended to include a number of interconnecting channels, and discusses boundary conditions to determine transports, elevations and temperatu along each of the channels. Verification of the numerical model is achieved by comparing results obtained from the model with analytic solutions for similar situations. These comparisons show good agreement between the two solutions. A two - dimensional numerical model is obtained by first non - dimensionalizing the laterally integrated equations with respect to the depth coordinate, and then using explicit finite differences to solve the equations of continuity, motion and temperature. Different schemes are considered in order to provide the best means of approximating the differential equations, and these are discussed with reference to stability, convergence and efficiency. The two models are applied to the Port River Estuary, where the Torrens Island Power Station pumps heated water into one of the channels within the estuary. Tidal elevations obtained from the models compare favourably with data collected at various points in the estuary. Unfortunately, no transport or temperature measurements are available to verify the models, but results obtained from both models are consistent. The temperature results tend to suggest that recirculation of heated water from the outflow region to the point where water is drawn into the Power Station does occur at most stages of a tidal cycle. This recirculation can lower the efficiency of the power station, and possible alternatives are put forward to prevent this becoming an economical problem for the Station.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tides mathematical models, Port River estuary South Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sedimentology of the late Precambrian Mundallio Subgroup : a clastic - carbonate ( Dolomite, Magnesite ) sequence in the Mt. Lofty and Flinders Ranges, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Uppill, Robin K</field><field name="description">During deposition of the mixed carbonate - clastic sequence of the Mundallio Subgroup, the " Adelaide Geosyncline " was a very shallow, elongate sedimentary basin, flanked to the west and east by older Precambrian basement. In much of the southern and northern Flinders Ranges, clastic deposition predominated in the lower Mundallio Subgroup. In the north, alternating development of shallow mudflats and sandflats ( Nankabunyana Formation ) depended on the interplay between the sediment supply and winnowing processes, while dolomite mudstones were locally deposited in the shallowest areas. In the eastern half of the Willouran Ranges, massive shales were deposited as the environment remained persistently below wave base ( Camel Flat Shale ), but a renewed sand influx led to deposition of the Tilterana Sandstone. In the southern Flinders Ranges, terrigenous clay and silt were deposited on submergent mudflats which shallowed into intermittently exposed dolomite mudflats ( Nathaltee Formation ). Dolomite mudflats were a more persistent feature in areas more distal from the terrigenous source, and sometimes contained isolated, ephemeral lakes which were sites of magnesite deposition ( Yadlamalka Formation ). Dolomite and magnesite mudstone deposition of the Yadlamalka Formation became wide spread in the northern and southern Flinders Ranges in the upper Mundallio Subgroup, as shallowing and retreat of the basin margin led to the formation of semi - isolated lakes, separated and enclosed by exposed carbonate mudflats. The elastics deposited in association with these carbonate mudstones consisted largely of sand sized detritus, probably derived from the reworking of aeolian deposits. In the eastern Willouran Ranges, the greater influx of sand and the slightly deeper, largely submergent environments, led to the deposition of the sandstones, dolomites and siltstones of the Mirra Formation. Because of little clastic influx into the northern Mt. Lofty Ranges, shallow to occasionally exposed environments were largely sites of dolomite deposition ( Skillogalee Dolomite ). To the south, shales were deposited in slightly deeper environments ( Woolshed Flat Shale ), although local dolomite deposition occurred in the Adelaide region ( Castambul Formation, Montacute Dolomite ). In the uppermost part of the subgroup, the area of shale deposition extended northward, encroaching over the dolomite mudflats of the upper Skillogalee Dolomite. Dolomite, occurring largely as mudstones, is the major carbonate mineral present in the Mundallio Subgroup, but magnesite is also widespread. Limestones are not present. The carbonates experienced minor replacement by early diagenetic chert, initially precipitated as both crystalline and amorphous phases. Within the upper Mundallio Subgroup, the preservation of fine details of the detrital texture of dolomite mudstones and peloidal dolomites, and the high Sr contents of dolomites ( largely in the range of 400 - 650 ppm ), suggest that these sediments consisted of Ca - Mg carbonates ( protodolomite, Mg - calcite ) at the time of deposition. Slightly greater recrystallisation of dolomites in the lower Mundallio Subgroup resulted in their lower Sr and higher Mn and Fe contents. Magnesite mudstones may have initially precipitated as hydrated Mg - carbonates. Lithification of surface sediments as a result of subaerial exposure, led to the formation of micritic magnesite. Much of this magnesite was subsequently reworked into intraclastic beds. The carbonate mineralogy of this sequence, and the evidence of only rare sulphates, indicate that the carbonates were precipitated from alkaline, Mg - Ca - C03 waters, with a higher carbonate and lower sulphate content than seawater.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology structural South Australia Mount Lofty Ranges, paleontology , geology stratigraphic precambrian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Very Viscous Flows Driven by Gravity with particular application to Slumping of Molten Glass</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Yvonne Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the flow of very viscous Newtonian fluids driven by gravity.

The Stokes creeping-flow equations are used to model the very viscous flows of interest. The main solution method is finite elements, and a purpose-written computer program has been developed to solve the creeping-flow equations by this method. The present program is restricted to solving for either two-dimensional or axisymmetric flows but is extendible to three dimensions. In addition, semi-analytic series and asymptotic methods are used for some small portions of the work. The optical applications of this work demand consideration of the topic of computing surface curvature, and therefore second derivatives, from inexact and discrete numerical and experimental data. For this purpose, fitting of B-splines by a least-squares method to coordinate data defining the surface has been used.  Much of the work assumes isothermal conditions, but in the context of the accuracy required in optical component manufacture it is also possible that non-isothermal effects will be important. Consequently, this restriction is eventually relaxed and some consideration given to non-isothermal conditions.  In order to validate the creeping-flow model and finite-element program, comparisons of numerical simulations with experimental results are performed. A preliminary assessment of the importance of non-isothermal conditions to the thermal-replication process is also made by comparing isothermal and non-isothermal simulations with experimental results. The isothermal model is found to best match the experimental data.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">viscous flow mathematical models, molten glass</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Departure processes from MAP/PH/1 queues</field><field name="creator">Green, David Anthony</field><field name="description">A MAP/PH/1 queue is a queue having a Markov arrival process (MAP), and a single server with phase-type (PH -type) distributed service time. This thesis considers the departure process from these type of queues. We use matrix analytic methods, the Jordan canonical form of matrices, non-linear filtering and approximation techniques. The departure process of a queue is important in the analysis of networks of queues, as it may be the arrival process to another queue in the network. If a simple description were to exist for a departure process, the analysis of at least feed-forward networks of these queues would then be analytically tractable. Chapter 1 is an introduction to some of the literature and ideas surrounding the departure process from MAP/PH/1 queues. Chapter 2 sets up the basic notation and establishes some results which are used throughout the thesis. It contains a preliminary consideration of PH -type distributions, PH -renewal processes, MAP s, MAP/PH/1 queues, non-linear filtering and the Jordan canonical form. Chapter 3 is an expansion of "The Output process of an MMPP/M/1 queue", where the question of whether a MAP description can exist for the departure process of a non-trivial MAP/M/1 queue is considered. In a 1994 paper, Olivier and Walrand conjectured that the departure process of a MAP/PH/1 queue is not a MAP unless the queue is a stationary M/M/1 queue. This conjecture was prompted by their claim that the departure process of an MMPP/M/1 queue is not MAP unless the queue is a stationary M/M/1 queue. We show that their proof has an algebraic error, which leaves open the above question of whether the departure process of an MMPP/PH/1 queue is a MAP or not. In Chapter 4, the more fundamental problem of identifying stationary M/M/1 queues in the class of MAP/PH/1 queues is considered. It is essential to be able to determine from its generator when a stationary MAP is a Poisson process. This does not appear to have been discussed in the literature prior to the author's paper, where this deficiency was remedied using ideas from non-linear filtering theory, to give a characterisation as to when a stationary MAP is a Poisson process. Chapter 4 expands upon "When is a MAP Poisson". This investigation of higher order representations of the Poisson process is motivated by first considering when a higher order PH -type distribution is just negative exponential. In Chapter 5, we consider the related question of minimal order representations for PH -type distributions, an issue which has attracted much interest in the literature. A discussion of other authors' ideas is given and these ideas are then inter-related to the work presented in Chapter 4 on the PH -type distributions. The MAP/M/1 queue is then considered in Chapter 6 from the perspective of whether having an exact level and phase independent stationary distribution of the geometric form  [Formula - Not available: see pdf version of the abstract] implies that the MAP is Poisson. The answer is in the affirmative for this question, but the converse is not strictly true. Apart from showing the ubiquitous asymptotic form of level and phase independence exhibited by all stable MAP/M/1 queues, we prove that a very large class of stable queues, exhibits what we have termed shift-one level and phase independence. Stable MAP/M/1 queues exhibiting shift-one level and phase independence, are characterised by a stationary distribution of the following form:  [Formula - Not Available: see pdf version of the abstract] In Chapter 7, a family of approximations is proposed for the output process of a stationary MAP/PH/1 queue. To check the viability of these approximations, they are used as input to another single server queue. Performance measures for the second server are obtained analytically in both the tandem and approximation cases, thus eliminating the need for simulation to compare results. Comparison of these approximations is also made against other approximation methods in the literature. In Chapter 8, we show that our approximations from Chapter 7 have the property of exactly matching the inter-departure time distribution. Our kth approximation also accurately captures the first k-1 lag-correlation coefficients of the stationary departure process. The proofs of this direct association between lag-correlation coefficients and the level of complexity k are given.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MAP/PH/1 queue, PH-type distribution, Markov arrival process (MAP), departure process, single server queue</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The toxicity of Vicia species and their utilisation as grain legumes</field><field name="creator">Enneking, Dirk</field><field name="description">The worldwide utilisation of Vicia species as forage and green manure crops is well established. Except for V. faba L., the utilisation of Vicia species as grain legumes is of minor global economic importance and mainly restricted to the Mediterranean region and South - West Asia, where the grain is used primarily as seed and in ruminant diets. In Australia, the comparatively high seed yields and low production costs for genotypes from species such as V. narbonensis L. (narbon bean or moor's pea) and V. sativa L. (common vetch) have provided an attractive alternative grain legume option for dryland farming and have thus stimulated an interest in markets for the grain. Monogastric animals (incl. humans) are the major global end-users for grain legume products. Because of the well known toxicity of Vicia spp. seeds to mono gastric animals in particular, this thesis has focused on those major toxic chemical seed components which are perceived as major constraints to the wider utilisation of these promising crops as grain legumes. A thorough examination of current and past practices of vetch cultivation and utilisation was undertaken to complement this approach. The two major aims were, first to elucidate the nature of the factors responsible for the low palatability of carbon beans to pigs, and second to review the available information about the toxicity of Vicia species and their utilisation as grain legumes. The potent feed inhibitory activity of Namoi vetch (V. villosa Roth cv. Namoi) provided a useful model for the initial age of this study. Its antifeedant activity was shown to he due to the toxic amino acid canavanine. Inclusion of canavanine in pig diets at a concentration equivalent to that found in Namoi vetch seed accounted fully for the feed inhibitory activity of this legume. The novel effect of this well known arginine analogue may well be explicable in terms of the inhibition of the argmine pathway leading to nitric oxide which is now known to be involved in the control of peristalsis. The experience gained with Namoi vetch in the feed-intake bioassay proved to be invaluable for the isolation of the much less potent y- glutamyl-S-ethenyl-cysteine feed inhibitor from the narbon bean. A quantitative assessment of this factor's feed inhibitory activity was not permitted due to the untimely death of our veterinary colleague, Dr. Richard Davies. There is, however, a clear correlation between the total S-ethenyl cysteine content of the tested diets and the negative porcine feed intake responses. An important difference between V. villosa and V. narbonensis was noted, as demonstrated by the rate at which the pigs reduced their feed intake. It is remarkable, that the effect of canavanine - containing diets becomes evident only after the second meal, whereas the pigs immediately restrict their feed intake when presented with diets containing S-ethenyl-cysteine. Such a clear delineation of feed-intake responses provides a simple and general classification for feed-intake inhibitors, and may be worthy of further detailed physiological studies. The antifeedant effects of these compounds suggest that they have evolved as part of the plants' anti-predator defence strategy. Particular attention, including a detailed review of its economic botany, has been given to V. narbonensis, a relatively unknown but promising grain crop for Australia. With the chemical identity of the unpalatability established, the selection of more palatable genotypes is likely to provide access for the grain to monogastric feed markets. The historical evidence suggests that V. narbonensis is a niche crop of particular value for specific agricultural applications, its conversion into a broad acre crop is a challenge for the future. V. sativa was investigated as a direct consequence of a request to chemically examine the toxin content of the cultivar Blanche Fleur. By the time that investigation commenced, Blanche Fleur, which was originally introduced to Australia as a hay, forage and green manure crop, had already been prematurely promoted and exported as a cheap replacement for red lentils (Lens culinaris Med.) in ignorance of this species' well documented content of y- glutamyl-&#946;-cyanoalanine and the favism toxin, vicine. A 1992 commentary article to Nature on our observations led to a ban on its importation by India and Egypt. Subsequent poultry bioassays established that the cyano- alanine content was substantially altered by cooking to produce some as yet un-identified nitrile component, but the feed inhibitory activity of the cooked grain was undiminished. Acid hydrolysis of Blanche Fleur, however, removed both, the readily detectable nitrile absorbance as well as the poultry feed-intake inhibition. This observation could potentially form the basis for a simple post-harvest detoxification process for V. sativa and other feed stuffs containing acid labile antinutritive factors. Unfortunately, cases of poisoning by Vicia species continue to be reported. These can be grouped into those caused by V. sativa and its related species (cyanogenic glycoside Vicianine: HCN poisoning; and anti- nutritional effects of (&#946;- cyanoalanine )and those caused by canavanine containing species ( V. villosa, V. benghalensis, V. ervilia etc.). Farmers need to be made aware of the well documented biochemical distinctions between Vicia cultivars to prevent the accidental intoxication of their livestock with seeds containing high concentrations of canavanine orvicianine. Finally, an overview of the voluminous and widely dispersed vetch literature, coupled with the observations in this thesis, suggest that the utility and value of each of the three Vicia model species examined in this thesis can be markedly enhanced by the following strategies : 1. Provision of sufficient alternative feed sources to allow feed intake to be regulated by palatability, thus rninirnising toxin ingestion. 2. Adaptation to Vicia toxins a) through selection of a digestive flora capable of detoxification (in the case of ruminants) and b) through selection or modification of animal genotypes with improved biochemical tolerance or even resistance to toxicity. 3. Detoxification prior to ingestion (Post - harvest detoxification) 4. Plant selection or genetic modification of specific toxin biosynthetic pathways to provide cultivars with optimum toxin concentration and distribution in strategic tissues (minimisation of toxins in the end product). The inevitable conclusion from this thesis is that by incrementing our current fundamental knowledge of the biological chemistry of their naturally occurring anti-predator metabolites, we will promote the intelligent usage of Vicia species as highly nutritious grains for a sustainable agriculture.

Keswick Clay is locally significant since many of Adelaide's multi-storey buildings are founded directly on it, and internationally significant, since it has been shown by Cox (1970), that this clay exhibits remarkably similar properties to those of the well-documented London Clay. The assessment of the small-scale variability of the undrained shear strength of these clays is based on measurements obtained using the electrical cone penetration test (CPT), and a micro-computer based data acquisition system, designed specifically for this study. A significant feature of the data acquisition system is that it enables measurements to be obtained at intervals of 5 mm, both reliably and efficiently. The development of the data acquisition system is discussed, and the accuracy of its measurements is examined. The small-scale variability of the undrained shear strength of the Keswick Clay is based on more than 200 vertical CPTs, performed within an area of 50 X 50 metres at a site located in the Adelaide city area. The CPTs were spaced at lateral intervals varying between 0.5 and 5 metres, with each vertical CPT extending to a typical depth of 5 metres. In addition, the small-scale horizontal spatial variability of the Keswick Clay is examined using an electrical cone penetrometer driven horizontally into the face of an embankment, again located within the Adelaide city area. The accuracy of the CPT measurements is examined, and discussion is given of the shortcomings associated with a commonly used technique, by Baecher (1982), for estimating the random measurement error associated with various test procedures. The assessment of the large-scale spatial variability of the undrained shear strength of the Keswick and Hindmarsh Clays is founded on a data base of geotechnical engineering properties, compiled from a number of consulting engineering practices and government instrumentalities. The data base, known as KESWICK, contains approximately 160 site investigations, 380 boreholes, and 10,140 measurements obtained from a number of different laboratory and in situ tests. In addition, KESWICK is used to establish generalised trends and bounds, associated with the various geotechnical engineering design properties contained within the data base. The techniques of random field theory and geostatistics are used to quantify, model and predict the spatial variability of the Keswick and Hindmarsh Clays. These techniques are compared with one another in order to assess the suitability and shortcomings of each, when applied to the study of the spatial variability of geotechnical engineering materials. Furthermore, a number of specifically-written computer programs, which were developed to enable the various spatial variability analyses to be performed, are discussed. It is demonstrated that the lateral undrained shear strength of the Keswick Clay, within the Adelaide city area, exhibits a nested structure; that is, one which is the compound effect of several genetic sources of spatial variation. In addition, it is shown that this nested structure can be adequately modelled by means of a spherical semivariogram model. The nested structure is used, together with the kriging estimation process, to provide preliminary estimates of the undrained shear strength of the Keswick Clay, within the Adelaide city area. The analyses demonstrate that the nested model and the kriging process provide a useful facility for generating preliminary estimates of the strength of the clay. Finally, the significance of the spatial variability of the undrained shear strength of clay soils is examined, with reference to the design of embankments and pile foundations. It is demonstrated that the correlation distance can greatly influence the design of each of these geotechnical systems.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clay soils, soil mechanics, engineering geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">University enrolment planning</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Leith Huybers</field><field name="description">At the University of Adelaide, the total number of students enrolled in any course is controlled by quotas on the number of new entrants to the course each year. A linear relationship is used to forecast total enrolment given the number of new students in each previous year ; for future years, the number of new students is taken to be the size of the quota. Chapter 1 relates the methods in use at the University of Adelaide to the work of other authors and demonstrates how a Markov model may be used to obtain the lifetimes of students in a particular course, namely the Ph.D. degree course. Chapter 2 then develops a linear programming model which mimicks the forecasting method already in use and which determines the intake quotas over a period of years that use as much as possible of the course capacity while satisfying certain constraints. These constraints en - sure that the total enrolment each year is no greater than the capacity in that year and that the intakes are non - decreasing and no greater than some maximum value. In particular, the programme is designed to be used to determine strategies which move the course into a constant enrolment, or non - growth, period while accounting for restrictions on the permissible rate of growth. It is shown that the special structure of the problem may be exploited to find a particular solution which is optimal for several, commonly encountered objective functions. The requirement that the intakes should be integral is discussed and is shown to pose very little additional difficulty. An example from the University of Adelaide is used to illustrate the methods. Chapter 3 considers extensions of the basic model ( the single - grade, single - course case ) to situations where there are several grades within a course with capacities on some of these grades or where several inter - related courses are to be planned at the same time. Finally, chapter 4 contains a discussion of the applicability of the work of the thesis and suggests possibilities for further extensions.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education, higher education admissions, higher education enrolment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape quality assessment of South Australia</field><field name="creator">Lothian, Andrew</field><field name="description">The object of this thesis is to provide, through a thorough analysis of human perception and interaction with aesthetics and landscape quality, a comprehensive basis on which to develop a credible methodology for the large scale assessment of perceived landscape quality.

However, the effect of drip irrigation on seasonal and long term (e.g. over 50 years) changes in soil chemical properties is poorly understood, complicated by the two-dimensional water flow patterns beneath drippers. Field and laboratory experiments were conducted, along with computer modelling, to evaluate morphological and physio-chemical changes in a typical Barossa Valley Red Brown Earth (Palexeralf, Chromosol or Lixisol) when drip irrigated under various changing management practices. This work focused on the following two management changes : (i) switching from long-term irrigation with a saline source to less saline water and (ii) gypsum (CaSO&#8324;) application. A literature review (Chapter 1) focuses on the distribution, features, properties and management of Red Brown Earths in the premium viticultural regions of the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale, South Australia. The effects of irrigation method and water quality on the rate and extent of soil deterioration are emphasised. The review also discusses the irrigation of grapes (Vitis vinifera) and summarises previous research into the effect of sodicity and salinity on grape and wine characteristics. This chapter shows the importance of Red Brown Earths to Australian viticulture, but highlights their susceptibility to chemical and physical degradation. Degradation may be prevented or remediated by increasing organic matter levels, applying gypsum, modifying cropping and through tillage practices such as deep ripping. Chapter 2 provides general information on the two study sites investigated, one in the Barossa Valley and the other at McLaren Vale. Local climate, geology, geomorphology and soils are described. Chapter 3 details laboratory, field and sampling methods used to elucidate changes in soil chemical and physical properties following irrigation. The genesis of the non-irrigated Red Brown Earth in the Barossa Valley is described in Chapter 4, and is inferred from geochemical, soil chemical, layer silicate and carbonate mineralogical data. Elemental gain and loss calculations showed 42% of original parent material mass was lost during the formation of A and A2 horizons, while the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons gained 50% of original parent material mass. This is consistent with substrate weathering and illuviation of clay from surface to lower horizons. The depth distributions of all major elements were similar ; the A horizon contained lower amounts of major elements than the remainder of the profile, indicating this region was intensely weathered. This chapter also compares the non-irrigated site to the adjacent irrigated site (separated by 10 m) to determine if the sites are pedogenically identical and geochemical changes from irrigation. Many of the differences between the non-irrigated and irrigated sites appear to be correlated with variations in quartz, clay, Fe oxide and carbonate contents, with little geological variation between the sample sites. In Chapter 5 morphological, chemical and physical properties of a non-irrigated and irrigated Red Brown Earth in the Barossa Valley are compared. Alternating applications of saline irrigation water (in summer) and non-saline rain water (in winter) have caused an increase in electrical conductivity (EC [subscript se]), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), bulk density (&#961; b) and pH. This has resulted in enhanced clay dispersion and migration. Impacts on SAR and &#961; b are more pronounced at points away from the dripper due to the presence of an argillic horizon, which has greatly influenced the variations in these soil properties with depth and distance from the dripper. Dispersion and migration of clay were promoted by alternating levels of EC, while SAR remained relatively constant, resulting in the formation of a less permeable layer in the Bt1 horizon. Clay dispersion (breakdown of micro-aggregate structure) was inferred from reduced numbers of pores and voids, alterations in colouring (an indication that iron has changed oxidation state) and increased bulk density (up to 30 %). Eleven years of irrigation changed the soil from a Calcic Palexeralf (non-irrigated) to an Aquic Natrixeralf (irrigated) (Soil Survey Staff, 1999). These results, combined with data from Chapter 4, were used to develop a mechanistic model of soil changes with irrigation. Chapters 6, 7 and 8 describe field experiments conducted in the Barossa Valley and McLaren Vale regions. This data shows seasonal and spatial variations in soil saturation extract properties ( EC [subscript se], SAR [subscript se], Na [subscipt se] and Ca [subscript se] ). At the Barossa Valley site (Chapter 6) non-irrigated soils had low EC [subscript se], SAR [subscript se], Na [subscript se] and Ca [subscript se] values throughout the sampling period. The irrigated treatments included eleven years of drip irrigation with saline water (2.5 dS / m) and also gypsum application at 0, 4 or 8 tonnes/hectare in 2001 and 2002. Salts in the profile increased with gypsum application rate, with high levels occurring midwinter 2002 prior to rainfall leaching salts. SAR has declined with gypsum application, particularly in the A horizon and at 100 cm from the dripper in the Bt1 horizon ; this has the potential to reflocculate clay particles and improve soil hydraulic conductivity. Chapter 7 presents further results from the Barossa Valley site, this treatment had been irrigated for 9 years with saline water (2.5 dS / m) prior to switching to a less saline water source (0.5 dS / m). The soil also received gypsum at 0, 4 or 8 tonnes / hectare in 2001 and 2002. It was found that the first few years are critical when switching to a less saline water source. EC declines rapidly, but SAR requires a number of years, depending on conditions, to decline, resulting in a period during which the Bt1 horizon may become dispersed. Gypsum application increased the EC [subscipt se] but not to the EC [subscript se] levels of soil irrigated with saline water. Chapter 8 examines soil chemical properties of a McLaren Vale vineyard, irrigated with moderately saline water (1.2 dS / m) since 1987 and treated with gypsum every second year since establishment. This practice prevented the SAR (&lt; 8) rising and a large zone of the soil profile (20 to 100 cm from dripper) has a high calcium level (&gt; 5 mmol / L). However, irrigation caused the leaching of calcium beneath the dripper in both the A and B horizons (0 to 20 cm from dripper) (&lt; 4 mmol / L). Chapters 9 and 10 interpret and discuss results from continuous monitoring of redox potential (Eh) and soil solution composition in the Barossa Valley vineyard, irrigated with saline or non-saline water, and gypsum-treated at 0 and 4 tonnes / hectare. Soil pore water solution (Chapter 9) collected by suction cups is compared to results obtained in chapters 6 and 7. The soil has extended zones and times of high SAR and low EC. This was particularly evident in the upper B horizon, where the SAR of the soil remained stable throughout the year while the EC was more seasonally variable with EC declining during the winter months. The A horizon does not appear to be as susceptible to clay dispersion (compared to the B horizon) because during periods of low EC the SAR also declines, which may be due to the low CEC (low clay and organic matter content) of this horizon. Chapter 10 presents redox potentials (Eh) measured using platinum redox electrodes installed in the A, A2 and Bt1 horizons to examine whether Eh of the profile varies with irrigation water quality and gypsum application. Saline irrigation water caused the B horizon to become waterlogged in winter months, while less saline irrigation water caused a perched watertable to develop, due to a dispersed Bt1 horizon. Application of gypsum reduced the soil Eh particularly in the A2 horizon (+ 500 to + 50 mV) during winter. Thus redox potential can be influenced by irrigation water quality and gypsum applications. Chapter 11 incorporated site data from the Barossa Valley non-irrigated site into a predictive mathematical model, TRANSMIT, a 2D version of LEACHM. This model was used to predict zones of gypsum accumulation during long-term irrigation (67 years). When applied over the entire soil surface, gypsum accumulated at 60 to 90 cm from the dripper in the B horizon; higher application rates caused increased accumulation. When applied immediately beneath the irrigation dripper, gypsum accumulated in a 'column' under the dripper (at 0 to 35 cm radius from the dripper), with very little movement away from the dripper. Also, the zone of accumulation of salts from high and low salinity irrigation water was investigated. These regions were found to be similar, although concentrations were significantly lower with low salinity water. In low rainfall years salts accumulated throughout the B horizon (35 - 150 cm), while in periods of high rainfall (and leaching) the A, A2 and Bt1 horizons (0 - 60 cm) were leached, although at greater depths (80 - 150 cm) salt concentrations remained high. Chapter 12 summarises results and provides an understanding of soil processes in drip irrigated soils to underpin improved management options for viticulture. This study combines results from redox and soil solution monitoring, mineralogy, elemental gains and losses, and seasonal soil sampling to develop a mechanistic model of soil processes, which was combined with computer modelling to predict future properties of the soil. Major conclusions and recommendations of this study include : - Application of saline irrigation water to soil then ameliorated with gypsum - The first application of gypsum was leached by the subsequent irrigation from extended regions of the soil. As Na continues to enter the system via irrigation water, gypsum needs to be regularly applied. Otherwise calcium will be leached through the soil and SAR increases. - Application of non-saline irrigation water to soil then ameliorated with gypsum - The soil was found to only require one application at 8 tons / ha as this reduced SAR sufficiently. As less salt is entering the soil, subsequent gypsum applications can be at a lower rate or less frequently than required for saline irrigation water. - Gypsum applied directly beneath the dripper systems distributes calcium to a narrow region of the soil, while large regions of the soil require amelioration (high SAR) and are not receiving calcium. Therefore, gypsum application through the drip system or only beneath the dripper should be combined with broad acre application. - A range of methods to sample vineyards is recommended for duplex soils, including the use of saturation extracts, sampling time, sampling location (distance from dripper) and depth of sampling. This work is critical for vineyard management and may be applicable to other Australian viticulture regions with Red Brown Earths.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapes irrigation, salinity, sodicity, salt-affected soils</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity and self - organization : data analysis and models</field><field name="creator">Bartolozzi, Marco</field><field name="description">The understanding of the emergent behaviour of complex systems is probably one of the most intriguing challenges in modern theoretical physics. In the present Thesis we use novel data analysis techniques and numerical simulations in order to shed some light on the fundamental mechanisms involved in their dynamics. We divide the main core of the research into three parts, each of which address a specific, and formally well defined, issue. In the first part, we study the processes of self - organization and herding in the evolution of the stock market. The data analysis, carried out over the fluctuations of several international indices, shows an avalanche - like dynamics characterized by power laws and indicative of a critical state. Further evidence of criticality relates to the behaviour of the price index itself. In this case we observe a power law decline with superimposed embedded log - periodic oscillations which are possibly due to an intrinsic discrete scale invariance. A stochastic cellular automata, instead, is used to mimic an open stock market and reproduce the herding behaviour responsible for the large fluctuations observed in the price. The results underline the importance of the largest clusters of traders which, alone, can induce a large displacement between demand and supply and lead to a crash. The second part of the Thesis focuses on the role played by the complex network of interactions that is created among the elementary parts of the system itself. We consider, in particular, the influence of the so - called " scale - free " networks, where the distribution of connectivity follows a power law, on the antiferromagnetic Ising model and on a model of stochastic opinion formation. Novel features, not encountered on regular lattices, have been pointed out. In the former case a spin glass transition at low temperatures is present while, in the latter, the turbulent - like behaviour emerging from the model is found to be particularly robust against the indecision of the agents. The last part is left for a numerical investigation of an extremal dynamical model for evolution / extinction of species. We demonstrate how the mutual cooperation between them comes to play a fundamental role in the survival probability : a healthy environment can support even less fitted species.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">econophysics</field><field name="subject">Self-organizing systems</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Stock exchanges Data processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Soil water and nitrogen dynamics of farming systems on the upper Eyre Peninsula, South Australia</field><field name="creator">Adcock, Damien Paul</field><field name="description">In the semi - arid Mediterranean - type environments of southern Australia, soil and water resources largely determine crop productivity and ultimately the sustainability of farming systems within the region. The development of sustainable farming systems is a constantly evolving process, of which cropping sequences ( rotations ) are an essential component. This thesis focused on two important soil resources, soil water and nitrogen, and studied the effects of different crop sequences on the dynamic of these resources within current farming systems practiced on the upper Eyre Peninsula of South Australia. The hypothesis tested was that : continuous cropping may alter N dynamics but will not necessarily alter water use efficiency in semi - arid Mediterranean - type environments. Continuous cropping altered N - dynamics ; increases in inorganic N were dependent on the inclusion of a legume in the cropping sequence. Associated with the increase in inorganic N supply was a decrease in WUE by the subsequent wheat crop. Overall, estimates of water use efficiency, a common index of the sustainability of farming systems, in this study concur with reported values for the semi - arid Murray - Mallee region of southern Australia and other semi - arid environments worldwide. Soil water balance and determination of WUE for a series of crop sequences in this thesis suggests that the adoption of continuous cropping may increase WUE and confer a yield benefit compared to crop sequences including a legume component in this environment. No differences in total water use ( ET ) at anthesis or maturity were measured for wheat regardless of the previous crop. Soil evaporation ( E [subscript s] ) was significantly affected by crop canopy development, measured as LAI from tillering until anthesis in 2002, however total seasonal E [subscript s] did not differ between crop sequences. Indeed in environments with infrequent rainfall, such as the upper Eyre Peninsula, soil evaporation may be water - limited rather than energy limited and the potential benefits from greater LAI and reduced E [subscript s] are less. Greater shoot dry matter production and LAI due to an enhanced inorganic N supply for wheat after legumes, and to a lesser degree wheat after canola, relative to continuous cereal crop sequences resulted in increases in WUE calculated at anthesis, as reported by others. Nonetheless the increase in WUE was not sustained due to limitations on available soil water capacity caused by soil physical and chemical constraints. Access to more soil water at depth ( &gt; 0.8m ) through additional root growth was unavailable due to soil chemical limitations. More importantly, the amount of plant available water within the ' effective rooting depth ' ( 0 - 0.8m ) was significantly reduced when soil physical factors were accounted for using the integral water capacity ( IWC ) concept. The difference between the magnitude of the plant available water capacity and the integral water capacity was approximately 90mm within the ' effective rooting depth ' when measured at field capacity, suggesting that the ability of the soil to store water and buffer against periodic water deficit was severely limited. The IWC concept offers a method of evaluating the physical quality of soils and the limitations that these physical properties, viz. aeration, soil strength and hydraulic conductivity, impose on the water supply capacity of the soil. The inability of the soil to maintain a constant supply of water to satisfy maximal transpiration efficiency combined with large amounts of N resulted in ' haying off ', and reduced grain yields. A strong negative linear relationship was established between WUE of grain production by wheat and increasing soil NO [subscript 3] - N at sowing in 2000 and 2002, which conflicts with results from experiments in semi - arid Mediterranean climates in other regions of the world where applications of N increased water use efficiency of grain. Estimates of proportional dependence on N [subscript 2] fixation ( % N [subscript dfa] ) for annual medics and vetch from this study ( 43 - 80 % ) are comparable to others for environments in southern Australia ( &lt; 450mm average annual rainfall ). Such estimates of fixation are considered low ( &lt; 65 % ) to adequate ( 65 - 80 % ). Nevertheless, the amount of plant available N present at sowing for subsequent wheat crops, and the occurrence of ' haying off ', suggests that WUE is not N - limited per se, as implied by some reports, but constrained by the capacity of a soil to balance the co - limiting factors of water and nitrogen.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agricultural systems, cropping systems, sustainable agriculture, crop rotations, soils nitrogen content</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of a " Glucose Release Index " to assess physical and chemical characteristics of cereal grains that may influence starch digestion and subsequent energy supply to monogastrics</field><field name="creator">Zarrinkalam, Mohammad-Reza</field><field name="description">In the pig and poultry production industries, energy forms the largest and the greatest cost pressure when a diet is formulated. In Australia, cereal grains such as barley, sorghum, and wheat are the main dietary energy sources, comprising more than 60 % of the diet in many cases. Traditionally, during diet formulation, the energy value of a grain has been represented by a single figure for that particular grain type. However, several studies have indicated that the energy availability from different grains fed to pigs and poultry varies significantly even within one grain cultivar. Given these findings, the use of a single value to represent the energy of each grain type during diet formulation, can lead to inefficient utilisation of dietary resources by animals, and thus decreased animal performance and consequently, a decrease in profit for the pig and poultry production industries. Thus, there is an opportunity to develop a rapid and reproducible in vitro assay to accurately assess the available energy values and nutritional quality of each grain type. In order to develop such an assay, further understanding of factors that affect the available energy values of grains need to be explored. Starch, which is hydrolysed into glucose by animals, is the most abundant energy component in cereal grains, and there is evidence suggesting that variations in digestible or metabolisable energy values may be related to the extent of starch digestibility. For example in poultry, variations in the in vitro digestibility of starch between several wheat cultivars have been shown to correlate with their in vivo available metabolisable energy values. However, it is not known to what extent starch digestibility varies between cultivars of other grain types such as barley and sorghum. There is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that differences in the physical and chemical properties of cereal grains may play an important role in influencing starch digestibility and, consequently, animal performance. Thus, the general hypothesis of this study was that starch digestibility varies between barley, sorghum and wheat, and between cultivars within grain types and this is related to specific chemical and physical characteristics of the grains. To examine this, the following issues were investigated using 18 barley, 15 sorghum and 10 wheat cultivars : 1 ) an in vitro glucose release index ( GRI ) assay was developed to assess starch digestibility within and between the cereal grain types and, 2 ) the GRI was correlated to both starch - related ( e.g., starch content, starch granule size, the amylose to amylopectin ratio, starch gelatinisation properties ) and non - starch - related ( e.g., non - starch polysaccharide composition, kernel hardness, the presence of protein matrix and milling quality ) physical / chemical characteristics within and between the cereal grains. Results revealed significant variations in the GRI both between grains and within a given grain type. The GRI values ranged between 27 - 45 %, 25 - 54 % and 32 - 53 % in barley, sorghum and wheat respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that the GRI in barley, sorghum and wheat was influenced by the physical and chemical characteristics of starch - and non - starch - related grain properties, although the type of characteristic influencing GRI was specific to the grain type. In barley, the ratio of amylose to amylopectin, starch gelatinisation and kernel hardness influenced the GRI. In sorghum, the GRI was influenced by the ratio of amylose to amylopectin, the presence of a protein matrix surrounding starch granules and kernel hardness. Finally in wheat, the presence of protein matrix and milling quality influenced the GRI. It was also shown that the extract viscosity of grains within barley and wheat, but not sorghum, varied significantly. In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that ; 1 ) the GRI assay may be used to identify some factors that affect in vivo starch digestibility within and between barley, sorghum and wheat, 2 ) starch digestibility ( as assessed by the GRI ) may be influenced by some physical and chemical characteristics of cereal grains, and that these characteristics are specific to the type of grain The physical and chemical characteristics that may influence starch digestion will be discussed in relation to their potential physiological effects on energy digestion, and utilisation in animals. The information generated will provide a basis for future studies that will ultimately assist in the design of in vitro assays to predict energy availability from barley, sorghum and wheat grains fed to pigs and poultry, and contribute to the more efficient use of grains in monogastric production systems.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">barley, sorghum, wheat, grain as feed, animal industry, digestion, grain nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parapsychological investigation of the theory of Psychopraxia: experimental and theoretical researches into an alternative theory explaining normal and paranormal phenomena</field><field name="creator">Storm, Lance Charles</field><field name="description">A series of four experiments were conducted to test Thalbourne's theory of psychopraxia (Thalbourne, 2000a). The thesis begins with an introduction to the field of parapsychology in the form of an argument against extreme skepticism (Chapter 1). It argues that skeptics have failed to produce cogent arguments to undermine the hypothesis that so-called paranormal phenomena exist. A review of the parapsychological meta-analyses (Chapters 2 and 3) provides supporting evidence of the hypothesis that paranormal effects do exist. By argument and by experimentation, the study of anomalous phenomena is deemed justifiable, thus, establishing a rationale for investigation of paranormal phenomena, with particular focus on the theory of psychopraxia. Chapter 4 introduces the theory of psychopraxia - the term 'psychopraxia' is derived from two Greek words: psyche, which means 'soul' or 'mind' or 'self', and praxia, from which we get our word 'practice' (derived from prattein, meaning 'to accomplish' or 'bring about'). The theory of psychopraxia is an attempt to unify both normal and paranormal psychology, and motor action and cognition, so that the conceptual distinction between (i) ESP and PK, and (ii) normal information-acquisition and normal motor control might be 'eliminated' (Thalbourne, 1982, pp. 62-63) since both sides of the dichotomy are instances of action. The present thesis is an investigation of the theory from the perspective of paranormal phenomena only. In Chapters 5 and 6, an experiment is described that uses an ancient Chinese form of divination known as the I Ching. The I Ching experiment was conducted to test the psychopractic hypothesis that the ESP-PK dichotomy can be unworkable in practice because either (a) an anomalous mental process (suggesting ESP), or (b) an anomalous physical process (suggesting PK), or both (a) and (b) might be involved in the I Ching process. Evidence was found that the I Ching may involve a paranormal component, but this process could not be explained exclusively as either ESP or PK. According to the theory of psychopraxia, the ostensibly paranormal anomaly identified in the I Ching process is described as exosomatic psychopraxia (i.e., the psychopractic function working outside the mind/body complex). In Chapter 7 a forced-choice card-identifying experiment was conducted to test a basic proposition of the theory of psychopraxia known as the 'pro attitude', which is an orientation of the self towards a specific and preferred outcome or goal. Participants had to locate 5 aces of spades in 5 'hands' of cards, while avoiding the aces of clubs. A significant negative relationship was found between spade hitting and club hitting, suggesting that 'compliant' pro attitudes and 'noncompliant' pro attitudes are incompatible. Post hoc evidence was also found that participants do not necessarily comply with the experimental protocol due to attitudes and dispositions that conflict with the protocol. In Chapter 8, another forced-choice experiment was run on computer to test the concept of the pro attitude from a different perspective. Post hoc evidence was found that the pro attitude of 'converted' skeptics (i.e., skeptics who became believers) changed when an experimental treatment conducive to a change of pro attitude was introduced. There was also evidence that the pro attitude of 'entrenched' skeptics (i.e., skeptics who remained skeptics) did not change even when an experimental treatment ostensibly conducive to a change of pro attitude was introduced. The latter result suggests that the pro attitude may remain fixed over time. In Chapter 9 a free-response study was conducted to test vision-impaired participants against sighted participants. The theory of psychopraxia argues that compensation for an adverse condition (such as blindness) may take the form of paranormal functioning. Evidence of paranormal effects was found, but no evidence was found that the vision-impaired had an advantage over sighted participants. In support of the compensation hypothesis, however, there was suggestive evidence that the totally blind performed better than all other participants combined. The so-called 'necessary condition' is another basic proposition of the theory of psychopraxia. In all the above four experiments, evidence was found, in the relevant experiments, that certain conditions were necessary and sufficient in bringing about paranormal effects in the respective experimental situations: (1) High scoring on four personality factors as measured on Cattell's 16PF: Factor F (Liveliness), Factor H (Social Boldness), Factor EX (Extraversion), Factor IN (Independence); (2) Low scoring on Factor Q4 (Tension); (3) Extreme scores on the Transliminality Scale (a measure of the tendency to experience psychological material coming into, and going out of consciousness); (4) Belief in paranormal processes; (5) Low scores on attitude towards horseracing; and (6) Relaxation. Two other conditions were introduced in Chapter 10: (i) perceived simplicity of the apparatus and experimental procedure, and (ii) ease of the paranormal task. These two conditions and six 'states of mind' (i.e., 'freshness', 'sobriety', 'attentiveness', 'confidence', 'fitness,' and 'energy level') were hypothesized as being conditions conducive to paranormal effects. In Chapter 11, suggestive evidence was found that simplicity of the experimental apparatus and procedure had a positive effect on paranormal performance. Two 'states of mind' ('freshness' and 'confidence') were found to correlate significantly with paranormal outcomes, but only in the I Ching experiment. These conditions were also found to be necessary and sufficient in bringing about hexagram hitting. In Chapter 12, the theory of psychopraxia was argued as being important to the field of parapsychology because it offered (a) a philosophical critique on taken-for-granted assumptions about the nature of the paranormal, (b) relatively unambiguous terminology, and (c) a process-oriented approach to investigations of the paranormal by concentrating on conditions deemed necessary in bringing about paranormal effects. In its current form, the psychopraxia model needs clarification of its most crucial concepts ('self', 'pro attitude', and 'necessary conditions') before it can be regarded as a workable theory.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parapsychology investigation, paranormal</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chemotherapy - induced intestinal mucositis : the role of apoptosis regulators</field><field name="creator">Bowen, Joanne M</field><field name="description">Mucositis is the damage that occurs to the alimentary canal from anti - cancer therapies. It is caused by chemotherapy, radiotherapy and combination therapy and affects a large proportion of patients. Despite its prevalence, an effective anti - mucositis agent has yet to be developed that protects the whole tube, although the use of keratinocyte growth factor ( Amgen ' s Palifermin ) has recently been approved for the prevention of oral mucositis. It is important to understand mechanisms controlling mucositis so that treatment can be targeted appropriately. This thesis has investigated some of the key components identified as being involved in mucositis as well as identifying new genes which contribute to chemotherapy - induced intestinal injury. The research chapters investigated : 1 ) Gene expression of the apoptosis - regulating Bcl - 2 family, p53 and caspase - 3, and the changes which occur in the intestine following chemotherapy treatment for cancer. 2 ) The effect of different chemotherapeutic agents on intestinal cells in vitro and the role p53 plays. 3 ) The mucositis caused by single dose irinotecan in the rat with breast cancer and the role of p53 in induction of intestinal damage. 4 ) The early gene changes that occur in the small intestine of the rat with breast cancer following irinotecan treatment. Firstly, to investigate the difference in susceptibility to damage between the small and large intestine, the protein expression of 8 members of the Bcl - 2 family ( 4 pro - apoptotic ; Bax, Bak, Bid, Bim and 4 anti - apoptotic ; Bcl - 2, Bcl - xL, Bcl - w, Mcl - 1 ) was quantified in jejunal and colonic sections taken from rats inoculated with breast cancer. It was found that there was significantly higher expression of the pro - apoptotic proteins, Bax, Bak, Bim and Bid, in the crypts of the jejunum compared to the colon. Furthermore, expression of the anti - apoptotic proteins, Bcl - 2, Bcl - xL and Bcl - w, was significantly lower in jejunal crypts compared to colonic crypts. Mcl - 1 expression was similar in both regions. Thus, the small intestine is an environment balanced to favour apoptosis through specific Bcl - 2 family protein expression profiles. The Bcl - 2 family regulates apoptosis in response to a variety of chemotherapy agents. However, it is unknown how Bcl - 2 family gene expression changes along with other apoptogenic factors following cytotoxic therapy in the normal intestine. To investigate this, sections of rat jejunum treated with methotrexate and duodenal biopsies from chemotherapy patients treated with various regimens for cancer were subjected to quantitative immunohistochemistry to detect Bcl - 2 family proteins, p53 and caspase - 3. Treatment caused expression of p53 and caspase - 3 to increase within the crypts and follow a similar pattern to apoptosis levels. Pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 family members, Bax and Bak, were increased, while the anti - apoptotic protein, Mcl - 1, was significantly reduced. A significant increase in mRNA expression for Bax and Bak was noticed at 6 h, without a concurrent decrease in Mcl - 1. Thus, Bcl - 2 family genes were altered in the small intestine in both humans and rats, and this was irrespective of chemotherapy agent or regimen used. The best characterised changes which occur during chemotherapy - induced damage in the intestine are in the epithelial layer, although it is thought that pan #45 mucosal alterations are involved. Two intestinal cell lines were chosen to investigate changes in apoptosis, proliferation and protein expression following cytotoxic treatment with various chemotherapeutic agents. These were the rat IEC - 6 and human FHs 74 cell lines, which represent untransformed epithelial cells. The human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF - 7, was also used as a positive control. Intestinal cells were resistant to the occurrence of methotrexate toxicities within 24 h of treatment, modestly affected by irinotecan and extremely sensitive to doxorubicin. Doxorubicin caused a marked increase in p53 and p21 expression, which for irinotecan was less pronounced. The effect of cytotoxic treatment on Bcl - 2 family expression in intestinal cells varied, however the pro - apoptotic proteins, Bax and Bak, were generally upregulated following doxorubicin. Temporary inhibition of p53 using pifithrin alpha resulted in a significant improvement in cell survival in cancerous cell only and did not alter Bcl - 2 family expression. It was concluded that cultured epithelial cells exhibit varying sensitivities to different chemotherapeutic agents which is dependent on induction of p53 gene expression. The topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan, is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. It often induces severe mucositis with the most common symptom being diarrhoea. Previous research has shown that irinotecan damages the small and large bowel equally, which is unusual. This is characterised by an increase in apoptosis and a reduction in proliferation within epithelial crypts, an increase in inflammatory cell infiltrate in the lamina propria and excess mucin production. These investigations used two sequential doses of irinotecan. The early effect of a single dose of irinotecan on the intestine have yet to be studied. Thus the primary aim of this experiment was to examine in detail the changes caused by irinotecan at 6 and 48 h in the rat. A secondary aim was to investigate the role of p53 on induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest within intestinal crypts and the effect of temporary inhibition of the protein. Single dose irinotecan caused a decrease in body and small intestinal weight by 48 h after treatment. This was accompanied by crypt and villous degeneration, increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation within crypt epithelium as well as inflammatory infiltrate throughout lamina propria. An increase in Bax expression was seen at 6 h, however p53 protein levels remained relatively low until 48 h. Rats also treated with pifithrin alpha to inhibit p53 and had a significantly lower peak in apoptosis in the colon at 6 h, however did not show improvements in any other parameters tested. It was concluded that irinotecaninduced damage in the rat intestine is primarily p53 - independent, and that pifithrin alpha acts to inhibit apoptosis in the large intestine via a p53 - independent pathway. A study was designed to investigate the early genome - wide changes which occur following irinotecan treatment in the rat small intestine. Microarray analysis found that regulation of many genes was altered at 6 h following dual dose irinotecan. These genes were involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, immune function, calcium homeostasis and protein turnover. Multiple genes from the MAP kinase pathway were also activated by irinotecan. The cystine protease, caspase - 1 was upregulated and was chosen for further investigations due to its role in apoptosis and inflammation. Real time PCR analysis confirmed the increase in gene expression at 6 h and also showed a return to baseline levels by 24 h which was followed by another modest increase at 48 h. It was concluded that irinotecan induces a wide range of gene changes within the intestine and that apoptosis and inflammatory damage pathways are activated during treatment. This thesis described key molecules in apoptosis and their role in induction of chemotherapy - induced intestinal mucositis. It has provided evidence of the importance of apoptosis in mucosal injury and also highlighted areas requiring further research. Results presented herein show that the Bcl - 2 family is involved in intestinal damage following many chemotherapy agents, whereas p53 is agent - specific. It has also shown that irinotecan causes intestinal damage via a mainly p53 - independent manner in the rat. It can be concluded that gastrointestinal mucositis is complex and activates multiple pathways to induce damage. Findings from this thesis will aid targeting of new anti - mucotoxic agents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer chemotherapy complications, gastrointestinal mucosa diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nomadology in architecture: ephemerality, movement and collaboration.</field><field name="creator">Cowan, Gregory</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the theoretical and practical importance of nomadic ways of life for architecture. Nomadology is a construction of Deleuze and Guattari's 'counter-philosophy', challenging authenticity and propriety, in this case, in the context of architecture. This thesis describes how nomadology may serve contemporary architectural practice and criticism; challenging static, permanent, and heroically solitary ways of working and dwelling. Nomadology in architecture proposes ways for thinking and working temporally, dynamically, and collaboratively. The thesis suggests strategies - diagramming, ephemerality, movement, and collaboration - as ways of reconciling nomadism and architecture. The 'Contexts' section of this thesis surveys Western and global contexts of understanding nomads and nomadology, and how these pertain to architecture. Western conceptions of architecture have inhibited the study of nomadology in architecture. A case is made for challenging biases in Western views of architecture, for critically employing the ideas of the diagram and the rhizome in architectural criticism, and for recognising the role of movement. The 'Applications' section shows, through practical examples, that the potential of nomadology is latent in spatial and environmental practices of architectural production and architectural criticism. This section of the thesis identifies the significance of nomads as users and exponents of architecture, despite their frequent exclusion from architectural history. Tent architecture, practices of nomadic resistance and Bedouin life practices are considered as key examples. The 'Strategies' section suggests ways of applying principles of nomadology. This final section expands on the potential for 'peripatetic' practices of architecture. Processes of reconciling settled and nomadic tendencies in architectural projects are outlined. Strategies are described by which engendering and collaborating may be the means for creating architecture. The continuing research into, and interpretation of nomadology in architecture are proposed as a basis for critical theorisation and reflective practice of architecture.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gilles Deleuze, Felix Guattari, architecture, Bedouins, Nomads, tents</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37830</field></doc><doc><field name="title">QoS enabled IP based wireless networking : design, modelling and performance analysis</field><field name="creator">Gyasi-Agyei, Amoakoh</field><field name="description">Quality of service differentiation has never achieved much attention and relevance until the advent of the convergence of mobile wireless network and the fixed Internet, that is, Internet Protocol ( IP ) based mobile wireless networks, or wireless Internet. These networks are poised to support multimedia applications ' traffic with diverse QoS sensitivities. To date, most traffic transferred over the Internet still undergo best - effort forwarding, which does not guarantee whether or not traffic sent by a source gets to the intended destination, let alone loss and timing bounds. The major contribution of this thesis is three - fold. First, the thesis proposes a QoS - enabled wireless Internet access architecture, which leverages the micromobility in wireless standards to reduce mobile IP weaknesses, such as long handoff delay, to achieve effective interworking between mobile wireless networks and the global, fixed Internet. Although the idea here is applicable to any wireless standard, the design examples in this thesis are based on the IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network ( WLAN ) standard. Second, it proposes a framework for a class of wireless channel state dependent packet scheduling schemes, which consider the QoS requirements of the applications ' traffic ; the wireless channel state ( reflected in instantaneous data rate or noise level ) ; and optimises the usage of the expensive wireless resource. The operation of the QoS - enabled, channel state - dependent packet scheduler is analysed using optimisation theory, eigenanalysis and stochastic modelling. Third, the thesis analyses the effects of wireless channel properties on differentiated QoS ( DQoS ) schemes, using two - dimensional, channel - state - dependent queuing theory, matrix analytic methods to stochastic modelling and eigenanalysis. The ana - lytical model of DQoS schemes, especially models accounting for user scenarios such as speed of motion and wireless channel properties, such as fading, spatio - temporarily varying quality and low rate, is not properly covered in the open literature, and hence was a motivation for this part of the thesis. The wireless channel is discretized into discrete - time Markovian states based on the received signal - to - noise plus interference ratio ( SNIR ), which also reflects on the instantaneous link quality. The link quality, in turn, influences the QoS experienced by the transported applications sitting on top of the ISO / OSI protocol hierarchy. The parameters of the Markovian states are evaluated using realistic physical channel noise models and transceiver characteristics, such as modem. [ Different modems ( modulator / demodulator ) yields different transceiver properties such as sensitivity. The analysis in the thesis adopts QPSKand BPSK modulation. ] Source traffic models are used in the analysis. Lastly, the thesis provides an extensive introduction to, and provides a detailed background material for the new area of mobile wireless Internet systems, upon which considerable future research can be based.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems, wireless internet</field><field name="subject">Integrated services digital networks Quality control.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks Quality control.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks Reliability.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and modelling of hydrological persistence with hidden Markov models</field><field name="creator">Whiting, Julian Peter</field><field name="description">Hydrological observations are characterised by wet and dry cycles, a characteristic that is termed hydrological persistence. Interactions between global climate phenomena and the hydrological cycle result in rainfall and streamflow data clustering into wetter and drier states. These states have implications for the management and planning of water resources. Statistical tests constructed from the theory of wet and dry spells indicate that evidence for persistence in monthly observations is more compelling than at an annual scale. This thesis demonstrates that examination of monthly data yields spatially - consistent patterns of persistence across a range of hydrological variables. It is imperative that time series models for rainfall and streamflow replicate the observed fluctuations between the climate regimes. Monthly time series are generally represented with linear models such as ARMA variants ; however simulations from such models may underestimate the magnitude and frequency of persistence. A different approach to modelling these data is to incorporate shifting levels in the broader climate with a tendency to persist within these regimes. Hidden Markov models ( HMMs ) provide a strong conceptual basis for describing hydrological persistence, and are shown to provide accurate descriptions of fluctuating climate states. These models are calibrated here with a full Bayesian approach to quantify parameter uncertainty. A range of novel variations to standard HMMs are introduced, in particular Autoregressive HMMs and hidden semi - Markov models which have rarely been used to model monthly rainfall totals. The former model combines temporal persistence within observations with fluctuations between persistent climate states, and is particularly appropriate for modelling streamflow time series. The latter model extends the modelling capability of HMMs by fitting explicit probability distributions for state durations. These models have received little attention for modelling persistence at monthly scale. A non - parametric ( NP ) HMM, which overcomes the major shortcomings of standard parametric HMMs, is also described. Through removing the requirement to assume parametric forms of conditional distributions prior to model calibration, the innovative NP HMM framework provides an improved estimation of persistence in discrete and continuous data that remains unaffected by incorrect parametric assumptions about the state distributions. Spatially - consistent persistence is identified across Australia with the NP HMM, showing a tendency toward stronger persistence in low-rainfall regions. Coherent signatures of persistence are also identified across time series of total monthly rainfall, numbers of rain - days each month, and the intensities of the most extreme rain events recorded each month over various short durations, illustrating that persistent climate states modulate both the numbers of rain events and the amount of moisture contained within these events. These results provide a new interpretation of the climatic interactions that underlie hydrological persistence. The value of HMMs to water resource management is illustrated with the accurate simulation of a range of hydrologic data, which in each case preserves statistics and spell properties over a range of aggregations. Catchment - scale rainfall for the Warragamba Reservoir is simulated accurately with HMMs, and rainfall - runoff transformations from these simulations provide reservoir inflows of lower drought risk than provided from ARMA models.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Markov processes, hydrology, hydraulic engineering</field><field name="subject">Markov processes</field><field name="subject">Hydrologic models</field><field name="subject">Hydrology Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mobilisation of soil phosphorus in surface runoff from intensively managed pastures in South-East Australia</field><field name="creator">Dougherty, Warwick John</field><field name="description">The application of substantial quantities of phosphorus (P) has been required to increase productivity on many Australian soils. Unfortunately, these applications have often resulted in increased concentrations of P in surface runoff that contributes to excessive algal growth in surface waters and consequently a decline in their quality. The concentrations of P in runoff from intensively managed pastures are often high (1-5 mg/L) and typically at least an order of magnitude higher than water quality targets. Although a substantial amount of research has been devoted to the problem of P accumulation and mobilisation in arable systems ( in which P is typically mobilised by the action of raindrop impact and subsequently transported in particulate form ), there has been substantially less research in intensively managed pasture systems. Consequently, there is a paucity of knowledge concerning the fundamental processes and factors responsible for P in runoff from these systems and a dearth of truly effective remedial strategies. In this thesis, the accumulation of P in soil under intensively managed pastures used for dairying and the processes responsible for its mobilisation in surface runoff were investigated. This research was undertaken at two research sites in South - east Australia, i.e. Camden in New South Wales and Flaxley in South Australia. A number of factors relating to scale and hydrology may influence the processes of P mobilisation and its concentration in runoff. A comparison was made of the forms and concentrations of P in runoff between a typical rainfall simulation methodology and large runoff plots. The effect of rainfall intensity on the forms and concentrations of P was also investigated. The concentrations of P in runoff from small - scale, high - intensity rainfall simulations were on average 33 % lower than those from large plots ( approximating hillslopes ) although the processes of mobilisation ( as evidenced by runoff P forms ) were similar. Increasing rainfall intensity resulted in decreasing P concentrations, but similar forms of P. It was hypothesised that changes in hydrological characteristics ( residence time and depth of runoff ) were responsible for the differences in the P concentrations. A model of P mobilisation ( incorporating hydrological and P - release characteristics ) was developed and shown to successfully predict runoff P concentrations under a range of rainfall intensities. These findings and the subsequent model were used in the successful modelling of landscape scale nutrient exports based on rainfall simulation data as part of a separate, but complementary project. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that Australian soils are relatively ' leaky ' in terms of P in runoff compared to soils overseas. Consequently, comparisons of the labile soil P characteristics and soil P - runoff P relationships were made between Australian soils and soils of similar fertility from the USA, UK and New Zealand ( using both experimental data and data sourced from the literature ). It was concluded that Australian soils leak more P than soils of similar fertility in the USA, UK and New Zealand, although it was beyond the scope of the thesis to make more detailed comparisons between Australian and overseas soils. The accumulation and mobilisation of P in two soils used for intensive pasture production in Australia were investigated. In intensive pasture systems P accumulated in the shallowest zones of the soil and principally as inorganic P. The concentrations of labile P were 3 - 5 times higher in the top 0.01 m than in the top 0.1 m. Using a simple model, it was estimated that only the top several mm of soil influence runoff P concentrations. The dominant form of P in runoff was shown to be orthophosphate although in low to moderate fertility soils, dissolved organic P can constitute a substantial proportion of the P in runoff. These results confirm the need to reduce the pool of P available for mobilisation in the immediate topsoil in order to reduce runoff P concentrations. Because P is stratified, it was hypothesised that one method to reduce the pool of P available for mobilisation is to de - stratify the soil ( i.e. mix the topsoil ). The effect of this technique on runoff P concentrations was investigated in laboratory and rainfall simulation experiments. These experiments revealed that reductions in runoff P concentrations between 45 and 70 % can be achieved by de - stratification of soils under permanent pastures. It was hypothesised that the benefits of de - stratification could be maximised using a combination of information relating to catchment hydrology and the spatial distribution of soil P and that this would result in large reductions in P exports with a relatively small degree of inconvenience to land managers. Given the limited opportunities identified in previous research to reduce P exports in runoff, the strategic utilisation of de - stratification is a potentially important option in water quality management for the dairy industry and warrants further investigation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphorus in agriculture Australia, Southeastern</field><field name="subject">Dairying Environmental aspects Australia, Southeastern</field><field name="subject">Phosphorus Environmental aspects Australia, Southeastern</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HCV infection in South Australian prisoners : prevalence, transmission, risk factors and prospects for harm reduction</field><field name="creator">Miller, Emma Ruth</field><field name="description">This thesis aimed to describe the epidemiology of HCV in South Australian prisons - prevalence, transmission and risk factors. This thesis also aimed to determine the impact of incarceration on reported risk behaviours. A related objective was to evaluate the epidemiological effectiveness of the ELISA - 3 HCV antibody test using PCR as the gold standard. Finally, this thesis aimed to explore the potential for minimising HCV risk in the South Australian prison population.  Methods: Two case note audits were conducted at each of eight publicly operated SA prisons ( in summer and winter ) to identify any documented HCV - antibody test results. Prisoners recruited at entry to prison were offered tests for HCV - antibody and completed a pre - entry risk factor survey. Participants completed additional risk factor surveys and ( if HCV - negative at last test ) underwent further antibody tests at three - monthly intervals for up to 15 months. A sample of participants also provided blood specimens for HCV - RNA testing. Limited stakeholder consultations with prison officers and nurses were also conducted. Quantitative data were analysed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Results: 1347 case notes were audited in summer, and 1347 in winter and an overall HCV prevalence of 42 % was estimated. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, HCV prevalence was significantly higher in female prisoners ( 65 % ), those aged above 28 years ( 48 % ), and in Indigenous prisoners originating from metropolitan areas ( 56 % ). Indigenous prisoners originating from remote areas had significantly lower HCV prevalence ( 20 % ). 666 prisoners were recruited at entry, and 42 % were estimated to be HCV - antibody positive. Three seroconversions were noted in 151 initially HCV - seronegative negative individuals followed up for a median time of 121 days - a rate 4.6 per 100 person years - but community exposure could not be ruled out. Overall agreement between HCV - antibody and HCV - RNA assays was 86 % ( 100% in the HCV negative samples ) - kappa = 0.71.  Injecting history was highly prevalent in prison entrants ( 70 % ) and both community and prison injecting ( but not tattooing ) were independent predictors of entry HCV status. Prison history was also independently associated with entry HCV status. Injecting in prison during the study was infrequently reported, but significantly more likely in those testing HCV - antibody positive at prison entry ( risk ratio = 2.48, P = 0.046 ).  Stakeholders were most supportive of strategies to increase education and to minimise risks associated with hair clippers, but did not support most other suggested preventive strategies. Other issues related to communicable diseases and infection control were explored in the stakeholder interviews. Conclusions: HCV prevalence in South Australian prisoners is extremely high and may have contributed to a ' ceiling effect ' , minimising the seroconversion rate observed in this population. Injecting is relatively infrequently reported in prison, but more likely in those already infected with HCV. Thus, contaminated injecting equipment represents a significant threat to other prisoners and prison staff. Strategies aimed at reducing HCV risk in prisons, which address the concerns of those expected to implement them, are proposed in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hepatitis C virus, prisoners, correctional services</field><field name="subject">Prisoners Health and hygiene South Australia Case studies</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus South Australia Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Congruence properties of linear recurring sequences</field><field name="creator">Crouch, Nicholas Errol</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the behaviour modulo n of linear recurring sequences of integers with characteristic polynomial &#402; ( x ) where n is a positive integer and &#402; ( x ) is a monic polynomial of degree k. Let &#945; [subscript 1], &#945; [subscript 2],...,&#945; [subscript k] be the zeros of &#402; ( x ) and D ( &#402; ) &#8800; 0 its discriminant. We focus on the v-sequence ( v [subscript j] ), defined by v [subscript j] = &#945;[superscript j] over [subscript 1] + &#945; [superscript j] over [subscript 2] + ... + &#945; [superscript j] over [subscript k] for j &#8805; 0. Our main interest is in algebraic congruences modulo n which hold when n is a prime and which involve only terms of the sequence and rational integers. For k = 1,2 such results have been used extensively in primality testing and have led to the study of various types of pseudoprimes. For k = 3, such results have been studied by Adams and Shanks ( 1 ) under the further assumption &#402; ( 0 ) = - 1. For general k, quite different approaches have been taken by Gurak ( 2 ) and Szekeres ( 3 ). The infinite test matrix modulo n is the infinite matrix M with rows and columns numbered 0,1,2 ... whose ( i, j ) entry is m [subscript ij], the least residue modulo n of v [subscript in + j] - v [subscript i + j] for i &#8805; 0 and j &#8805; 0. We study the congruence properties of M and especially of the k x k submatrix M ( [superscript k] ) determined by rows and columns 0 to k - 1. Chapters 1 and 2 introduce the thesis and summarise auxiliary results. Chapter 3 presents background on linear recurring sequences with an emphasis on the matrix approach, including the v - sequence and the k " u - sequences " ( whose initial vectors are the rows of Ik ). Chapter 4 comprises theoretical study of the properties of M for a general k, both when n is a prime and for general n, together with investigation of the condition of Gurak ( 2 ). For ( n, k!D ( &#402; ) ) = 1, we show that the condition of Szekeres is equivalent to the condition that m [subscript i0] = 0 for 1 &#8804; i &#8804; k and also to certain permutation conditions. Gurak ' s condition is then described using these conditions. Chapter 5 assumes k = 3. For this case we study congruences modulo n satisfied by the m [subscript ij] when n is a prime, and hence develop a combination of tests on M ( [superscript 3] ) which are passed by all primes. We report on extensive computer investigation of composites passing these tests. Such composites are found to be rare. Investigation of the relevant work of Adams and Shanks and colleagues, together with use of the permutation condition of Chapter 4, leads to a modification of the earlier tests on M ( [superscript 3] ). Under suitable assumptions we show that the new modified condition is equivalent to the basic condition of Adams and Shanks and also to that of Gurak but has significant advantages over both.

Data have been collected on an almost continuous basis since May 1995 through to May 2000, with observations made whenever the moon was not up.  Techniques and analysis procedures have been developed which allow routine extraction of the parameters of gravity waves observed each night. A cross-spectral analysis was performed on processed data from the photometer to identify short period (less than 3 hours) wave activity on nights where the impact of clouds on the data was minimal. The resulting wave parameters are analysed for seasonal variability and used to build up a climatology of wave parameters over the 5 years of observation. No consistent seasonal variation was observed, although there was a strong eastward perference to the wave's propagation direction. Implications of this finding are discussed.  A co-located MF radar has been operating in spaced antenna mode providing wind data concurrent with the optical observations for most of the acquisition period. When available the wind data allowed calculation of the intrinsic parameters for waves identified in the optical data. The seasonal variablility of these parameters was investigated. An evaluation of energy and momentum fluxes estimated using the method of Swenson et al (1998b) was carried out. Approximations made in this method were found to be inappropriate for the waves detected by the photometer, and a refined procedure was therefore developed. This gave more realistic results, although large number of physically unreasonable momentum flux measurements were reported. Possible reasons for these were explored, and the need for further investigations emphasised.  The five year dataset also allowed investigation of the long-term behaviour of the airglow. Both the intensity and variance were analysed using the Lomb-Scargle method across the complete dataset to identify the dominant periods present. Following similar treatment, the MF spaced antenna winds were compared with the optical results; this utilised a complex spectrum extension to the basic Lomb algorithm. Seasonally related periodicities of two years, one year, one half of a year and one third of a year were observed in the optical data, along with a possible signature of a five and a half year period potentially linked to the eleven year solar cycle. The radar data did not have stong signatures of the one third of a year periodicity although the presence of an five and a half year periodicity could not be ruled out. Gravity wave activity, as measured by the optical intensity variance, reached a maximum during autumn with a secondary maximum occurring in spring. The annual variability of the wave spectrum detected by the photometer was also studied which showed a falloff in the wave energy at short periods (less than thirty minutes) during autumn and spring. This suggested that the enhanced wave activity at these times consisted mainly of waves with periods greater than thirty minutes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atmospheric physics, mesosphere, airflow, radar, winds, gravity waves</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular interactions of latent transforming growth Factor-&#946; binding Protein-2 (LTBP-2) with fibrillins and other extracellular matrix macromolecules [electronic resource]: LTBP-2 competes with LTBP-1 for binding to Fibrillin-1 suggesting that LTBP-2 may modulate latent TGF-&#946; storage</field><field name="creator">Hirani, Rena M</field><field name="description">Elastic fibres, a major component of many connective tissues, are composed of an amorphous elastin core surrounded by fibrillin - containing microfibrils. The function of these microfibrils appears to require the co - ordinated interactions of fibrillins with a range of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) macromolecules including, latent transforming growth factor - &#946; ( TGF - &#946; ) binding proteins ( LTBPs ). LTBPs share a high degree of structural similarity to fibrillins, since they both contain unique 8 - cysteine motifs. Of the four members of the LTBP family, LTBPs - 1, - 3 and - 4 covalently bind to latent forms of TGF - &#946;. LTBP - 1 has been shown to interact with the N - terminal domains of fibrillin - 1 and - 2 and LTBP - 4 interacts with the N - terminal domains of fibrillin - 1, suggesting that fibrillin - containing microfibrils may act as TGF - &#946; stores and localise latent TGF - &#946; complexes to the ECM. LTBP - 2 differs from other members of the LTBP family since it does not covalently bind latent TGF - &#946;. However, LTBP - 2 strongly co - localises with fibrillin - containing microfibrils in a number of tissues suggesting that LTBP - 2 could have a structural role associated with these elements presumably independent of TGF - &#946; storage, or could act to mediate specific microfibril - ECM interactions. To understand more about the function of LTBP - 2, this study involved screening for potentially important molecular interactions of LTBP - 2 with fibrillins and a variety of ECM proteins. Human recombinant LTBP - 2 ( r - LTBP - 2 ) was cloned, expressed and purified using a mammalian cell culture system. Solid phase binding assays were used to screen for interactions between r - LTBP - 2 and continguous fragments of fibrillin - 1 and - 2 as well as MAGPs, tropoelastin, collagens and proteoglycans. A cation dependant interaction was found between the C - terminal domains of LTBP - 2 and the N - terminal domains of fibrillin - 1, but not with the analogous region of fibrillin - 2. Thus, LTBP - 2 seems to have an exclusive role associated with fibrillin - 1 - containing microfibrils. Further studies found that the C - terminal region of LTBP - 2 competes with LTBP - 1 for binding to fibrillin - 1, suggesting that the binding site for LTBP - 2 on fibrillin - 1 is the same or in close proximity to that for LTBP - 1. Immunohistochemical analysis of LTBP - 1 and - 2 within developing human aorta indicated that both LTBPs co - localised with fibrillin - 1. However, the two LTBPs did have distinct distribution patterns in relation to each other, in that LTBP - 2 was found throughout the medial layer whereas LTBP - 1 was mainly located in patches of the outer medial layer. No regions of strong co - localisation of the two LTBPs were found. Thus, these findings suggest that LTBP - 2 could indirectly modulate the presence of TGF - &#946; upon the fibrillin - containing microfibrils by competing for binding with the LTBP- 1 / TGF - &#946; complex to these structures. Other binding studies showed a cation independent interaction between r - LTBP - 2 and an as yet unidentified component of a crude bovine collagen - IV extract. Since collagen - IV is a major component of basement membranes, an interaction between r - LTBP - 2 and a protein within this bovine collagen - IV preparation suggests LTBP - 2 may have a further function involving a basement membrane component. It will be interesting to determine if LTBP - 2 acts as a bridging molecule between basement membrane structures and fibrillin - containing microfibrils or if it has another function independent of these microfibrils.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">latent transforming growth factor, binding proteins</field><field name="subject">Macromolecules</field><field name="subject">Developmental biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discursive analysis of accounts of breast cancer screening, risk and prevention</field><field name="creator">Crabb, Shona Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a discursive analysis of accounts of breast cancer screening, risk and prevention. Breast cancer is currently the largest form of cancer death for women in Australia ( and many other Western nations ), but the causes are unknown. Consequently, health promotion has tended to focus on the early detection of the disease. Despite this focus, the currently available techniques for early detection of breast cancer continue to be subject to research and debate. For women at high risk of the disease due to a family history and, in some cases, a genetic predisposition, there is also discussion regarding the best course of preventative action. One option, prophylactic surgery ( or the removal of healthy breasts ), continues to be the topic of both medical and psychological research. In addition to the ongoing medical research and debate around the topics of breast cancer screening, risk and prevention, there has been extensive sociological theorising around the increased societal emphasis on risk more generally. This emphasis on risk has been argued to be one feature of governance in modern liberal democratic societies. Particularly with respect to health - care in such societies, there has been argued to be a shift towards increasing individual responsibility for health and the management of potential illness. A focus on individual responsibility is not necessarily a key feature of contemporary public health approaches. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that the emphasis on risk management, in combination with the prevalence of ' lifestyle ' diseases, has widened the gaze of public health, such that all aspects of individuals ' lives are open to scrutiny and regulation. An inevitable consequence of such shifts is the placing of increased responsibility for health on to individuals. The analysis in this thesis draws on a synthetic discursive approach to examine talk and text around the issues of breast cancer screening, risk and prevention, in light of these shifts in conceptualisations of health and health - care, and the medical debate surrounding detection and prevention techniques. In particular, three analytic chapters are concerned with three sets of data : media accounts of prophylactic mastectomy ; pamphlets promoting breast cancer screening ; and women ' s focus group talk. The analysis focuses on the discursive themes, ideological dilemmas, and subject positions deployed in the data. The following analytic findings are discussed : - the repeated positioning of individuals as ' patients without symptoms ', who are required to engage in risk management in order to prevent their ( inevitable ) future illness ; - the positioning of women in terms of traditional notions of femininity and mothering ; - the construction of a dilemmatic relationship between individuals and medical experts, whereby individuals are positioned as responsible for their own health and illness prevention, while simultaneously being reliant on medical experts who are sometimes wrong ; - the negotiation and flexible management of notions of responsibility, emotion and health behaviours in women ' s talk. The final chapter in the thesis considers implications of the analysis for public health and health promotion, and for a critical ( public ) health psychology.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast cancer, mastectomy, prophylactic mastectomy, breast surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and nutritive value of lucerne ( Medicago sativa L. ) and Melilotus ( Melilotus albus Medik. ) under saline conditions</field><field name="creator">Guerrero-Rodriguez, Juan de Dios</field><field name="description">Dryland salinity is a major and expanding threat to agricultural land in Australia. Animal production from forages grown on saline land is perhaps its most promising economic use. Glycophytic forage legumes have been evaluated under saline conditions mainly for agronomic characteristics and, to a lesser extent, for nutritive quality to animals. Plant growth and its nutritive quality are interrelated, but a decline in yield in response to salinity may be associated with effects on the chemical constituents of the plant since soil salinity affects plant metabolism. This research aimed to investigate changes in the components of yield and nutritive value of two legumes species. Lucerne ( Medicago sativa ) and Melilotus ( Melilotus albus ) were exposed to different levels of NaCl in the range of 0 to 110 mM NaCl. The research tested the hypothesis that the components of plant nutritive value are not as sensitive to salinity as shoot biomass production since the adaptive mechanisms of the plant lessen harmful effects of the salts. For both plant species, salinity decreased leaf and stem dry matter production, but increased leaf - to - stem ratio. In addition, salinity resulted in earlier flowering in Melilotus. Mineral composition was the most sensitive component of forage quality. Calculated sodium chloride concentrations were up to 125 g / kg DM in lucerne and 39 g / kg DM in Melilotus when irrigated with 110 mM NaCl. The concentrations of calcium and magnesium decreased in both species and approached the marginal range for animal production. Zinc concentration also decreased while potassium decreased in stems of lucerne only. The digestible organic matter ( DOMD ) in response to salinity varied between species. At the highest salt concentration, the whole shoot ( i.e., leaf and stem ) of lucerne decreased up to 4 percentage units while Melilotus increased by 6 percentage units. In lucerne, DOMD was influenced by a high concentration of soluble ash in leaf and stem and, in Melilotus, by an increase in the organic matter content of leaf and a reduction in lignin concentration in stem, which favoured higher digestibility. These results were supported by a histological study in which an increase in starch in Melilotus leaf, and a lower proportion of xylem in relation to parenchyma in stems, was measured. Crude protein concentration was not compromised and, in relation to Melilotus, coumarin concentration did not increase with salinity. In conclusion, the reduction in DM production of species with similar salt tolerance does not necessarily correspond to an equivalent reduction in nutritive value. This research represents the most detailed study into effects of salinity on glycophytic forage legumes. Results show that while some aspects of forage quality ( e.g., minerals composition and energy ) are strongly influenced by salinity, other aspects ( e.g., protein ) remain relatively unaffected. These findings have implications for development of productive grazing systems on saline agricultural land.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">arid regions agriculture, salt-tolerant crops, alfalfa, soil salinization control Australia</field><field name="subject">Arid regions agriculture Australia.

A case-control study</field><field name="creator">Warland, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Title: Is maternal hypotension during pregnancy and/or posterior located placenta associated with increased risk of stillbirth? Design: A retrospective case-controlled study comparing a group of stillbirths with a live born control group matched for maternal age, baby gender, gestational age and year of birth. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether hypotensive women or women with a posterior located placenta are at increased risk of stillbirth. Two Australian tertiary referral obstetric hospitals were chosen as participating hospitals for this study. All cases with a discharge diagnosis of stillbirth over a five year period at these hospitals were identified and considered as cases for inclusion in the study. An attempt was made to match each case with two controls. After exclusions there were 124 cases and 243 controls. Blood pressure (BP) readings throughout pregnancy were extracted from the medical record of each subject, and summary 'exposure' measures were created. These included: diastolic and systolic readings as well as mean arterial pressure taken at the initial (booking BP), minimum, calculated average, and final reading prior to the birth. Placental position, as determined by midtrimester ultrasound, was also collected. Results: This study found that low Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) readings (between 60-70mmHg) throughout pregnancy were associated with a statistically significant increased risk of stillbirth. This trend was seen from the initial reading at booking (OR 1.83 95% CI 1.0-3.2, p=0.03) through to the last taken before the birth (OR 1.53 95% CI 0.9-2.5, p=0.09) including the calculated average over the course of the pregnancy (OR 1.61 95% CI 1.0-2.6, p=0.05) and minimum observed during the pregnancy (OR 2.94 95% CI 0.98-8.8, p=0.05). In addition, this study found a minimum diastolic reading of less than 60mmHg carries a significant risk of stillbirth with a crude odds ratio of 3.5 (95% CI 1.18-10.41, p=0.02). This study did not show a statistically ignificant association of systolic hypotension with stillbirth. However, after combining both systolic and diastolic blood pressures to calculate the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) the analysis did suggest that women with a minimum MAP between 73-83mmHg were at increased risk of stillbirth (OR 1.69 CI 1.02-2.81, p=0.04). Furthermore, this study found that three MAP readings of less than 83.3 during the course of the pregnancy carries almost twice the risk of stillbirth (adjusted OR 1.99) even after adjusting for race, gravidity, parity, BMI and SGA (and matching for maternal age, gestational age, gender and year of birth.) Women who have a posterior located placenta were statistically more likely to suffer a stillbirth than women who had a placenta in any other position (crude OR 1.64) and this estimate was largely unaffected by adjustment for blood pressure and other putative risk factors (adjusted OR 1.67) Conclusion: In conclusion, this is the first study which specifically examined a stillborn population in order to explore whether maternal hypotension and posterior located placenta impact negatively on stillbirth incidence and the results of this study suggest that both maternal hypotension and posterior located placenta are probably independent contributory risk factors for stillbirth. This means that maternity care providers should closely manage and monitor progress of women who are hypotensive during pregnancy or those whose placenta is posterior; and that effective management strategies need to be developed to care for these women.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stillbirth, hypotension, placenta</field><field name="subject">Hypotension.</field><field name="subject">Stillbirth &#8225;z Australia.</field><field name="subject">Placenta.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37872</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cosmic horizons and social voices</field><field name="creator">Warrell, Lindy</field><field name="description">The fieldwork on which this dissertation is based was done in Sri Lanka from 1984 to 1986 when the critique of the of the anthropologist as 'Knower of the Other' was surfacing in the literature (Fabian, 1983, Clifford and Marcus, 1986, Marcus and Fisher 1986). When I returned from the field most works of this genre were generally unknown in Adelaide. However, I began by writing with the insights of Bakhtin who himself had inspired central dimensions of the burgeoning critique of anthropological practice. Like Bakhtin's work, the debates about ethnographic authority continue to invite us to reflect upon the methods employed in the production of any text which claims to define the world of others. It therefore seems appropriate for me to preface this dissertation by highlighting relevant features of the processes which have culminated in this work, Cosmic Horizons and Social Voices. The nature of my fieldwork was distinctive. I did not work in a spatially constrained community. Rather my work was anchored by the work of specialist ritual practitioners, both deity priests and performers. Because the practitioners themselves not only live in dispersed locations but are also highly mobile in relation to the work that they do, my work entailed extensive travel in and between urban centres and rural areas across several provincial divisions. In the course of eighteen months of this kind of fieldwork, I attended in excess of fifty rituals of different types and scale. Over time, I developed personalized networks with more than fifty ritual practitioners privileging me to a broad span of rituals. I worked regularly, and often intimately, with a core of five priests and ten performers to give depth to my understandings. Many of these practitioners appropriated me to themselves at rituals where they publicly announced the purpose of my presence to ritual audiences as being to document Sinhala culture. I was claimed by them as 'our madam' ('ape noona') and as a university lecturer, which they knew very well I was not. This public acknowledgement legitimated my documentation of performances which were, after all, paid for by others. It also had the effect that the sponsors largely treated me as a member of the performing troupe. My growing familiarity with ritual practitioners had the further ramification that some of them insisted that I discuss the meanings of the rituals I documented with those people whom they considered specialists in their field. Soon, therefore, in addition to attending rituals, I spent a great deal of my time entertaining, and being entertained by, ritual specialists with whom I discussed deeper levels of their knowledge and work. In this way, and through my own unique constellation of relationships, I accumulated ritual knowledge, albeit at the theoretical, not practical, level. Some people shared esoteric and valued information with me that they would not disseminate to others with whom they were in competition. This field exercise provided a singular vantage point from which I have interpreted Sinhalese Buddhist ritual practices. While the final selection of rituals interpreted in the dissertation is mine, and represents only aspects	of the larger body of knowledge carried collectively by Sri Lanka's ritual practitioners, the interpretations are based not simply on my observations, but on this body of knowledge which was shared with me even as it was constantly discussed, disputed, disseminated and transformed by ritual practitioners. My understandings of the meanings of ritual were consolidated in both quasi-formal and informal social settings, at my home and theirs, with people renowned as ritual experts by their peers. I collected ritual knowledge like ritual practitioners, in bits and pieces from different people. And, like practitioners who publicly acknowledge only one gurunnanse, I acknowledge mine formally, in the public arena of my own world, in the Introduction. There is another dimension of my field experience that I want to mention before discussing how it was metamorphosed by writing. My three children, Grant, Vanessa and Mark accompanied me to Sri Lanka at the ages of 9, 11 and 12 respectively. Their beautiful, inquisitive and effervescent youth attracted many people to us as a family which meant that they became wonderful sources of new friends and colloquial information. Both of the boys were fascinated with the unique rhythms of Sri Lanka's ritual music and dance and before long, they were keen to learn these for themselves. Grant was deeply disappointed that he could not because, like Vanessa, he was committed to his schooling and, even at 12, he was taller than many of the ritual practitioners. Mark was younger and, in any case, of a much smaller build so he became a pupil of Elaris Weerasingha, a ritual practitioner with international fame, who became my husband. Mark left school to work with Elaris and his sons, often at rituals other than those I attended. With Elaris as his gurunnanse, Mark made his ritual debut just as novice Sinhala performers do. The Sri Lankan press discovered this unique cross-cultural relationship in late December 1986 just as we were preparing to return to Australia. Memorable photographs appeared in both English language and Sinhala papers accompanied by full-page stories praising Elaris for his teaching and acclaiming Mark for proficiency in dance and fluency in Sinhala language and verse. We were delighted. Mark and Elaris continued to perform together in Adelaide at the Festival of Arts, on television and at multicultural art shows before Elaris returned to Sri Lanka to live for family reasons early in 1988. I remember Elaris for both the joy of our union and the pain of our parting. I want to thank him here for sharing his culture with us and especially for the way he supported me to believe in my understandings of the rituals he knew so well. I transcribed my field experience with the help of Bakhtinian insights. The rituals I studied are analysed for their performative value under the heading Cosmic Horizons with faithful reference to what their producers, including Elaris, consider to be one of their most important dimensions if they are to be efficacious; where and when they should occur. I call these facets of ritual their time-space co-ordinates and I employ Bakhtin's conception of the chronotype, in conjunction with practitioner's naming practices, to give them the analytical emphasis they deserve. Using elaborations of ritual meanings articulated to me by ritual specialists and colloquial understandings of words rather than their linguistic etymologies, I variously explore the chronotopic dimensions of the names of supernatural. beings, myths, ritual boundaries and segments to render explicit those unifying symbolic dimensions of a ritual corpus which would otherwise remain implicit to all except ritual practitioners. In particular, the Bakhtinian conceptions I use to analyse ritual serve to reveal and crystallize an integral relationship between the time-space co-ordinates inherent in ritual performance and the oscillations of the sun, moon and earth. Part 1 is my synthesis but it is based on the time-space co-ordinates of ritual; it is deliberately constructionist but it elaborates what I learned from ritual practitioners in the ways I have described. Part 2 is deconstructionist, it is an attempt to represent rituals as events with complex and indirect discursive reference to the elegant symbolic dimensions of the ritual performances themselves. As its title, Social Voices, suggests, Part 2 of the thesis privileges discourse about ritual - by ritual practitioners, ritual sponsors, Buddhist monks, the media and scholars - above the structural symmetry or chronotopic logic of the ritual corpus. It is in this domain, just to offer one example, that religion (agama) is distinguished from culture (sanskruthaiya) and exploited to make value judgements about people's participation in orthodox or unorthodox ritual practices, a judgement which is a possibility of the comic horizons constituted in ritual but which is not, as I argue, determined by them. This dissertation is ultimately an attempt to represent, in written form, fragments of an-Other world through a prosaic Bakhtinian focus on the way particular people named and talked about that world to me. Although I chose not to identify individuals in the text for personal reasons, my methodology is purposeful, giving value to Sinhalese performative ritual as the product of specialist knowledge. And, in keeping with the new imperatives for writing ethnography, this preface describing my field experience is intended to make explicit the way the dissertation explores its foundation in relationships between Self and Other, Observer and Observed, without abrogating the responsibility of authorship. Not pretending to be the voice of the Other, Cosmic Horizons and Social Voices is my voice, echoing the voice of Sri Lanka as it spoke to me.</field><field name="date">1990</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anthropology, Buddhism, rites and ceremonies, Sinhalese (Sri Lankan people)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scheduling and management of real-time communication in point-to-point wide area networks</field><field name="creator">Pope, Cheryl Lynn</field><field name="description">Applications with timing requirements, such as multimedia and live multi-user interaction, are becoming more prevalent in wide area networks. The desire to provide more predictable performance for such applications in packet switched wide area networks is evident in the channel management provided by Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and in the extensions to the Internet protocols proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working groups on integrated and differentiated service. The ability to provide guarantees on the performance of traffic flows, such as packet delay and loss characteristics, relies on an accurate model of the traffic arrival and service at each node in the network.  This thesis surveys the work in bounding packet delay based on various proposed queuing disciplines and proposes a method for more accurately defining the traffic arrival and worst case backlog experienced by packets. The methods are applied to the first in first out (FIFO) queuing discipline to define equations for determining the worst case backlog and queuing delay in multihop networks. Simulation results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of the delay bounds over existing bounds published in the literature. An improvement of two orders of magnitude can be realised for a ten hop path and the improvement increases exponentially with the length of the path for variable rate network traffic. The equations derived in the thesis also take into consideration the effect of jitter on delay, thereby removing the requirement for rate controllers or traffic shaping within the network.  In addition to providing more accurate delay bounds, the problem of providing fault tolerance to channels with guaranteed quality of service (QoS) is also explored. This thesis introduces a method for interleaving resource requirements of backup channels to reduce the overall resource reservations that are required to provide guaranteed fault recovery with the same QoS as the original failed channel. An algorithm for selecting recovery paths that can meet a channel's QoS requirements during recovery is also introduced.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of service, QoS, router scheduling, real time communication</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-employed nurse entrepreneurs expanding the world of nursing practice: a journey of discovery.</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Anne</field><field name="description">Private practice as a career option for nurses has been slowly increasing since the 1980's. However, the reasons for this development have not been fully investigated so that it can be understood and placed within the changing contexts of health care and health services. The expansion and extension of nurses' roles is a contemporary topic in health care reform and therefore one that deserves investigation. The aims of this study were to develop a theory on private practice nursing and to describe the characteristics and work of the self-employed nurse in Australia. Nurses working in a variety of settings have been able to provide information on being self-employed. In doing so, this study was able to describe the persona of the nurse entrepreneur, explore the reasons why nurses and midwives in Australia establish private fee-for-service practices, identify the factors which have influenced this action and describe the scope of practice of nurses and midwives in private practice. This combined Delphi technique and Grounded Theory study is the first in-depth study of Australian nurses and midwives in private practice. The study enables nurses to provide direct information on being self-employed and enhances the profession's ability to articulate about this area of nursing. The significance of the research is in increasing the understanding of this area of practice development and affords greater insight into its efforts to improve and maintain quality nursing services within the Australian health care system. One hundred and six nurses and midwives were invited to participate in the study, in which participants completed two rounds of semi-structured postal questionnaires. Delphi technique was applied to rate responses on Likert scales to ascertain respondents' consensus on certain topics. Participants were also provided the opportunity to make additional comments. Results indicated that nurses in private practice are well experienced with an average of 21 years nursing experience and hold several qualifications. Job satisfaction, being able to be more involved in achieving quality health outcomes and maximising skills and abilities are significant influences for private practice. These results suggest that private practice nursing can contribute effectively to broadening the range of primary health services available to the population and to addressing the issues of retention and recruitment of nurses. Self-employed nurse entrepreneurs push the boundaries of the profession and expand the realm of nursing practice.  Entrepreneurship is a path for the future of nursing as it offers expanded career opportunities for nurses and opportunities for increased ambulatory health services. In addition, the broad, expert knowledge nurses hold on many aspects of health can be disseminated throughout the health sector to the advantage of corporate health partners. There is further development required in this innovative and expanding area of the nursing profession.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nursing Practice Australia, Managed care plans (Medical care) Australia, Nurses Employment Australia, Medical personnel Salaries, etc. Australia, Self-employed Australia Management Employee participation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Workers changing work: the influence of worker power; a longitudinal case study analysis of workplace change at Moving Metals Limited</field><field name="creator">Blewett, Verna Lesley</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the role that shop floor workers play in organisational change. In particular, it investigates the manner in which a distinct group of worker-level leaders and change agents affected the generation and implementation of change and helped to shape the change process in an organisation undergoing planned change. The data for the thesis were obtained from a three-year, longitudinal case-study of organisational change in a medium-sized automotive components manufacturer, Moving Metals Limited (MML). Data were collected at MML during a move from traditional mass production to lean production and the research was conducted using processual action research, while the researcher adopted the dual roles of researcher and consultant to the company. The research identified a distinct group of workers, with no supervisory capacity, who were able to shape the change process in the organisation. These workers are referred to as workers of influence. This group of workers emerged as central characters in the process of organisational change and as leaders and change agents in the organisation. Drawn from the empirical data, criteria for identifying workers of influence are developed in this thesis, based on the authority vested in them by the workforce and their access to management decision-making. A taxonomy of workers of influence is developed in this thesis using these criteria, as well as the duration of tenure of influence. In much of the literature, shop floor workers are portrayed as either passive participants in, or active resistors of organisational change. This research provides evidence of some workers acting as leaders and change agents in an active and influential manner. The research examines issues of power, influence, autonomy and control and their impact on workers' capacity to participate in change. In so doing, this research identifies and opens up an important area of study with implications for organisational theory, literature and the implementation of planned interventions in organisations.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organisational change, management employee participation, industrial relations, employee empowerment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37904</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards cloning the self-incompatibility genes from Phalaris coerulescens</field><field name="creator">Bian, Xue-Yu</field><field name="description">Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important genetic mechanism to prevent the inbreeding of flowering plants and also an excellent system for studying cell-cell recognition and signal transduction. During evolution, several SI systems have been evolved. A unique SI system widely spreads in the grasses. In the grasses, two unlinked, multi-allelic loci (S and Z) determine SI specificity. A putative self-incompatibility gene (Bm2) was previously cloned. In this study, the role of Bm2 in self-incompatibility was investigated first. The cDNA homologues of Bm2 were sequenced from two pollen-only mutants. The results indicated that Bm2 is not the one of SI genes in Phalaris, but represents a subclass of thioredoxin h. Thus a map-based cloning strategy was then adopted to clone the SI genes from Phalaris. Fine linkage maps of the S and Z regions were constructed. RFLP probes from wheat, barley, oat and rye were screened and the S locus was delimited to 0.26 cM and the Z locus to 1.0 cM from one side using specially designed segregating populations. The S locus was located to the sub-centromere region of triticeae chromosome group 1 and the Z locus to the middle of the long arm of group 2. Finally, barley and rice bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to the S and Z region were identified to analyse the chromosome structures and to seek candidate SI genes. The abundant repetitive sequences in the identified barley BAC clones limit their usefulness. Identification of Rice BAC clones orthologous to the S and Z regions open the gate to use rice genome information to clone SI genes from the grasses. A positive rice clone (139.9 kb) orthologous to the S region contained 19 predicted genes. Several of these genes might be involved in pollen tube germination and pollen-stigma interaction, which are the major parts of SI reaction. A positive clone (118.9 kb) orthologous to the Z region gave 16 predicted genes. The predicted genes on the outmost ends of these clones could be used to construct contigs to cover the S and Z regions and delimit the S and Z loci in the grasses.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phalaris genetics, Phalaris pollen, Phalaris coerulescens, distorted segregating mapping, synteny mapping, map-based cloning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Radio variability and interstellar scintillation of blazars</field><field name="creator">Bignall, Hayley Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis presents several observational studies based on radio variability and interstellar scintillation of extragalactic flat-spectrum radio sources. Such sources are commonly called blazars, a term used to describe the phenomenon observed when the jet of a radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) is directed towards the observer. These sources provide unique laboratories for studying the physics of relativistic jets. Observations of selected samples of blazars, made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Australia Telescope Long Baseline Array are presented here. Statistics for long-term (months--years) and short-term (intraday) variability in both total and linearly polarized flux density at several frequencies are presented. The sensitivity and flux density measurement accuracy of the ATCA make it particularly useful for observations of intraday variability (IDV). Resolving the question of what is the mechanism for radio IDV was of great importance at the time this thesis was being undertaken, since if intrinsic, IDV implies extremely high brightness temperatures, far in excess of the Inverse Compton limit for incoherent synchrotron radiation. Most source models are fundamentally based on the assumption that the radiation from radio to optical, and sometimes soft X-ray, energies is produced by the incoherent synchrotron mechanism, so any result which challenges this has serious implications.  There is now strong evidence that interstellar scintillation (ISS) is the principal cause of radio IDV, which substantially lowers the implied source brightness temperatures from those calculated assuming intrinsic variability. Some of the results presented in this thesis have made an important contribution to the paradigm shift from IDV to ISS, by showing unequivocally that the rapid IDV observed in PKS 1257-326 is a result of scintillation due to a nearby scattering screen in the ionised interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy. This unusual source, serendipitously discovered during the course of my PhD, has also proved extremely valuable in showing that ISS can be used as a probe of microarcsecond-scale source structure and also of the local Galactic ISM. Such high angular resolution is not currently achievable even with space interferometer baselines.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">radio astronomy, interferometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adolescents, food behaviour and television</field><field name="creator">Skrzypiec, Grace K</field><field name="description">Several researchers have indicated that the emphasis placed by young people on body shape and appearance has been greatly shaped by the media. The aim of this research was to investigate this notion specifically with regard to televised media. It was hypothesised that there would be a relationship between media images, eating attitudes and dietary behaviours, particularly for teenagers with body-image self-schemas who were conscious of their appearance.  Nine hundred and sixty five senior secondary school students, from 33 country and metropolitan, state and independent, co-educational and single-sex South Australian high schools were surveyed. Fifty-six percent of the sample were adolescent girls and the average age of participants was 16.1 years. The questionnaire included sections on television usage, dieting behaviours, eating restraint and eating habits, as well as attitudes to foods, gender and appearance.  Cluster analysis procedures indicated that it was possible to cluster television viewers into four distinct groups, "Telephiliacs", "Telephobics", "Modellers" and a "Relaxation/Information" group. These groups were classified according to television usage. Telephiliacs made the mose use of television, using it to gain information, for relaxation and entertainment and as a resource for body image and appearance standards; Modellers used it as a guide on which to model their appearance and behaviour; the Relaxation/Information group used it to relax and to gain information; and Telephobics did not watch much television and made the least use of it.  The results of discriminant analyses confirmed that these cluster groups were different and that they could be distinguished by attitudes to appearance, dieting behaviours and foods consumed. The findings support the notion that the adolescent television audience is an active one and that television usage is dependent upon the needs of the individual.  Television usage varied amongst adolescents and it was more likely to be used as a source of reference for body image standards by teenagers who were conscious of their appearance. These teenagers were also more likely to diet. Any outcomes related to television usage were accentuated if teenagers believed that television was "real".  The findings suggest that television perpetuates an image of the thin body ideal and acts as a source of reference for adolescents with body-image self-schemas.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">television and adolescents, adolescent behaviour, teenagers, body image, food habits, food consumption, eating behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving from meat: vegetarianism, beliefs and information sources</field><field name="creator">Lea, Emma J.</field><field name="description">A random population survey (n=601) and a survey of vegetarians (n=106) were conducted to examine South Australians' beliefs about meat and vegetarianism. Meat beliefs, barriers and benefits of vegetarianism, meat consumption, personal values, use of and trust in sources of food/nutrition/health information and demographic variables were measured via a written questionnaire.  There were differences in the responses of vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, and non-vegetarians. For example, vegetarians were more likely than non-vegetarians to use and trust unorthodox information sources and to hold universal values (e.g. 'equality').  The factors associated with meat consumption and four sets of health-related beliefs about meat and vegetarianism (Meat is Necessary, Vegetarianism Health Concerns and Appreciates Meat, Meat is Unhealthy, Health Benefits of Vegetarianism) were examined. Other (health and non-health) beliefs, barriers and benefits of vegetarianism were the most important factors overall to be associated with these beliefs and with meat consumption. Information sources were also associated (particularly orthodox, unorthodox, mass media, advertising, and social sources). Together, these results provided insight into how consumption of meat and plant foods might be influenced.  Finally, the proportion of prospective vegetarians was gauged. Approximately 15% of non-vegetarians were found to hold similar beliefs about vegetarianism as vegetarians. Prospective vegetarians were distinct from vegetarians and the remaining omnivores. For example, they were less likely than the remaining omnivores to eat red meat as frequently or to be Anglo-Australian.  The research suggested that a significant portion of the population is interested in vegetarian diets, but that certain barriers need to be overcome if this is to increase and lead to dietary change; in particular, the beliefs that vegetarian diets are nutritionally inadequate and that meat is essential for health. Tailored communications about how to prepare healthy, tasty vegetarian meals may also be useful. The results indicated the sources of food/nutrition/health information that may be most appropriate to disseminate such messages. Additionally, it was found that ethical (e.g. environmental, animal welfare) issues were linked to health and dietary behaviour. They may need to be more fully addressed by health professionals if the public is to obtain maximum benefit from plant-based diets, with minimum risk.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vegetarian diets, meat industry and trade social aspects, vegetarianism social aspects, nutrition information services social aspects, diet South Australia public opinion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cobalt(II) Catalysts - Their Use in the Enantioselective Ring-opening of 1,2-Dioxines</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Natalie Faye</field><field name="description">A series of new cobalt(II) beta-keto iminato complexes and cobalt(II) salens have been made and the effect of chirality in the northern, southern and peripheral quadrants of these catalysts, with respect to induced enantiomeric excess, during the ring-opening of 1,2-dioxines has been determined. Synthesis of a series of cobalt beta-keto iminato complexes was achieved after modification of literature procedures used for the synthesis of manganese beta-keto iminato complexes and this procedure was applied to generate ligands with ethyl, t-butyl, (-)-bornyl, (+)-menthyl and (-)-menthyl esters and a methyl side chain. Synthesis of the cobalt salens was also achieved using a modified literature procedure, in respect to the more complex aldehydes made. It was ascertained that chirality in the northern quadrant of these catalysts, obtained by the use of optically pure diamines, was of greatest importance in introducing enantiomeric excess into the products of ring-opening of 1,2-dioxines; namely gamma-hydroxy enones, and chirality in the southern and peripheral quadrants was of lesser, although still significant, importance. The reaction conditions were optimised and the conditions under which the highest enantiomeric excess was introduced were determined. The ideal solvent for the ring-opening was found to be THF with a catalyst concentration between 5 and 10 mol% at a temperature of -15oC. These conditions were found to be applicable to all catalysts and 1,2-dioxines tested. Enantiomeric excess as high as 76 % could be introduced when the optimised reaction conditions were used in large scale syntheses of cyclopropane (61). LC-MS studies indicate the presence of a solvent chelated species present in the reaction mixture when the solvent used is THF, however, the use of non-chelating solvents, such as dichloromethane, did not exhibit this same solvent chelated species. Catalyst dimers were also present in the mixture when analysed by LC-MS. The presence of oxygen in the reaction mixture was found to inhibit rearrangement of the dioxine with catalyst oxygen dimers (two molecules of catalyst bound to a single molecule of oxygen) present when analysed by LC-MS, however, the catalyst could be 're-activated' by de-aeration of the solution and was able to introduce the same enantiomeric excess, as prior to the addition of oxygen was unaffected. It was found that not only cobalt(II) tetradentate complexes were useful in the ring-opening of meso 1,2-dioxines. Achiral iron(II) salen and ruthenium(II) salen were also made and shown to be capable of ring-opening the dioxine. A purchased chiral manganese(III) salen was also shown to be capable of ring-opening the 1,2-dioxine, however, the time taken for the rearrangement to occur led to ring closure of the gamma-hydroxy enone and dehydration of the cyclic hemiacetal. The catalysts were also applied to the enantioselective ring-opening of epoxy-1,2-dioxines for the first time with a high level of success with enantiomeric excesses of between 60 and 90 % introduced with most of the catalysts. To show that these catalysts have the potential for use in the synthesis of potentially bioactive cyclopropyl amino acids, amines, acids and alcohols a small number were prepared, including both racemic and optically enriched or optically pure cyclopropanes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cyclopropanes, cobalt beta-keto iminato complexes, cobalt salens, enantiomeric excess, epoxy dioxines</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Switching Black-Scholes Model and Option Pricing</field><field name="creator">Webb, Melanie Ann</field><field name="description">Derivative pricing, and in particular the pricing of options, is an important area of current research in financial mathematics. Experts debate on the best method of pricing and the most appropriate model of a price process to use. In this thesis, a ``Switching Black-Scholes'' model of a price process is proposed. This model is based on the standard geometric Brownian motion (or Black-Scholes) model of a price process. However, the drift and volatility parameters are permitted to vary between a finite number of possible values at known times, according to the state of a hidden Markov chain. This type of model has been found to replicate the Black-Scholes implied volatility smiles observed in the market, and produce option prices which are closer to market values than those obtained from the traditional Black-Scholes formula.  As the Markov chain incorporates a second source of uncertainty into the Black-Scholes model, the Switching Black-Scholes market is incomplete, and no unique option pricing methodology exists. In this thesis, we apply the methods of mean-variance hedging, Esscher transforms and minimum entropy in order to price options on assets which evolve according to the Switching Black-Scholes model. C programs to compute these prices are given, and some particular numerical examples are examined. Finally, filtering techniques and reference probability methods are applied to find estimates of the model parameters and state of the hidden Markov chain.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">finance, Black-Scholes, option pricing, regime switching, hidden markov chain, mean-variance hedging, esscher transforms, entropy, filtering, parameter estimation, derivative pricing, financial mathematics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Medium frequency radar studies of meteors</field><field name="creator">Grant, Stephen Ian</field><field name="description">This thesis details the application of a medium frequency (MF) Doppler radar to observations of meteoroids entering the Earth's atmosphere. MF radars make possible a greater height coverage of the meteor region (70 to 160 km) than conventional meteor radars. However this type of radar has generally been under-utilised for meteor observations, primarily due to the less than ideal radio environment associated with MF systems. This situation demanded selection of the most appropriate radar meteor techniques and in this respect a variety of techniques are evaluated for application at this frequency.  The 2 MHz radar system used in this study is located at the Buckland Park research facility (35.6 deg. S, 138.5 deg. E), near Adelaide, South Australia and is operated by the Department of Physics of the University of Adelaide. This radar has the largest antenna of any MF radar with 89 crossed dipoles distributed over an area of about 1 km in diameter. Beam forming is achieved by varying the phase to groups of elements of the array. The array was constructed in the 1960's, and while having several upgrades, a preliminary examination of the array and associated systems indicated that a significant amount of maintenance work would be required to enable the system to be used for meteor observations. It was also apparent that the software used with the radar hardware for atmospheric studies was not suitable for processing meteor data. Thus a major refurbishment of the radar hardware, as well as the development of appropriate software, was initiated.  The complete radar system was divided into its constituent components of antenna array, transmitter, receiver and computer systems. The transmitter and receiver systems were examined and various improvements made including increasing total output power and enhancing beam steering capability. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques were extensively used on the antenna array, as many feed cables showed the presence of moisture. New hardware in the form of a portable power combining system was designed, constructed and tested to further increase radar experimental capabilities. Techniques were developed that verified system performance was to specification. Extensive night time observations of sporadic and shower meteor events were made over a two and a half year period. A particular study was made of the Orionids shower as well as other meteor activity on the night of 22 October 2000. Using the upgraded beam swinging features of the array, a narrow radar beam was used to track the shower radiant in an orthogonal sense so as to maximise the number of shower meteors detected. From each echo, various intrinsic meteoroid parameters were determined, including meteor reflection point angle-of-arrival using a five-element interferometer, echo duration and height; meteoroid speeds were determined using the Fresnel phase time technique.  Meteor echoes belonging to the Orionids radiant were selected using a coordinate transform technique. The speed was then used as an additional discriminant to confirm the Orionid shower members. A second radiant, observed at a slightly higher declination is classified as also part of the Orionid stream. The sporadic meteor component in the data set was examined and found to exhibit speeds much higher than expected for sporadic meteors at the time of the observations. However, these results are consistent with a selection bias based on meteoroid speed, that is inherent in radar observations.  The Orionid observations indicate that the refurbishment of the radar system and the introduction of new software for meteor analysis has been successfully achieved and that radar meteor studies can now be carried out routinely with the Buckland Park 2 MHz radar. Moreover it has been shown for the first time that meteoroid speeds can be determined with a MF radar operating on a PRF as low as 60 Hz.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">atmospheric physics, meteors, meteor shower, Orionids, radar, radar optimisation, medium frequency, time domain reflectometry, power combiner, interferometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the salient properties of digital imagery that impact on human target acquisition and the implications for image measures.</field><field name="creator">Ewing, Gary John</field><field name="description">Electronically displayed images are becoming increasingly important as an interface between man and information systems. Lengthy periods of intense observation are no longer unusual. There is a growing awareness that specific demands should be made on displayed images in order to achieve an optimum match with the perceptual properties of the human visual system. These demands may vary greatly, depending on the task for which the displayed image is to be used and the ambient conditions. Optimal image specifications are clearly not the same for a home TV, a radar signal monitor or an infrared targeting image display. There is, therefore, a growing need for means of objective measurement of image quality, where "image quality" is used in a very broad sense and is defined in the thesis, but includes any impact of image properties on human performance in relation to specified visual tasks. The aim of this thesis is to consolidate and comment on the image measure literatures, and to find through experiment the salient properties of electronically displayed real world complex imagery that impacts on human performance. These experiments were carried out for well specified visual tasks (of real relevance), and the appropriate application of image measures to this imagery, to predict human performance, was considered. An introduction to certain aspects of image quality measures is given, and clutter metrics are integrated into this concept. A very brief and basic introduction to the human visual system (HVS) is given, with some basic models. The literature on image measures is analysed, with a resulting classification of image measures, according to which features they were attempting to quantify. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of image properties on human performance, using appropriate measures of performance. The concept of image similarity was explored, by objectively measuring the subjective perception of imagery of the same scene, as obtained through different sensors, and which underwent different luminance transformations. Controlled degradations were introduced, by using image compression. Both still and video compression were used to investigate both spatial and temporal aspects of HVS processing. The effects of various compression schemes on human target acquisition performance were quantified. A study was carried out to determine the "local" extent, to which the clutter around a target, affects its detectability. It was found in this case, that the excepted wisdom, of setting the local domain (support of the metric) to twice the expected target size, was incorrect. The local extent of clutter was found to be much greater, with this having implications for the application of clutter metrics. An image quality metric called the gradient energy measure (GEM), for quantifying the affect of filtering on Nuclear Medicine derived images, was developed and evaluated. This proved to be a reliable measure of image smoothing and noise level, which in preliminary studies agreed with human perception. The final study discussed in this thesis determined the performance of human image analysts, in terms of their receiver-operating characteristic, when using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) derived images in the surveillance context. In particular, the effects of target contrast and background clutter on human analyst target detection performance were quantified. In the final chapter, suggestions to extend the work of this thesis are made, and in this context a system to predict human visual performance, based on input imagery, is proposed. This system intelligently uses image metrics based on the particular visual task and human expectations and human visual system performance parameters.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human target acquisition, image quality, image metrics, visual clutter</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new approach to the analysis of the third heart sound</field><field name="creator">Ewing, Gary John</field><field name="description">There has been in the past and still is controversy over the genesis of the third heart sound (S3).

The efficacy of these techniques, in relation to clinical and scientific application, was explored further. Briefly discussed was the application of autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) modelling for spectral analysis of S3, in relation to further work. Following is a brief synopsis of the thesis:  CHAPTER 1 This gives an historical and general introduction to heart sound analysis. Discussed briefly is the physiology of the heart and heart sounds and the diagnostic implications of S3 analysis.  CHAPTER 2 Here is discussed the instrumentation system used and phonocardiographic and echocardiographic data aquisition. Data preprocessing and storage is also covered.  CHAPTER 3 In this chapter the application of a FFT method and correlation of resultant spectral parameters with echocardiographic parameters is reported.  CHAPTER 4 The theoretical development of the maximum entropy technique (based on published papers and expanded) is discussed here. Numerical experiments with the method and associated problems are also discussed.  CHAPTER 5 The MEM is applied to the spectral analysis of S3 and compared with the FFT method. Correlation analysis of MEM derived spectral parameters with echocardiograhic data is performed. CHAPTER 6 Here ARMA modelling and application to further work is discussed. An ARMA model from the maxixum entropy coefficients is derived. The application of this model to the deconvolution of the chest wall transfer function is discussed as an approach for further work.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heart sounds, third heart sound, spectral analysis, maximum entropy spectral analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Loss and Grief in General Practice: The Development and Evaluation of Two Instruments to Detect and Measure Grief in General Practice Patients.</field><field name="creator">Clark, Sheila Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This study has developed and evaluated two instruments, a questionnaire, the Grief Diagnostic Instrument, and an interview, the Grief Diagnostic Interview to detect and measure the extant state of grief in general practice patients. These instruments investigate grief from past, present and impending death and non-death related losses occurring directly to the patient, as well as caused indirectly through experiencing grief in sympathy with the grief of others. The unique feature of these instruments is that they investigate grief from all losses rather than merely a single loss. The questionnaire was demonstrated to be a concise, valid, reliable and sensitive measure, and acceptable to general practice patients. It is suitable for epidemiological studies to detect a broad range of losses and to investigate the prevalence and severity of grief in general practice patients. It is also suitable for comparing the course and severity of grief between losses and identifying commonalities and differences. The interview was found to be an acceptable and valid instrument for undertaking clinical studies. Suggestions for further evaluation of the instruments, and for their uses in grief research and as clinical tools have been proposed. The findings that 2/3 of the general practice population studied were experiencing loss and that over 1/4 of all subjects were suffering moderate or severe grief, demonstrate grief to be a previously unrecognised significant mental health issue for general practice. The most frequently encountered loss categories were 'quality of life', 'death', 'separation' and 'job'. Non-death related losses accounted for 4/5 of all the losses detected. The lack of recognition of grief by subjects was demonstrated, particularly relating to migration and relocation. The hypothesis that loss and grief are under diagnosed and under treated in general practice is supported. This indicates the need for a new paradigm of loss and grief in general practice and for large-scale studies to investigate grief in general practice patients and the detection rate by general practitioners.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Loss, grief, general practice, primary care, diagnosis, grief diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37929</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Self-regulation of the driving behaviour of older drivers</field><field name="creator">Baldock, Matthew Robert Justin</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the extent, and correlates, of self-regulation of driving behaviour among a sample of South Australian older drivers (aged 60 or more). The first of four studies was an analysis of official crash statistics in South Australia over a period of five years. The patterns of crash involvement for South Australian older drivers were found to resemble those reported in the literature for other jurisdictions. Lower levels of crash involvement for older drivers in difficult driving situations (peak hour, rain, darkness) were interpreted as indirect evidence for self-regulation of driving behaviour.	The second study involved pilot testing a measure developed specifically for assessing the visual attention of older adults (the Computerised Visual Attention Test - CVAT). The CVAT assesses visual attention by measuring target detection and reaction time for central and peripheral stimuli, and in conditions requiring selective and divided attention. The third study involved assessing the test-retest reliability, construct validity and predictive validity of the CVAT. It was concluded that the CVAT is a reliable measure of abilities including, but not restricted to, attention, and that it is correlated with on-road driving ability. 	The fourth study involved an examination of the driving behaviour and attitudes of 104 drivers aged over 60, with avoidance of difficult driving situations providing an index of self-regulation. These drivers also completed a battery of tests measuring psychological factors, vision, physical functioning, various cognitive abilities, and attention (the CVAT). Ninety participants additionally completed an on-road assessment of driving ability. It was found that older drivers most often avoided reverse parallel parking and driving at night in the rain, while driving alone was avoided least often. Measures of visual attention, medication use and visual acuity were most predictive of levels of self-regulation, while poorer driving ability was only associated with avoidance of a small number of specific situations. Functional deficits related to poorer driving ability but not to self-regulation included poorer contrast sensitivity, speed of information processing and spatial memory. Such deficits could identify drivers who may need to restrict their driving more than they do.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older drivers, self-regulation, crash involvement, cognition, attention, driving performance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Establishing very low speed, disturbance-free flow for anemometry in turbulent boundary layers</field><field name="creator">Lanspeary, Peter V.</field><field name="description">This document addresses problems encountered when establishing the very low air-flow speeds required for experimental investigations of the mechanisms of low-Reynolds-number boundary-layer turbulence. Small-scale motions in the near-wall region are important features of turbulent boundary-layer dynamics, and, if these features are to be resolved by measurements in air with conventionally-sized hot-wire probes, a well-behaved canonical turbulent boundary layer must be developed at free stream flow speeds no higher than 4 m/s. However, at such low speeds, the turbulent boundary layers developed on the walls of a wind tunnel are very susceptible to perturbation by non-turbulent time-dependent flow structures which originate upstream from the test section in the laminar flow at the inlet and in the contraction.  Four different non-turbulent flow structures have been identified. The first is a result of quasi-two-dimensional separation of the laminar boundary-layer from the surfaces of the wind-tunnel contraction. Potential flow simulations show that susceptibility to this form of separation is reduced by increasing the degree of axisymmetry in the cross-section geometry and by decreasing the streamwise curvature of the concave surfaces. The second source of time-dependence in the laminar boundary-layer flow is an array of weak streamwise vortices produced by Goertler instability. The Goertler vortices can be removed by boundary-layer suction at the contraction exit. The third form of flow perturbation, revealed by visualisation experiments with streamers, is a weak large-scale forced-vortex swirl produced by random spatial fluctuations of temperature at the wind-tunnel inlet. This can be prevented by thorough mixing of the inlet flow; for example, a centrifugal blower installed at the inlet reduces the amplitude of temperature nonuniformity by a factor of about forty and so prevents buoyancy-driven swirl. When subjected to weak pressure gradients near the start of a wind-tunnel contraction, Goertler vortices in laminar wall layers can develop into three-dimensional separations with strong counter-rotating trailing vortices. These trailing vortices are the fourth source of unsteady flow in the test-section. They can be suppressed by a series of appropriately located screens which remove the low-speed-streak precursors of the three-dimensional separations. Elimination of the above four contaminating secondary flows permits the development of a steady uniform downstream flow and well-behaved turbulent wall layers.  Measurements of velocity in the turbulent boundary layer of the test-section have been obtained by hot-wire anemometry. When a hot-wire probe is located within the viscous sublayer, heat transfer from the hot-wire filament to the wall produces significant errors in the measurements of both the mean and the fluctuating velocity components. This error is known as wall-proximity effect and two successful methods are developed for removing it from the hot-wire signal. The first method is based on the observation that, if all experimental parameters except flow speed and distance from the wall are fixed, the velocity error may be expressed nondimensionally as a function of only one parameter, in the form DeltaU^+=f(y^+). The second method, which also accommodates the effect of changing the hot-wire overheat ratio, is based on a dimensional analyis of heat transfer to the wall.  Velocity measurements in the turbulent boundary layer at the mid-plane of a nearly square test-section duct have established that, when the boundary-layer thickness is less than one quarter of the duct height, mean-velocity characteristics are indistinguishable from those of a two-dimensional flat-plate boundary layer. In thicker mid-plane boundary layers, the mean-velocity characteristics are affected by stress-induced secondary flow and by lateral constriction of the boundary-layer wake region. A significant difference between flat-plate and duct boundary layers is also observed in momentum-balance calculations. The momentum-integral equation for a duct requires definitions of momentumd and displacement thickness which are different from those given for flat-plate boundary layers. Momentum-thickness growth rates predicted by the momentum-integral equation for a duct agree closely with measurements of the newly defined duct momentum thickness. Such agreement cannot be obtained in terms of standard flat-plate momentum thickness.  In duct boundary layers with Reynolds numbers Re_theta between 400 and 2600, similarity in the wake-region distributions of streamwise turbulence statistics has been obtained by normalising distance from the wall with the flat-plate momentum thickness, theta_2. This result indicates that, in contrast with the mean velocity characteristics, the structure of mid-plane turbulence does not depend on the proportion of duct cross-section occupied by boundary layers and is essentially the same as in a flat-plate boundary layer. For Reynolds numbers less than 400, both wall-region and wake-region similarity fail because near-wall turbulence events interact strongly with the free stream flow and because large scale turbulence motions are directly influenced by the wall. In these conditions, which exist in both duct and flat-plate turbulent boundary layers, there is no distinct near-wall or wake region, and the behaviour of turbulence throughout the boundary layer depends on both wall variables and on outer region variables simultaneously.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low-speed turbulent boundary layers, wind-tunnel design, wall-proximity effect, hot-wire anemometer, fluid dynamic measurements</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37931</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of a 4BS.4BL-5RL wheat rye translocation to improve copper efficiency of bread wheat</field><field name="creator">Leach, Richard Charles</field><field name="description">Copper deficiency causes significant annual losses in grain yield due to poor grain set. Cereals such as wheat and barley are particularly susceptible to low copper soils whereas,crops such as rye and triticale are better able to grow and yield under such conditions of nutrient stress. The ability of rye and triticale, which carries a complete set of rye chromosomes, to tolerate low copper conditions has been attributed to a gene on rye chromosome 5R. Wheat-rye translocation lines have previously been produced carrying segments of the long arm of chromosome 5 of rye (5RL). Although these lines have expressed copper efficiency in University of Adelaide trials, until now they have been considered agronomically inferior and so have not been used as commercial cultivars. The physical size of rye segment of the 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation in a Chinese Spring background derived from the Cornell Wheat Selection 82a1-2-4-7 was measured using GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) and found to be 16% of the long arm. The size of this translocation was similar to GISH measurements of another 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation in Viking wheat background, although both these lines arose spontaneously and at different times. Molecular maps of both 4BS.4BL-5RL translocations in the two different wheat backgrounds were developed and used to screen for rare recombinants between wheat and rye in a background homozygous for the Sears' ph1b mutant. The maps revealed the approximate genetic location of the translocation breakpoint involved in these two 4BS.4BL-5RL translocations to be similar even though they are known to have arisen at different times and in different experimental populations. The similarity of these translocations suggests a unique property of the region at or near the translocation breakpoint that could be responsible for their similarity and spontaneous formation. After screening 703 critical seedlings for evidence of recombination between the 5RL segment and wheat homoeologues, no confirmed recombinants were identified. Lines containing the 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation were shown to yield equally as well as their recurrent parent under normal field conditions. In addition the presence of the 4BS.4BL-5RL had no adverse effects on a range of grain quality characteristics measured in these lines. A pot trial using lines derived from a cross between the CSHN translocation and the wheat cultivar Warigal (five backcrosses) revealed that they provided copper-efficiency even under the severest of deficiency conditions. While the results of this pot trial did not show the outstanding copper efficiency previously observed in these lines, the translocation did consistently out yield the recurrent parent under severe copper deficiency conditions. Finally, a reliable PCR marker was developed for the rapid identification of lines containing the distal portion of the 5RL chromosome.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">copper in plants, wheat, rye, copper deficiency, copper efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation, regulation and evolutionary analysis of uroplakin 1B: a tetraspanin family member</field><field name="creator">Varga, Andrea Erica</field><field name="description">Uroplakin 1B (UPKIB) is an integral structural protein interacting with uroplakins 1A, 2 and 3 to form hexameric plaques along the bladder lumen in the asymmetric unit membrane of urothelial umbrella cells in humans and other mammals. UPKIB mRNA expression is deregulated in transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs), however the mechanisms of regulation of UPKIB have not been established. Using genome databases, a Xenopus UPKIB homologue was identified. Maximum Parsimony and BAMBE (Bayesian Analysis in Molecular Biology and Evolution) data support a close evolutionary relationship between mammalian and amphibian UPKIB mRNA. Using Unigene, UPKIB human expressed sequence tags were identified in tissues including brain, skeletal muscle and liver, suggesting the relatively widespread distribution of this membrane protein. The UPKIB genomic structure was also deduced using genome databases. Contig AC083800, identified in a high throughput genomic sequence database, spanned UPKIB and 9 exons and 8 introns were defined. A 67bp 5' untranslated region was identified using 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. This product was sequenced and a putative UPKIB promoter and transcription start site was deduced. Contig AC083800 spanned the transcription start site and putative promoter. Transcription factor binding motif prediction programs detected no TATA box, but did predict a CCAAT box and several binding motifs including 4 Sp-1 sites and a NFKB site. A weak CpG island was identified within a 0.5kb region including the putative promoter, exon 1 and intron 1, which was 54% GC rich with CpG:GpC ratio of 0.46, containing 15 CpG dinucleotides. Seven TCC cell lines and five peripheral blood lymphocyte samples were analysed for UPKIB expression using RT-PCR and two cell lines expressed UPKIB transcripts. Eleven CpG sites in the putative promoter were investigated for methylation using bisulfite modification analysis in normal PBL, TCC cell lines and patient TCC samples. An inverse correlation was established in TCC cell lines between UPKIB mRNA expression and degree of methylation. 5-Aza-2'deoxycytidine induced UPKIB mRNA expression in T24 cells, previously observed not to express UPKIB. Sequence analysis of patient samples revealed more complex CpG methylation patterns, reflecting tumour heterogeneity. In summary, the uroplakin 1B gene has been characterised and one mechanism of regulation of gene expression involves methylation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uroplakin 1B, Membrane proteins Genetic aspects, Hematopoiesis Genetic aspects, Methylation, Cell differentiation, Oncogenes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37940</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charters and the Ethics of Conservation: A Cross-Cultural Perspective</field><field name="creator">Rowney, Barry</field><field name="description">The growing realisation of national identity in the face of the threatening envelopment of globalisation has been one major inducement for the increasing practice of conservation of the world's built heritage. This study examines contemporary practices of heritage conservation, analyses their assumptions and theories, and critiques their guiding instruments, the Charters. It adopts a cross-cultural perspective to assess the merits, validity and agency of the most recognised Charters, to discuss their various adaptations, particularly in the Syrian context, and to reveal their Eurocentric focus and indifference to cultural concerns. The study also identifies the inadequacies of the Charters with regard to ethics and morality and proposes a code of ethics for urban conservation. The study focuses on the notion of authenticity that has been an issue of debate since the Nara Conference on Authenticity in 1994. Although arising from, and specifically aimed at, World Heritage Listing, authenticity is recognised as a complex issue dependent on cultural understandings. The study adopts the view that authenticity judgements are linked to a great variety of sources of information, such as form, design, materials, function, traditions, techniques, use, location and spirit that are context-related. It articulates a wide scope for conservation practices at the architectural, urban and archaeological levels, negotiating the breadth and depth of authenticity issues beyond mere fabric and function. The study promotes a dynamic view of authenticity, one that acknowledges socio-cultural change with its inevitable impact on the conditions and conservation of historic environment. The ethical code this study presents places the responsibility on the conservator to ensure the continued conservation and stewardship by the resident society.  The study argues that both the Venice and Burra Charters, being the most recognised conservation instruments, are pitched at individual monuments. It critiques the widely held assumption that maintains applicability of these Charters to area and urban conservation. It draws attention to the paradox that while these Charters address the ethics of conservation their scope are limited to individual buildings, whereas the Charters concerned with urban and area conservation, like the Washington Charter, are inadequate with regards to ethical and cultural issues. By articulating a code of ethics for urban conservation, the study attempts to bridge a significant gap. The study draws on, and contextualises its arguments in, the rich and varied archaeological and urban heritage of Syria, a country that is still coming to terms with the practices, implications and problems of heritage conservation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">historic preservation Syria, architecture conservation and restoration Syria, archaeology conservation and restoration Syria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The automatic design of batch processing systems</field><field name="creator">Dwyer, Barry</field><field name="description">Batch processing is a means of improving the efficiency of transaction processing systems. Despite the maturity of this field, there is no rigorous theory that can assist in the design of batch systems. This thesis proposes such a theory, and shows that it is practical to use it to automate system design. This has important consequences; the main impediment to the wider use of batch systems is the high cost of their development and intenance. The theory is developed twice: informally, in a way that can be used by a systems analyst, and formally, as a result of which a computer program has been developed to prove the feasibility of automated design. Two important concepts are identified, which can aid in the decomposition of any system: 'separability', and 'independence'. Separability is the property that allows processes to be joined together by pipelines or similar topologies. Independence is the property that allows elements of a large set to be accessed and updated independently of one another. Traditional batch processing technology exploits independence when it uses sequential access in preference to random access. It is shown how the same property allows parallel access, resulting in speed gains limited only by the number of processors. This is a useful development that should assist in the design of very high throughput transaction processing systems. Systems are specified procedurally by describing an ideal system, which generates output and updates its internal state immediately following each input event. The derived systems have the same external behaviour as the ideal system except that their outputs and internal states lag those of the ideal system arbitrarily. Indeed, their state variables may have different delays, and the systems as whole may never be in consistent state. A 'state dependency graph' is derived from a static analysis of a specification. The reduced graph of its strongly-connected components defines a canonical process network from which all possible implementations of the system can be derived by composition. From these it is possible to choose the one that minimises any imposed cost function. Although, in general, choosing the optimum design proves to be an NP-complete problem, it is shown that heuristics can find it quickly in practical cases.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">automatic design, batch processing, batch systems, transaction systems, computer systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A triangular grid finite-difference model for wind-induced circulation in shallow lakes</field><field name="creator">McInerney, David John</field><field name="description">In this study, the development and testing of a finite-difference model for wind-induced flow in shallow lakes, and, in particular, a new technique for improving the land--water boundary representation, are documented. The model solves nonlinear, as well as linear, versions of the two-dimensional depth-integrated shallow water equations.  Finite-difference methods on rectangular grids are widely used in numerical models of environmental flows. In these models, land--water boundaries are usually approximated by a series of perpendicular line segments, which enable the impermeability condition to be easily implemented. A disadvantage of this approach is that the actual boundary is often poorly approximated, particularly in regions which have complicated coastlines, and, as a result, currents in these regions cannot be accurately predicted.  A technique for improving the land--water boundary representation in finite-difference models is introduced. This technique permits the model boundary to contain diagonal line segments, in addition to the vertical and horizontal line segments used in traditional models. The new technique is based on a simple concept and can easily be included in existing finite-difference models.  In order to test the new method, the linearised shallow water equations are solved numerically for oscillatory wind-driven flow in lakes with simple geometry. Predictions obtained using the new approach are compared with predictions from the traditional stepped boundary and known analytic solutions. A significant improvement in the accuracy of results is noticed when the new approach is used, particularly in currents close to shore. The increased accuracy obtained using the improved boundary representation can lead to a significant computational saving, when compared with running the rectangular grid model with smaller grid spacings. A second-order analytic solution to the nonlinear shallow water equations is developed for oscillatory wind-driven flow in a rectangular lake. Comparisons between this solution and numerical results, obtained using the traditional stepped boundary and the improved boundary, verify the finite-difference formulae used in these models, including the approximations used for the cross-advective terms close to shore. Once more, currents are predicted with greater accuracy when the new technique for representing the land--water boundary is implemented.  The lake circulation model is applied to the Lower Murray Lakes, South Australia, and predicted water levels at Tauwitchere Barrage are shown to agree very well with observations. The model is then used to examine the effectiveness of two schemes that have been proposed to increase wind-induced circulation, and therefore potentially decrease salinity, in Lake Albert, demonstrating the model's use as an efficient and effective tool for analysing flow behaviour in lakes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">finite-difference, triangular grid, shallow lakes, land-water boundary, wind-driven flow, analytic solution, Lower Murray Lakes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37943</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuous flow rheometry for settling slurries</field><field name="creator">Akroyd, Timothy James</field><field name="description">The rapid settling nature of some industrial mineral slurries can cause problems in the measurement of their rheological properties. To address this problem a flow rheometer based on the principles of helical flow was developed. The rheometer designed, is a modified Couette flow system, whereby slurries are circulated through the concentric cylinders by the addition of an axial flow. The purpose of this axial flow is to prevent particles from settling and to maintain a homogeneous suspension. However, the addition of an axial flow component to Couette flow complicates the analysis procedure for non-Newtonian fluids particularly in wide gap geometries. Thus a specific emphasis in this study was placed on developing a correct analysis procedure for helical flow that eliminated the need for rudimentary calibration procedures. Experimental measurements with different liquids, including those with Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow properties showed good agreement between data obtained from the flow rheometer and data obtained using other standard laboratory instruments. Typical differences between the results from the flow rheometer and results from other laboratory instrument varied between 1-2%, with standard deviations in the flow rheometer data of between 2-4%. The flow properties of several non-Newtonian slow settling slurries were examined using the flow rheometer and also with a specially modified tube rheometer. As with the pure liquid results good agreement was obtained between the results from the flow rheometer and those obtained with the modified tube rheometer. Several rapid settling slurries were examined using the flow rheometer, but due to the rapid settling nature of these slurries they could not be examined with any other laboratory instruments. However, internally consistent results were obtained from different tests with the flow rheometer using different values of axial flow rate. These results demonstrate that the correct data analysis method was developed for the helical flow of non-Newtonian fluids Particle migration is a phenomenon known to affect the results of both rotational and axial flow rheological equipment. Whilst the motion of particles within the helical The University of Adelaide Continuous Flow Rheometry for Settling Slurries flow geometry could not be directly observed, careful examination of the results from several experiments with slurries showed that the effects of particle migration were minimal or non-existent within the flow rheometer. It is presumed that the circulation of the fluid through the geometry minimises the residence time in the geometry, which reduces the likelihood of particle migration. The development of Taylor vortices in a Couette type geometry can cause substantial errors in any rheological measurements. The flow rheometer is based on helical flow, which is a combination of both Couette and axial flow and as such may also suffer from measurement errors if instabilities develop in the flow. A stability criterion for the helical flow of non-Newtonian fluids is therefore required to ensure measurements from the flow rheometer were obtained in the laminar flow region. The stability criterion for laminar Couette flow of a Newtonian fluid was well known, as was the effect of imposing axial flow on Newtonian Couette flow. However, the effect of the rate of acceleration of the inner cylinder and the effect of non-Newtonian fluids on the onset of Taylor vortices was unknown. An increase in the rate of acceleration of the inner cylinder was found to have a destabilising effect on Couette flow. A modified Taylor number was developed for non-Newtonian fluids using the power-law model and was experimentally validated for a range of non-Newtonian fluids. These results were then used to develop a laminar flow stability criterion for rheological measurements of non-Newtonian fluids in the flow rheometer. To test the suitability of the results from the flow rheometer for use in the design and optimisation of process units, the power requirements to turn an impeller in a small baffled mixing vessel were investigated. Good agreement was obtained in the laminar and turbulent flow regions for a variety of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids between measured values of impeller power and those predicted using rheological measurements from the flow rheometer. Altering the density of the solid particles in a slurry is known to affect the overall rheological properties of the slurry. However, the effects of changing the liquid density were not so clearly defined and thus several artificial slurries of PMMA (poly-methylmethacrylate) spheres in water/NaCl and water/glycerol solutions were used to investigate this phenomenon. It was found that the slurry rheology was altered by The University of Adelaide Continuous Flow Rheometry for Settling Slurries changes in the suspending liquid density, however, these changes could be entirely attributed to changes in the liquid viscosity associated with the changes in liquid density. To summarise, the work presented in this Thesis provides a fundamental approach for the absolute measurement of the rheological properties of settling slurries, under conditions that more accurately represent those found in actual mineral processing operations.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rheometers, Rheology Measurement, Slurries</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Form and content in mental representation</field><field name="creator">Simms, Mark Roger</field><field name="description">It is orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of cognitive science to hold that the human brain processes information, both about the body in which the brain is located and about the world more generally. The internal states of the brain that encode this information are known as mental representations. Two matters concerning mental representation are interwoven here: the role of representational content in cognition and the format of mental representation. Robert Cummins, among others, argues that content is intrinsic to mental representation, rather than involving matters external to a representation, such as the use to which the representation is put. He also holds that resemblance accounts of representation best make sense of this fact. Thus, according to Cummins, the content of a mental representation is determined by its form. This thesis argues that an account of representation requiring that representations possess resembling structure is unlikely to be correct given (a) the minimal requirements that something must meet in order to count as a mental representation, (b) the tasks required of representation in cognition, such as capturing abstract properties, combining with other representations, and tracking change, and (c) the possibility that content stands in a different relation to form and cognition from the one Cummins has in mind. In criticising Cummins, however, this thesis explores possible implementations of resemblance theories in connectionist representation. It also redraws his map of the psychosemantic field to suggest that classical theories of cognition, which posit concatenative schemes of symbolic representation, share some of the benefits of tying content to orm. Finally, in exploring various notions of the role of form in representation, this thesis also advocates a pluralistic approach to the mental representations implicated in human cognition.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental representation; knowledge, theory of; cognition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A decent writer: professional environmental communication among environmental managers</field><field name="creator">Boyes, Maria</field><field name="description">The study explores a set of genre-hybrid reviews, 1999-2001, characterised by a standpoint of ecological rationality, and produced by a professional writer for a professional environmental management organisation. The interaction between such managers has not been studied before in terms of professional communication and was delineated as a new field of enquiry. The issues of tact and Face were important for this organisational community, which shared characteristics of contact communities and Communities of Practice. Methods used derive from studies of text in context, and organisational communication. The assembly of theoretical material is one outcome of the study, which tackled three questions: 1 To assess in what way the reviews made a contribution to the organisation, Weick's equivoque and the notion of the Fractal were combined to explain the text as an active organ for collaborative organisational learning and knowledge management. Thereby the texts are presumed to have contributed to the organisation's goal to enhance knowledge and practice in environmental management among managers drawn from diverse intellectual backgrounds. 2 To address the question of the technical characteristics of the reviews, narrative polyphony concepts provided suspension dialogia, which complemented the notion of translation suspension. 3 To address how the reviewer had managed to reproduce organisational patterns despite his inconsistent moral standpoint, the search for a theoretical position travelled through code-switching, pragmatics and translation, emerging with a concept similar to intersemiosis, labelled 'codehandling'. The combination of questions produced complex answers. Translation constructs, such as dynamic equivalence, increasingly emerged as productive and suitable to complement emerging endogenous approaches in environmental management literature. The genre-hybrid is argued to have altered the social function of the review. In prioritising interaction, it put at risk the organisation's strategic tact 10 structure.

In this thesis we present different techniques for network reliability estimation. There are two main sampling techniques in reliability estimation: combinatorial and permutational sampling. Combinatorial sampling has the advantage of speed but has poor performance in rare event simulations. Permutational sampling gives good simulation performance but at a higher computational cost. We combine the two techniques and propose a hybrid sampling scheme called Tree Cut and Merge. By employing simple bounding together with clever conditional sampling, the TCM scheme achieves over 10(superscript 7) times speed up in certain classes of heterogeneous networks. The Crude Monte Carlo (combinatorial) component in the Tree Cut and Merge scheme may cause problems in some situations. In bad cases, the slow convergence problem re-appears. To address the problem, we modifed the scheme by introducing the Importance Sampling technique. The new Tree Cut and Merge with Importance Sampling scheme maintained the speed advantage of the Tree Cut and Merge and minimizes, at the same time, the potential problems caused by the Crude Monte Carlo component. Associated with the Importance Sampling technique, a new technique called the Cross-Entropy method has been developed in the late 90's to find the optimal Importance Sampling parameters. By employing the Cross-Entropy technique, we propose a new scheme called the Merge Process with Cross-Entropy. The new scheme improves the Merge Process in nearly all classes of network; in contrast, Tree Cut and Merge with Importance Sampling scheme sees the greatest improvement in heterogeneous networks. Besides estimating the reliability of a single network, this thesis also investigates a closely related problem: estimating the difference in reliability of two very similar networks. The problem is closely linked to the applications in the areas of network optimization, network evolution, reconfiguration and recovery, for example. The fact that the probabilities of rare events are hard to estimate makes estimating their difference even more difficult. Coupled and differential sampling techniques are proposed and applied to various schemes in this thesis. They prove to be superior to the conventional independent "estimate and subtract" method. Interestingly, these concepts also lead to new ideas regarding the estimation of the reliability of networks that are similar to networks with polynomially computable reliability.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer networks, operations research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of quantum game theory</field><field name="creator">Flitney, Adrian P.</field><field name="description">Quantum game theory is an exciting new topic that combines the physical behaviour of information in quantum mechanical systems with game theory, the mathematical description of conflict and competition situations, to shed new light on the fields of quantum control and quantum information.

Apart from having many practical applications, the theory and approaches prevailing in this area stimulate development of a variety of computational tools and form a ground for testing them. The specific aim of this work is to study two-dimensional laminar boundary layer flows near the leading edges of airfoils and other elongated bodies, and to explore geometries for which boundary layer separation can be avoided. This class of problems is relevant to optimal design of wings, aircraft and projectile noses, laminar flow control methods and adaptive wing technology. One of the findings of this work suggests that local modifications to parabolic wing noses can yield up to 11% increase in the unseparated angle of attack. Another result obtained here is the set of shortest possible generalised elliptic noses of long symmetric bodies which allow unseparated flow. Methods adopted in this work are based on the combined use of numerically solved Prandtl equations written in Gortler variables, and inviscid solutions obtained semi-analytically by the conformal mapping method. The resulting technique being reliable, fast and computationally inexpensive, can complement or test the results obtained using a comprehensive CFD approach.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Boundary-layer flows, leading edges, airfoils, laminar boundary layer mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37960</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of soil and irrigation management on grapevine performance.</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Diane</field><field name="description">The increasing demand worldwide for Australian wine has driven the recent expansion in vineyard plantings which in turn, has increased the requirement for irrigation water in grape growing regions. Large areas of Australia's national vineyard are already irrigated with relatively poor quality water and many districts have a limited supply of water available for irrigation. Therefore, improving the efficiency of vineyard irrigation is essential for the long term sustainability of the Australian wine industry. Reducing the volume of irrigation applied to vineyards can improve water use efficiency (WUE) and reduce vine vigour. However, it can be difficult to accurately apply the required degree of water stress and this may result in a yield reduction. An irrigation technique known as partial rootzone drying (PRD) involves applying a continuous water deficit to alternate sides of the root system while ensuring the other half is well watered. This has been found to increase WUE, reduce vine vigour, improve fruit quality but not affect vine yield. Where the soil volume available for root growth is limited, so too is the resultant vine growth and yield, as access to water and nutrients is restricted. Shallow soil profiles present a major limitation to root development and grapevine vigour. In shallow soils, mounding topsoil from the vineyard mid row to form raised beds in the vine row has been found to improve vine growth and productivity. Soil mounds tend to have a higher moisture holding capacity than flat soil but the greater surface area of the mound can increase surface evaporation. Applying mulch to the mound surface has been shown to reduce evaporative soil moisture loss and conserve irrigation water. The general hypothesis tested in this experiment was that: 'Combining soil mounding, straw mulch and partial rootzone drying (PRD) irrigation will improve grapevine growth and production and reduce levels of sodium and chloride in the vine.' The experiment was established on Vitis vinifera cv. Shiraz in a mature vineyard at Padthaway, South Australia, where the soil profile consisted of a shallow loam over clay and limestone. Soils of the experimental site were classified as moderately saline because their electrical conductivity (ECse) was greater than 4 dS/m. Three main factors, irrigation method (standard or PRD), soil mounding (flat or mounded) and surface cover (bare or straw mulch) were combined into a 2X2X2 factorial experiment such that the randomised block experiment comprised three replicates of eight treatments. The irrigation treatments were control (the application of water to both sides of the vines) and PRD (the application of water to one side of the vines only at any time). In the PRD treatment the frequency of alternating the 'wet' and 'dry' sides was determined according to soil moisture measurements and was typically every 5-7 days. It was very difficult to accurately schedule the irrigation at this site to avoid applying a moisture deficit to the PRD treatment. The shallow soil profile dried very quickly following irrigation and there were problems with the accuracy of the soil moisture sensing equipment for the duration of the experiment. As a result, PRD vines experienced repeated, excessive soil moisture deficits such that vine growth and production were significantly reduced each season. Shoot length was measured weekly during the growing season, while photosynthetically- active radiation (PAR), leaf area and canopy volume were measured at full canopy. Shoot number and pruning weight were measured during dormancy. All measures of vegetative growth (with the exception of PAR) were reduced in response to PRD. The decrease in lateral shoot growth for PRD resulted in greater bunch exposure and PAR. As a direct result of the severe soil moisture deficits experienced by the PRD treatment, all components of yield were significantly reduced compared to the control treatment each season. In particular, bunch weight and berry weight were significantly lower in the PRD treatment compared to the control, which suggests a period(s) of severe soil moisture deficit was experienced. Despite the yield loss sustained by the PRD treatment, WUE was improved compared to the control treatment in the first two years of this experiment. Berry anthocyanin levels were higher for the PRD treatment than the control but this may be due to the reduction in berry size. Weekly volumetric soil moisture monitoring showed that mounded soil was wetter than flat soil each year at similar horizons. In addition, the larger soil volume of the mounded treatment enhanced vine root development. Vegetative growth was greater in the mounded treatment than the flat treatment. Mounded vines grew more shoots than non-mounded vines, although there was no effect of mounding treatment on shoot length. The difference in shoot number was significant only in year 2, possibly due to the time required for vine roots to establish in the mounds. Pruning weight and mean shoot weight were higher for the mounded treatment each year and mounded vines grew more shoots than non-mounded vines in years 1 and 2. The increase in shoot weight of mounded vines, relative to non-mounded, was most likely due to the increase in lateral shoot growth which is supported by the lower PAR values of the mounded treatment compared to the flat treatment. Each year soil mounding resulted in higher vine yields than in flat soil beds as a direct result of the increased vine capacity of mounded vines. The mounded treatment had more shoots per vine than the non-mounded treatment and thus more bunches per vine. In addition, bunch weights were higher in the mounded treatment each year, due mainly to improved fruit set and more berries per bunch. Despite the mounded treatment resulting in a denser canopy than the non-mounded treatment this did not affect fruit composition in years 1 and 2. WUE was higher for the mound treatment in years 2 and 3 only, due to the volume of irrigation water applied being reduced, yet mounded vines continued to produce higher yields than non-mounded vines. In year 3, berries from vines grown in mounded soil had significantly higher pH than berries from vines grown in flat soil beds. Mounding treatment did not consistently affect berry anthocyanin or phenolic levels. Soil moisture levels were higher in the mulch treatment than the bare treatment in all seasons. In contrast to the mounding treatment, wetter soil did not consistently lead to improved vine growth or yield. Mulched vines developed fewer roots than non-mulched vines which is likely to have limited vine access to water and nutrients. As a result, shoot growth was similar for both treatments each season. The only significant difference between treatments for pruning weight was found in year 3 and was due entirely to shoot weight. The mulched treatment had lower PAR than the bare treatment in year 3, probably the result of increased lateral shoot growth and thus increased shoot weight, although this was not significant. PAR was significantly higher for the mulch treatment, compared to the bare treatment, in year 1 only but this was not supported by significant increases in vegetative growth. The mulch treatment resulted in higher vine yield than the non-mulch treatment in years 1 and 3. This difference was significant in year 3 only when both bunch number and bunch weight were significantly higher for mulched vines. In year 1 only bunch weight was significantly higher for mulched vines. Differences between treatments occurred in year 2 for fruit composition, specifically juice TA and anthocyanin levels. The mulch treatment had significantly higher TA and a significantly lower anthocyanin concentration in berries than the non-mulch treatment in year 2. There was no evidence of increased shading in the mulched treatment relative to the bare treatment that year but the difference in anthocyanin concentration may be explained by the significantly smaller berries of the bare treatment. Analysis of samples taken regularly from the soil profile and vine rootzone showed that there was no treatment effect on soil salinity but that soil ECse increased with soil depth and time each year. Petiole samples were collected at flowering, veraison and pre-harvest and levels were deemed toxic by pre-harvest each year. The PRD treatment received approximately 60% of the salt applied to the control treatment. This did not reduce ECse but did result in lower measures of sodium and chloride in petioles and juice at harvest. Vines grown in soil mounds had access to a greater volume of soil water than the non-mounded vines. The mounded treatment had higher levels of pre-harvest petiole chloride in years 1 and 3 but this was significant only in year 3. There was no consistent trend in levels of sodium and chloride in the juice from either mound treatment, although in year 3 berry extract chloride levels were found to be significantly higher in the mounded treatment than the flat treatment. Similarly, a consistent trend in sodium and chloride levels of petioles and juice was not evident for the mulch treatment. Although, in year 3 petioles of vines grown in bare soil were found to contain significantly more petiole chloride than those which had straw mulch applied. The hypothesis that combining soil mounding, straw mulch and partial rootzone drying (PRD) irrigation will improve grapevine growth and production and reduce levels of sodium and chloride in the vine is rejected as there was not a consistent, cumulative effect of the three factors in this experiment.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapes, viticulture, irrigation, plant-water relationships, roots (botany), soil moisture, water efficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a stage model of learning organization development.</field><field name="creator">Sudharatna, Yuraporn</field><field name="description">Becoming a Learning Organization (LO) is widely recognized as a process through which organizations can develop characteristics that enable them to be competitive in an increasingly competitive business environment. While there is an assumption that LOs have the ability to manage change, few empirical studies are available to prove whether an organization with strong LO characteristics also has a high level of change readiness. In developing itself into an LO, an organization seems to gain possession of relevant characteristics through knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization. There is, however, a lack of clarity on what LO characteristics are developed at each of the three stages. The relationship among these stages is also confusing. The purpose of this research is to confirm whether organizations with a high level of LO characteristics also have a high level of readiness-to-change. It also attempts to verify the relationship among the LO development stages of knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization. A questionnaire has been designed following an extensive review. It incorporates "an Inventory of LO Characteristics" to measure the level of LO characteristics formed in an organization. There are also questionnaire to gauge the level readiness-to-change. The questionnaire has been distributed to employees in two leading mobile phone service companies in Thailand. The industry is selected because of its changing business environment. Thailand has been chosen for as the location for the research because few studies in LO have been conducted outside the more developed economies. The findings demonstrate two major insights. Firstly, the correlation coefficient between the six categories of LO characteristics - cultural values, leadership commitment and empowerment, communication, knowledge transfer, employee characteristics and performance upgrading - and readiness-to-change confirms that if an organization has a high level of LO characteristics, it will also have a high level of readiness-to-change. Secondly, the correlation coefficient between the three LO development stages - of knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing and knowledge utilization - and readiness-to-change, support the hypothesis that they follow a sequential order. Results of the research are analysed and discussed, providing valuable contributions to both research and practice in the area.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organizational learning, organizational change, organizational effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing food availability for the endangered south-eastern Red-tailed Black Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne in remnant stringybark woodland, and implications for management.</field><field name="creator">Koch, Paul</field><field name="description">The problems associated with habitat loss and habitat fragmentation are larely responsible for a decline in biodiversity around the world, yet there are relatively few studies targeting declining populations to determine which aspects of resource availability actually limit population size. The endangered south-eastern Red-tailed Black Cockatoo Calyptorhychus banksii graptogyne is highly specialised, feeding almost entirely on seeds of the closely related stringybark eucalypts Eucalyptus arenacea and Eucalyptus baxteri. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the effects of prescribed burns on food availability to the cockatoos. The problem was approached by first, identifying the key components of food availability (capsule quantity, food value per capsule and tree characteristics) influencing the selection of trees and sites for foraging by the cockatoos, and second, by assessing the impact of prescribed burns on these components and levels of habitat use by the cockatoos. The issue of fire management was thus considered in the context of food availability for the cockatoo population, and in relation to other factors such as periodicities between seed crops and edge effects. Phenology was monitored at six sites to assess patterns of seed production for the two species of stringybark, within and between years. Years of high seed production were followed by years of negligible seed production for both species, but the two species did not produce seed crops in the same year. E. baxteri fruited on an approximate two-to-four year cycle while E. arenacea fruited more consistently on a three year cycle. Sightings records for the south-eastern Red-tailed Black Cockatoo population indicated that the cockatoos moved from regions dominated by E. arenacea into those dominated by E. baxteri following the production of a new seed crop on the latter species. These results suggest that the cockatoos fed almost entirely on the species that had fruited most recently, presumably because new seed crops were depleted to a lesser extent than old seed crops. Comparison of various resource characteristics between feed trees and other trees suggested that aspects of capsule quantity such as capsule density (capsules per branch), crop size (capsules per tree) and cluster size (capsules per pedicel) were more important than aspects of capsule profitability (food value per capsule) in determining food supply for the cockatoos. Foraging observations further demonstrated that cockatoos feeding on branches with high capsule density (&gt; 100 capsules per branch) processed 17 % more capsules per unit time than those feeding on branches with low capsule density (&lt; 100 capsules per branch). These results confirmed that the cockatoos forage less efficiently when feeding on branches with low capsule density. Moreover, the percentage of the day spent foraging increased as the seed crop aged from 52 % for February 2001 to 73 % for February 2002 and 88 % for July 2002, suggesting that foraging efficiency declined as the seed crop aged and was depleted. An extensive survey comparing aspects of capsule availability and levels of habitat use between sites varying in time since fire (3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 and &gt; 25 years since fire) was used to assess the effects of prescirbed burns on food availability. The survey indicated that prescribed burns have a prolonged and substantial impact on all measures of capsule availability, with effects lasting approximately ten years. It was estimated that trees burnt in the last ten years produced approximately half as much seed as those in long unburt areas. Correspondingly, the percentage of trees used by cockatoos was much lower in burnt areas thatn unburnt areas, increasing steadily as time since fire progressed. An additional survey comparing measures of capsule availability between trees with different levels of canopy scorch (100 %, 50 %, 10-20 % and unburnt groups) was used to determine the effect of fire intensity on subsequent capsule availability. The standing crop of trees (crop size) was approximately inversely proportional to the percentage of canopy scorched. This finding suggests that reducing canopy scorch by lowering the intensity of prescribed burns is an effective way to reduce the effects of prescribed burns on seed availability to the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo. Comparisons of edge trees with interior trees showed that trees at edges produced approximately twice as many capsules per tree. However, the edge effect was restricted to the outermost fringes of remnants, and the cockatoos only used edge trees slightly more intensively than interior trees, but the effect would provide little compensation for the extensive loss of feeding habitat previously incurred. There was substantial evidence in the present study to suggest that food availability may be limiting the south-eastern Red-tailed Black Cockatoo population. This evidence was as follows : ( 1 ) the high percentage of time spent foraging when compared with other Black Cockatoo species, which increased as the seed crop aged and was depleted ; ( 2 ) the high rates of habitat use ( 100 % of unburnt sites were used by cockatoos ; 64 % of trees were used per site ) : ( 3 ) The use of nearly all burnt sites, despite their generally lower productivity : and ( 4 ) the observation that individual sites were re-visited by flocks of cockatoos several times over the course of the study. Therefore, it is essential that the habitat be managed to maximise seed availability. In particular, the study demonstrated that reducing the intensity of prescribed burns has the potential to significantly increase food supply to the cockatoos. Improvements to fire management, when combined with strategic revegetation programmes, have the potential to secure and improve the conservation status of the endangered south-eastern Red-tailed Black Cockatoo.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Red-tailed Black Cockatoo, Calyptorhynchus banksii graptogyne,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Appetite, food intake and ageing : the role of the gut</field><field name="creator">Parker, Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with gastrointestinal mechanisms and the changes that occur with age that may affect food intake and appetite. Studies are presented that evaluate the contribution of these mechanisms to the control of appetite in older persons. In particular, the use and validation of visual analogue scales in these studies and gastrointestinal aspects of appetite control, the effects of intraduodenal and gastric infusions of fat versus carbohydrate, relationships between gastric antral area and appetite ( using ultrasound measurements ) and the effect of accelerating gastric emptying ( with domperidone ) on appetite and food intake are addressed. Life expectancy is increasing both in Australia and overseas. Many health initiatives focus on decreasing food intake due to the increasing prevalence of obesity in our society, however reduced nutritional intake can also contribute to illness and death in older people. Ageing is associated with changes in gastrointestinal function affecting food intake. The spiralling costs of healthcare highlight the need for promotion and maintenance of healthy lifestyle choices, especially adequate nutritional intake, in older persons. Healthy ageing is associated with decreased appetite and food intake, the so-called ' anorexia of ageing '. This anorexia of ageing is a part of the normal process of ageing in people who do not suffer physical, psychiatric or social disorders. From young to old adult ( 18-70 years ) the average daily food intake falls by approximately 30 %. This reduction is probably in response to a normal decline in activity, however, when our food intake decreases more than our exercise levels weight loss, usually muscle, occurs. Unlike fat, loss of muscle has adverse effects including decreases in strength and increases in falls and fractures, loss of independence and increased risk of protein energy malnutrition, which in turn increases acute and chronic illness, hospitalisation and death. There are many explanations for changes in appetite and food intake in older people including sensory ( taste and smell changes, dental abnormalities ) and social ( poverty, loneliness, institutionalisation ) factors. Appetite regulation in humans is complex. Although many of the mechanisms are unclear, alterations in gastrointestinal responses to food ingestion are important in appetite ( how hungry or full we feel ) and food intake changes with age. Changes occur with increasing age in functions of the stomach and small intestine, including how quickly food and fluids leave the stomach and enter the small intestine to begin digestion, and changes in the way food is distributed and retained within the three sections of the stomach. These changes can influence appetite by increasing fullness and decreasing hunger. In addition, small intestinal hormones associated with appetite regulation increase with age and there is a greater sensitivity to their effects. The interaction of nutrients with gastrointestinal tract receptors stimulates the release of satiety hormones, including cholecystokinin ( CCK ), glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ), gastric inhibitory peptide ( GIP ) and amylin, and inhibits the release of ghrelin, which stimulates feeding. Visual analogue scales ( VAS ) are widely used in appetite research involving adults of all ages, yet the reproducibility and validity of these scales to evaluate appetite has not been assessed in older subjects. In two studies discussed in Chapter 4, retrospective ( to determine the relation of appetite sensations to food intake ) and prospective ( to determine reproducibility ), VAS were evaluated as a measurement of appetite in healthy older subjects. The retrospective study was a combined analysis of four single-blind, randomised, controlled appetite studies undertaken in young and older subjects and the prospective study was an assessment in healthy older men and women aged 65-85 years. Perceptions of appetite ( i.e. hunger and fullness ) were assessed by 100mm visual analogue scales administered at regular intervals. Food intake was quantified from food intake at a test meal. In the retrospective study, food intake at the test meal was positively related to perceptions of hunger, drowsiness, and calmness and inversely related to ratings of fullness taken immediately before the meal in both older and young subjects. In the prospective study, VAS measures of appetite were found to have comparable reproducibility and validity in older subjects to reported values in young adults. These observations confirm that food intake is related to perceptions of hunger and fullness as assessed by VAS in healthy older and young subjects, and suggest that sensations, not obviously associated with appetite, including ' drowsiness ' and ' calmness ', are also associated with food intake. Gastric distension reduces food intake, and antral rather than proximal, gastric distension may be the dominant mechanism in the initiation of appetite-related sensations. To evaluate the age-related changes in appetite, food intake, gastrointestinal hormone concentrations and antral area healthy young and older subjects were administered oral yoghurt preloads and water ( control ) 60 minutes prior to a buffet meal ( Chapter 5 ). Antral area was greater after the nutrient preloads than after water ( P = 0.001 ) and larger in the older than young subjects ( P = 0.005 ). Hunger ( r = -0.59, P &lt; 0.001 ) and food intake ( r = - 0.90, P &lt; 0.001 ) were inversely, and fullness directly ( r = 0.66, P &lt; 0.001 ), related to antral area in both age groups. In healthy older and young subjects the suppression of subsequent food intake was nutrient-dependent and both satiation ( meal termination ) and satiety ( time to subsequent meal consumption ) were related to antral area, and antral distension. The effect of intragastric and intraduodenal administration of macronutrients, such as fat and carbohydrate, on appetite and food intake may be influenced by age. In Chapter 6, intragastric infusions of water ( 0 kcal ), carbohydrate and fat ( both 343 kcal ), were delivered over 5 minutes to older and young men. Food intake was assessed at a buffet meal. Carbohydrate infusion suppressed food intake significantly more than the fat infusion ( 23 v 10 %, P = 0.005 ), and this was so in both young ( 25 v 14 %, P = 0.03 ) and older ( 21 v 7 %, P = 0.05 ) men. These results were compared to equienergetic, equivolaemic fat and carbohydrate solutions delivered into the small intestine of older and young men. Fat inhibited food intake significantly more than carbohydrate in the young men ( 26 v 5 %, P &lt; 0.001 ) whilst the suppressive effects of fat and carbohydrate were similar in the older men ( 21 v 22% , P = 0.05 ). This suggests that with increasing age regional differences in the gastrointestinal tract play both distinct and interacting roles in appetite regulation. Ghrelin is a recently identified peptide hormone secreted primarily from the gastric mucosa. It plays a role in energy balance by stimulating appetite, thereby increasing food intake and enhancing weight gain and fat mass deposition. Plasma ghrelin concentrations increase with fasting and are suppressed by nutrient intake. In Chapter 7, the contribution of both the stomach and small intestine in postprandial suppression of ghrelin was assessed. On three separate days, glucose ( 300 kcal ) and water ( C, 0 kcal ) were infused slowly over 150 minutes into the stomach ( IG ), and an equienergetic infusion of glucose was infused into the small intestine ( ID ) of older men and women. Ghrelin was suppressed following both glucose infusions compared to control ( ID 25 % and IG 19 % v C, P &lt; .00001 ). There was no difference in the degree of suppression between the two glucose infusions ( P = 0.2 ). These results suggest that although the primary source of ghrelin is the gastric mucosa, small intestinal exposure is largely responsible for ghrelin suppression in humans. The effect of age on the suppression of ghrelin in response to nutrient intake is unclear. Domperidone, a prokinetic drug, is a predominantly peripheral acting dopamine2-receptor antagonist known to accelerate gastric emptying. It has been reported to be effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with non-ulcer dyspepsia, Parkinson ' s disease and diabetic gastroparesis. The acute effects of domperidone on perceptions of appetite and food intake in healthy older people may include a reduction in antral distension ( as a result of more rapid gastric emptying and pharmacologically-induced gastric ' relaxation ' ) and meal-related symptoms, and increases food intake at a subsequent meal. In Chapter 8, 10 older men were treated with either domperidone or placebo and food intake, appetite and antral area assessed after a yoghurt preload. There were no differences in appetite scores of food intake between the study days. There was a decrease in antral area and an increase in blood glucose concentrations on the domperidone day, suggesting an increase in gastric emptying, although this difference was not significant. Further studies are required to evaluate the effects of this prokinetic agent on gastric emptying and food intake in older subjects. As the causes of the anorexia of ageing are still largely unknown, the aim of this research was to examine the effects of ageing on appetite, food intake and gastrointestinal function. This research will provide further insight into the ' physiological ' anorexia of ageing and management of the frail elderly, whether resident at home, in acute or long-term care.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aging , appetite</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regolith-landform and mineralogical mapping of the White Dam Prospect, eastern Olary Domain, South Australia, using integrated remote sensing and spectral techniques.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Ian Christopher</field><field name="description">The research contained within this thesis was directed at examining the spectral properties of regolith-dominated terrains using airborne and proximal hyperspectral instruments. The focus of the investigation was to identify the mineralogy of the regolith and determine if surficial materials were indicative of the underlying bedrock in the regolithdominated terrain of the eastern Olary Domain, South Australia. The research area was constrained to a 250 km2 area around the Cu-Au mineralisation of the White Dam Prosect. Integrated remote sensing, using airborne hyperspectral datasets (HyMap), Landsat imagery and gamma-ray spectroscopy data, was performed to map regolith-landforms and extract information on surficial materials. Detailed calibration of the HyMap dataset, using a modified model-based/empirical line calibration technique, was required prior to information extraction. The White Dam area was able to be divided into: alluvial regolith-dominated; in situ regolith-dominated; and bedrock-dominated terrains, based on mineralogical interpretations of the regolith, using the remotely sensed hyperspectral data. Alluvial regions were characterised by large abundances of vegetation and soils with a hematite-rich mineralogy. Highly weathered areas of in situ material were discriminated by the presence of goethite and kaolinite of various crystallinities, whereas the bedrock-dominated regions displayed white mica-/muscovite-rich mineralogy. Areas flanking bedrock exposures commonly consisted of shallow muscovite-rich soils containing regolith carbonate accumulations. Traditional mineral mapping processes were performed on the HyMap data and were able to extract endmembers of regolith and other surficial materials. The Mixture Tuned Matched Filter un-mixing process was successful at classifying regolith materials and minerals. Spectral indices performed on masked data were effective at identifying the key regolith mineralogical features of the HyMap imagery and proved less time consuming than un-mixing processes. Processed HyMap imagery was able to identify weathering halos, highlighted in mineralogical changes, around bedrock exposures. Proximal spectral measurements and XRD analyses of samples collected from the White Dam Prospect were used to create detailed mineralogical dispersion maps of the surface and costean sections. Regolith materials of the logged sections were found to correlate with the spectrally-derived mineral dispersion profiles. The HyLogger drill core scanning instrument was used to examine the mineralogy of the fresh bedrock, which contrasted with the weathering-derived near-surface regolith materials. The overall outcomes of the thesis showed that hyperspectral techniques were useful for charactering the mineralogy of surficial materials and mapping regolith-landforms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">regolith, mines and mineral resources, remote sensing, spectral analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Uptake and partitioning of cadmium in two cultivars of potato ( Solanum tuberosum L. )</field><field name="creator">Dunbar, Kelly R.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the results of an investigation into the uptake and distribution of cadmium (Cd) in two cultivars of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) shown to contain different concentrations of Cd in the tuber at maturity. An initial glasshouse trial sought to determine whether differences in tuber Cd between these two cultivars resulted from differences in uptake from the soil, or were due to differences in the allocation of Cd to the various tissues within the plant. Total uptake of Cd from the soil did not differ between cultivars, nor did the yield of tubers. However, there were marked differences in Cd distribution within the plant. Most of the differences in tuber Cd concentration could be accounted for by a large (3-fold) retention of Cd in the roots of cultivar Wilwash. The concentration of Cd in the shoots of Wilwash was also higher than of Kennebec, although to a lesser extent than the roots. Further studies were conducted to trace the pathways of Cd uptake and movement within the plant. A split-pot trial, involving long-term growth of potatoes in 109Cd-labelled soil, was undertaken to determine the overall pattern of Cd distribution and the importance of the root system in supplying Cd to the tubers. The root system of the potato plant is different to many plants, in that the main root system (basal roots) is augmented after tuber initiation by roots extending from the stolon and from the tuber itself. The basal roots were found to be the dominant source of Cd to all tissues and accounted for approximately 85 % of tuber Cd. The remaining tuber Cd was sourced directly from the stolon and tuber roots. However, there was no evidence of a direct link between the main (basal) root system and the stolons. Although Cd was found to accumulate in the periderm of the tubers, there was no uptake into the tuber tissue itself. Isotopic studies were undertaken to investigate the short-term movement of newly absorbed Cd in the xylem and the phloem. Cadmium was found to be highly mobile in both the xylem and phloem, with added Cd being rapidly assimilated into all tissues following both root and foliar application. Newly absorbed Cd was rapidly sequestered by the stems when applied to either the soil or to a source leaf, suggesting that the stems may act as a transitional storage pool when rapid turnover of nutrients and other mineral elements is required during tuber bulking. Inhibition of Cd uptake by zinc (Zn), has been proposed as a method for reducing the concentration of Cd in various agricultural crops, including potatoes. The ability of Zn to reduce Cd uptake was found to be highly dependent upon cultivar and on the concentration of Cd in the external medium. Although competition between Zn and Cd was found for cultivar Wilwash when the external concentration of Cd was low, when the concentration of Cd in the external media was high, increasing Zn served to increase Cd uptake. Both synergistic and competitive responses were also noted for cultivar Kennebec. However, the patterns of response were opposite to those evident in Wilwash. The complexity of these interactions highlighted the possible shortcomings in using soil applied Zn to limit Cd uptake by potatoes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cadmium, heavy metals, phloem translocation, potato tuber, xylem transport</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictive modelling and experimental studies of thermal inactivation of bacteria as affected by combined temperature and pH in liquid</field><field name="creator">Khoo, Khar Yean</field><field name="description">Continuous thermal pasteurisation of various bulk liquid media is an important step in the food and allied industries. The design of a continuous flow pasteuriser is typically predicated on mathematical models developed from experimental data - usually batch, bench - scale, ethods. Of particular interest is the effect of combined pasteuriser temperature ( T ) and liquid pH on inactivation and survivor of contaminants. However, bench - scale thermal survivor data may not adequately mirror those in a continuous flow pasteuriser. This research presents the development and experimental validation of rigorous models for thermal pasteurisation of bacteria as affected by combined process T - pH in both batch, bench - scale capillary studies ( static ) and in a pilot continuous flow pasteuriser ( dynamic ), within a defined liquid and range of exposure time, temperature and pH ( t - T - pH ). Five integrated stages in synthesis and model analysis were undertaken using stringent criteria for goodness of fit of an adequate model established. First, four published predictive models were assessed against published static data ( n [subscript T] = 248 ) for the thermal inactivation of Escherichia coli ( ATCC 25922 ) in a Carbopol &#174; 941 liquid food simulant in batch capillaries over a range of t - T - pH. The models tested were the Classical Arrhenius, Davey Linear - Arrhenius ( D - LA ), Square - Root ( Belehradek ) and a third - order Polynomial model ( nOP ). Analysis showed the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for model selection and explained 96.0 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. Second, the D - LA model was assessed against limited, published dynamic data ( n [subscript T] = 109 ) for the same E. coli strain in identical food simulant. The model explained 60 % V in the thermal inactivation rate coefficient. On average, model predictions of survivor numbers from the dynamic data were less than that predicted from the static data, i.e. for a given ( t - T - pH ) more bacterial cells were apparently inactivated in the continuous flow pasteuriser than in bench - scale, batch capillary studies. Overall, however it was not clear from extensive analyses of available data whether there is a statistically significant difference in survivor numbers of viable E. coli between batch static and continuous flow dynamic data. Third, although the D - LA model best satisfied the criteria for goodness of fit of a model, it failed to accurately predict the observed tails in the static survivor data. New models ( KDT and a modified KDT ) were synthesised to predict tails and shoulders in survivor data. The modified KDT ( MKDT ) form gave improved predictive capability over the KDT model when assessed against published static survivor data for E. coli and L. monocytogenes ( n [subscript T] = 355 ) in the Carbopol food simulant. This model, however, could not be readily integrated with equations describing the performance of a continuous flow pasteuriser. Analyses indicated that a greater density of dynamic survivor data for E. coli was needed. Fourth, a pilot continuous flow pasteuriser was constructed and used to generate a greater density of dynamic survivor data of E. coli ( ATCC 25922 ) in a Carbopol &#174; 941 carrier liquid for rigorous comparison with predictions from the Lin ( 1976 ) isothermal continuous laminar flow process model. Direct steam injection heating was used. Extensive dye and digital - video studies, in a section of glass holding tube confirmed the practical implementation of the assumptions of laminar flow and rapid condensation of steam. Extensive practical experiments highlighted a non - isothermal condition along the holding tube. A highly linear dependence ( R &#178; &gt; 0.90 ) of exposure temperature with holding tube length, i.e. exposure time, was demonstrated. This was accounted for using mathematical approaches and quantitatively incorporated into a D - LA model for the rate coefficient in an extended Lin process model. A block experimental design of 4 T ( 54, 56, 58, 60 &#176; C ) x 4 pH ( 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 ) x 3 replicates with a total of ( n [subscript T] = 834 ) exposure times ( 16 - 198 s ) was carried out in the pilot continuous flow pasteuriser. Findings highlighted that greater numbers of E. coli were thermally inactivated in the flow pasteuriser than predicted. From a practical operating view, the predictions from the extended Lin model were therefore conservative - with reduced risk to public health. Highly significant differences in the rates of heat - up of bacteria in the pilot pasteuriser ( dynamic ) ( 0.0104 s ) compared with that in the batch ( static ) capillary tubes ( 1.6 s ) and, mode of heat transfer, together with partial effects of dispersion with increasing length of pasteuriser holding tube, are postulated to be the controlling process influences for the difference between the experimental survivor data and the extended Lin model predictions. The lack of agreement between the continuous pasteuriser data and predictions from the extended Lin model indicated that this model cannot be practically applied. A direct comparison of the experimentally derived dynamic survivor data from the pilot pasteuriser ( as ln N / N [subscript 0] ) was also made with both the published static and dynamic data at a number of defined t - T - pH. This comparison revealed that overall, more E. coli were inactivated in the pilot continuous flow pasteuriser than described by published batch static capillary and dynamic data. Importantly, these comparisons showed that batch thermal survivor data for E. coli do not adequately mirror those obtained in continuous flow systems. Fifth, in a search for an improved model for the inactivation data, the newly derived MKDT model was assessed against the experimental pilot pasteuriser data. This model was rejected, however, because it could not account satisfactorily for all tails in survivor curves. A Weibull form model with two coefficients ( a scale factor ( &#945; ) and a shape factor ( &#946; ) ) also did not adequately predict tailing and could not be reliably extrapolated with holding time. However, a modified Weibull form, also with two model coefficients ( &#946; [subscript 0], &#946; [subscript 1] ), did give an improved fit to available experimental data. This research highlighted statistically significant differences between the dynamic thermal survivor data for E. coli and standard bench - scale static capillary data for a defined liquid and range of t - T - pH. It is likely that findings from this study can be generalised. However, validation should be carried out for a range of common indicator micro - organisms in a range of liquid foods.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">food -- microbiology, food -- effect of heat on, sterilization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Penser l'&#233;cran sonore : les th&#233;ories du film parlant</field><field name="creator">McCann, Mark</field><field name="description">The thesis, entitled Penser l'&#233;cran sonore : les th&#233;ories du film parlant ( Thinking the sound screen : theories of the talking film ) aims to provide at once a survey and critique of such theories as have explicitly addressed themselves to film conceived of in its essence as a carrier of acoustically produced meaning. This position would seem to be the merest commonplace, however, review of the literature will show that the study of the cinematic sound object as such was hardly carried out in any systematic manner before the 1980s and the groundbreaking work of Rick Altman, Michel Chion, and Claudia Gorbman. Perhaps the most simple manner of illustrating previous theoretical approaches to this topos would be to indicate the " polar " extremes which mark the limits of the discursive space within which their coverage is inscribed - pessimism and mourning for the silents ( Bal&#225;sz ), dizzying mysticism ( Eisenstein ), Marxian ideological analysis ( Adorno and Eisler ), and various practical suggestions for filmmakers of the type proposed by Reisz and Spottiswoode. The thesis is divided into three along the familiar lines of sound qua sound - concerning that which is valid for all types of sound in the cinema - the voice in cinema, and cinema music. The main approaches to these objects can be similarly broadly characterised as semiological, second - wave semiological, ( i.e. semiology plus psychoanalysis ), cognitivist, and technopragmatic. The intention is to interrogate the merits and the defaults of these approaches by applying them to a range of problematics arising in the three areas listed above. It would of course be ideal if all approaches were to deal with identical questions, however, the internal dynamics of the various methodologies evidently privilege the framing of one question over another : in my opinion this presents its own interest, as the questions which can ( and, perhaps more importantly, cannot ) be posed within a given discursive structure are most revealing of the theoretical framework itself. The importance of cinema sound considered as representation rather than as simple transcription is insisted upon throughout. The limits of multichannelling are established as not greatly extending those already established by stereo. The practice of direct sound - of sound recorded on location or on set in real time - is found to have a distinctly theological dimension. The notion of subjective time as it is experienced by the spectator in the cinema is examined at length. A prominent feminist model of the functioning of sound in the cinema is found to be most unsteady. Finally, an aesthetic of the sound film which utilises the potential of the medium to the highest degree is proposed. A consideration of the lacunae in the field - which remain possibilities for further study - and an extensive bibliography complete the survey.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cinematography, motion pictures, sound effects, acoustics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Myth and alchemy in creative writing: an exegesis accompanying the novel: ' Children of the Earth '</field><field name="creator">Walton, Gwenneth</field><field name="description">The novel Children Of The Earth is about transformation. It uses Ovid's Metamorphoses as a metaphor for the processes which occur in the psyche of each character, and is based on Jungian insights into myth and alchemy. Archetypes that underlie the unconscious processes of all humanity are seen in the symbolism of three very different religious traditions, namely Greek mythology, the Hebrew Old Testament and Australian Aboriginal beliefs. I explore the ways in which these three great mythologies might have converged in colonial South Australia. The story deals with the troubled marriage of isolated settler couple, Hestia and Adam George, and the effects on it of three people who come into their lives. Itinerant German mineralogist Johannes Menge ( based on a real life pioneer ) is a self-taught, eccentric polymath, and a devout but unorthodox exponent of the Bible. In Jungian terms he fulfils the role of an archetypal, but flawed, ' Wise Old Man'. Menge represents nineteenth century Protestantism, albeit still trailing some arcane superstitions. His prot&#233;g&#233;, a disgraced young teacher of classics, calls himself Hermes, and represents the role of Greek mythology in European civilization. Reliving the life of the mercurial god in the antipodes, he becomes messenger, trickster and seducer. Unatildi, an Indigenous girl whom Adam finds in a burnt-out tree trunk, is an archetypal maiden. She introduces the Europeans to the mythology of their new land, as sacred for her people as the Bible is for Johannes Menge. Each of these three characters plays a part in transforming the marriage of Adam and Hestia, and each, in turn, undergoes a personal metamorphosis. Aboriginal women act as midwives at the birth of the love-child of Hestia and Hermes. Named Sophia, after the goddess of wisdom, the new child is thought to have inherited the miwi spirit of Unatildi's lost infant. On his deathbed, as Menge bequeaths his wisdom to his Australian friends, he predicts that Sophia will understand the sacredness of all spiritual life. Eventually Hestia and Adam find themselves changed by their encounters with the archetypes of myth. News of Menge's death on the goldfields gives them the courage they need to begin rebuilding an honest relationship. The novel is 107,400 words in length and is accompanied by an exegesis of 20,170 word, entitled Myth And Alchemy In Creative Writing. The exegesis describes the interactive process of researching and writing, as well as exploring the value of Jungian concepts for creative writing, and current issues of creating Indigenous characters. There is an emphasis on the Jungian approach to mythology and alchemy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">myth in literature, mythology in literature, psychoanalysis and literature, archetype (psychology) in literature, Aboriginal Australians in literature, alchemy in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polar middle atmosphere dynamics</field><field name="creator">Dowdy, Andrew J.</field><field name="description">The dynamics of the polar mesosphere and lower thermosphere ( MLT ) is investigated using MF radars at Davis ( 69 &#176; S, 78 &#176; E ), Syowa ( 69 &#176; S, 40 &#176; E ) and Rothera ( 68 &#176; S, 68 &#176; W ) in the Antarctic, and Poker Flat ( 65 &#176; N, 147 &#176; W ) and Andenes ( 69 &#176; N, 16 &#176; E ) in the Arctic. Mean winds and gravity waves are investigated on a climatological scale and also during sudden stratospheric warmings. Mean wind climatologies in the MLT show differences that are often hemispheric in nature. For example, summer peaks in westward and equatorward winds occur earlier ( closer to the solstice ) in the Antarctic than in the Arctic. The greater symmetry around the solstice of phenomena such as these indicates that radiative effects may play a greater role in controlling the state of the Antarctic MLT than in the Arctic, where dynamical effects might be more important. Gravity wave observations are consistent with this theory, suggesting more wave drag may occur in the Arctic MLT. The equatorward jet persists for about 2 weeks later in summer in the Arctic than in the Antarctic, as do satellite observations of polar mesospheric clouds ( PMCs ) ( a temperature dependent phenomenon ). It is proposed that the meridional winds can be used as a proxy for gravity wave driving and consequent adiabatic cooling in the MLT. VHF radar observations of polar mesospheric summer echoes ( PMSEs ) at Davis, and the satellite PMC observations, both occur at a similar time to the equatorward jet. Seasonal variations in gravity wave activity are generally a combination of annual ( with winter maxima and summer minima ) and semi - annual ( with maxima near the solstices and minima near the equinoxes ) components. The winter maxima and spring / summer minima both occur about 3 weeks later in the Antarctic than in the Arctic, with the difference in magnitude between these extrema being about 90 % larger in the Antarctic. The available MF radar data include six major sudden stratospheric warmings in the northern hemisphere, and the unprecedented southern event which occurred during 2002 splitting the Antarctic ozone hole apart. Three of the six northern events are relatively weak and could almost be classed as minor warmings, while the larger three are similar in strength and duration to the southern event. Gravity wave activity reduces dramatically at Davis during the southern event, but not at Syowa ( possibly due to differences in critical level filtering ). The influence of major warmings on mesospheric gravity wave strength and polarisation varies significantly between locations, and individual events. Zonal wind reversals associated with the large major warmings are all weaker and occur earlier in the mesosphere than in the stratosphere. Another hemispherically common response is zonal wave - 1 planetary wave signatures in the mesospheric meridional winds ( i.e., a flow over the pole ). The planetary wave signatures have 14 - day periodicity and are westward propagating leading up to the southern event. The zonal winds are weaker than average during the 2002 southern winter, and also during the transition to the summer circulation. This is not seen for the large northern major warmings. There appears to be both hemispheric similarities and differences in polar middle atmosphere dynamics during stratospheric warmings, and also on a climatological scale.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">meteorology and atmospheric dynamics, atmosphere observations, polar regions, Antartica Artic regions,</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteoglycans of the human periodontium / Peter Mark Bartold.</field><field name="creator">Bartold, Mark</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographies.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">617.632 599/.019/2456 21</field><field name="subject">Periodontics.</field><field name="subject">Proteoglycans.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Progenitor cells in periodontal ligament / Shin Chyuan Chen.</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shin Chyuan.</field><field name="description">Coursework</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">[Submission for the degree of Doctor of Letters]</field><field name="creator">Forsyth, E.

The areas that have been addressed include : ( i ) the methodological approaches to the evaluation of gastric emptying, blood pressure, splanchnic blood flow, intraluminal manometry and gut hormones and ( ii ) the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying postprandial hypotension, with a particular focus on ' gastric ' and ' small intestinal ' mechanisms and their potential therapeutic relevance. All of the studies have been either published or manuscripts have been prepared for publication. While scintigraphy represents the ' gold standard ' for the measurement of gastric emptying, recent studies suggest that three - dimensional ( 3D ) ultrasonography may also allow a precise measure of gastric emptying. Concurrent scintigraphic and ultrasonographic measurements of gastric emptying of liquids were performed in healthy young volunteers. There was a good correlation and agreement between scintigraphic measurements of gastric emptying and 3D ultrasonography after ingestion of both low - and high - nutrient drinks, indicating that 3D ultrasonography, provides a valid measure of gastric emptying of liquid meals in normal subjects. Postprandial hypotension, defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure of &#8805; 20mmHg,occurring within two hours of a meal is now recognised as an important clinical problem, particularly in the elderly and in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms mediating postprandial hypotension are poorly understood. The effects of variations in concentration of intraduodenal glucose on the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. Blood pressure fell, and heart rate and blood glucose increased over time during infusions, however, there was no difference in blood pressure, heart rate or blood glucose concentrations between the study days. These observations suggest that glucose induced postprandial hypotension is a load rather, than concentration, dependent phenomenon. The effect of meal composition has been reported to influence the hypotensive response to a meal and information relating to the effects of triglyceride and protein on blood pressure is inconsistent. The comparative effects of isocaloric and isovolaemic intraduodenal infusions of glucose, triglyceride and protein on the magnitude of the postprandial fall in blood pressure and rise in heart rate and superior mesenteric artery blood flow were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. There were comparable falls in systolic blood pressure and rises in heart rate, however, the maximum fall in systolic blood pressure occurred later after triglyceride and protein and the stimulation of superior mesenteric artery blood flow was less after protein. These observations suggest that the relatively slower systolic blood pressure response after triglyceride and protein may potentially reflect the time taken for digestion of triglyceride to free fatty acids and protein to amino acids. Acarbose is an antidiabetic drug that slows both gastric emptying and small intestinal glucose absorption. The effects of acarbose, on blood pressure, heart rate, gastric emptying of, and the glycaemic, insulin, glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) and glucosedependent insulinotropic - polypeptide ( GIP ) responses to, an oral sucrose load were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. Acarbose attenuated the fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate induced by oral sucrose. Acarbose slowed gastric emptying and was associated with increased retention in the distal stomach. Stimulation of GLP - 1 may contribute to the slowing of gastric emptying and suppression of postprandial glycaemia by acarbose. These findings suggest that acarbose may represent a therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with postprandial hypotension. Recent studies indicate that gastric distension attenuates the postprandial fall in blood pressure. The effects of gastric distension on blood pressure and heart rate during intraduodenal infusion of glucose at a constant load and concentration were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. Intragastric administration of water markedly attenuated the falls in systolic and diastolic blood pressure induced by intraduodenal glucose. Heart rate increased, with and without gastric distension, in response to intraduodenal glucose infusion but not after intraduodenal saline infusion. This study suggests that gastric distension may potentially be used as a simple adjunctive treatment in the management of postprandial hypotension. Studies employing nitric oxide synthase blockers have established, in animals, that nitric oxide mechanisms are important in the regulation of splanchnic blood flow and, hence, may effect postprandial blood pressure. The role of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG - nitro - L - arginine - methyl - ester ( L - NAME ), on gastric emptying, postprandial blood pressure, plasma insulin concentration and incretin hormone ( ie GIP and GLP - 1 ) release, following an oral glucose load, were evaluated in healthy elderly subjects. L - NAME attenuated the postprandial fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate but had no effect on gastric emptying of glucose. L - NAME attenuated the glucose - induced rise in plasma insulin but had no effect on the incretin ( GIP and GLP - 1 ) hormone response to oral glucose. The study indicates that the magnitude of the fall in blood pressure and increase in heart rate and stimulation of insulin secretion induced by oral glucose in healthy elderly subjects are mediated by nitric oxide mechanisms by an effect unrelated to changes in gastric emptying, or the secretion of GIP and GLP - 1. Studies utilising 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT ) infusions in animals have demonstrated regional variations in intestinal blood flow suggesting a role for 5 - HT in postprandial haemodynamic responses. The effects of the 5 - hydroxytryptamine 3 ( 5 - HT3 ) antagonist, granisetron, on the blood pressure, heart rate, antropyloroduodenal motility and glycaemic responses to intraduodenal glucose infusion were assessed in healthy elderly subjects. Granisetron had no effect on blood pressure, heart rate or antral and pyloric motor responses but modulated the duodenal motor response, to intraduodenal glucose. This study indicates that while the cardiovascular response to intraduodenal glucose does not appear to be influenced by the stimulation of 5 - HT3 receptors, this receptor may be involved in the modulation of the duodenal motor activity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gastric emptying, gastrointestinal system, digestive organs, blood pressure, hypotension in old age,</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system</field><field name="subject">Hypotension</field><field name="subject">Blood pressure Regulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diabetes: the challenge in burns units.</field><field name="creator">Abu-Qamar, Ma'en Zaid</field><field name="description">People with diabetes are at a greater risk of burn injuries than those without diabetes. This stems from the epidemiological profiles of the conditions and the effects of morbidities associated with diabetes. Both conditions share some similarities in terms of metabolic alterations and suboptimal immune functions which may result in poor outcomes for patients. For that reason, it is reasonable to deduce that patients with diabetes are a challenging group to manage in burns units. However, this deduction should be taken cautiously because of lack of supporting evidence. Accordingly and after consulting with clinical experts, the research in this portfolio investigated the association between diabetes and burn injuries. In particular, two different aspects of this association were investigated in two individual quantitative and descriptive inquiries. The first was a case note review of patients hospitalised with a principal diagnosis of a foot burn injury in a large tertiary hospital in South Australia from 1999 to 2004. The second study investigated management of diabetes in burns units treating adults. This study is an e-mail survey of clinical leaders of burns units in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. The clinical leaders were approached indirectly through key liaison persons in each identified unit. In the first study, outcomes for twelve subjects with and fifty-two without diabetes were described using descriptive and non-parametric statistics. In the second study, descriptive frequencies and content analysis were adopted to analyse twenty-nine responses from seventeen out of thirty burns units which participated in the study. Supporting findings in the literature, the first study showed that burn injuries among subjects with diabetes were mainly resulted from household devices. There were no statistically significant differences between subjects with and without diabetes in terms of size and depth of burn injuries and treatment received. In spite of this, there was a statistically significant association between diabetes and the experience of local post-burn complications and longer duration of hospitalisation.  The second study indicated that more than twenty-five percent of the respondents believed that multidisciplinary centres should only occasionally be involved in the process of care. Participants reported that the individual profile of each patient plays a major role in determining the management of diabetes. Additionally, it was found that the insulin sliding scale was commonly used in the management of diabetes in burns units. The association between diabetes and a burn injury is a serious issue in terms of health and cost. This association need be addressed firstly and most importantly at the prevention level; secondly through proper management of both diabetes and burns.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Burns and scalds</field><field name="subject">Foot Blood-vessels Diseases Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes Complications and sequelae</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/38942</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ground based measurements of atmospheric infrared radiation from clear and cloudy skies.</field><field name="creator">Maghrabi, Abdullrahman H.</field><field name="description">This thesis presents results for the infrared (IR) sky temperature measurements using IR thermopile detectors (wavelength peak at 10 &#181;m) at 6 locations around the globe: Adelaide; Australia, Riyadh, Jeddah, Abha and Tabouk; Saudi Arabia, and the Piere Auger observatory site; Argentina. Based on these measurements empirical models for predicting hourly night-time IR sky temperatures clear skies have been developed. These models showed very good performance and better prediction to the measured sky temperatures. Some of these new models showed excellent predictive power for the presence of the cloud over the site. It was found that under some extreme conditions other factors, e.g. aerosols, have great influence on the atmospheric radiation and need to be accounted for. MODTRAN software was used to give the theoretical justifications for the proposed models and was used to investigate some of these factors. A unified model for clear sky temperature from all the sites was found. The applicability of some existing clear sky models to the sites was also tested. While some of them were adequate for estimating IR sky temperatures, others were not.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cortisol perturbation in the pathophysiology of septicaemia, complicated pregnancy and weight loss/obesity.</field><field name="creator">Ho, Jui Ting.</field><field name="description">Cortisol, the principal glucocorticoid secreted from the adrenal glands, is essential for life. Healthy cortisol levels are maintained through negative feedback on the central nervous system (CNS) &#8211; pituitary stimulatory apparatus which regulates production of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and contains a light&#8211;entrained intrinsic CNS driven diurnal rhythm. Cortisol participates in a regulatory mechanism where inflammatory cytokines stimulate cortisol release and cortisol in turn suppresses cytokine release. The effects of cortisol in inflammatory states include elevating blood pressure and metabolic regulation. This thesis contains three exploratory studies examining circulating cortisolaemia using the best available methodologies (total and free cortisol and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)) in clinical states characterized by immune activation/ inflammation and altered blood pressure. These clinical states include: (1) septic shock, (2) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and (3) obesity-induced hypertension. Prior to the studies described here, little was know about cortisolaemia in these common pathological states. Septic shock is a life threatening condition that complicates severe infection and is characterized by systemic inflammation and refractory hypotension. High plasma total cortisol levels and attenuated responses to synthetic ACTH stimulation are associated with increased mortality. The use of corticosteroids in septic shock has been highly controversial for decades, however recent trials have reported haemodynamic and survival benefits associated with the use of physiologic steroid replacement in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) &#8211; currently defined as a total cortisol increment of 248 nmol/L or less following ACTH (250 &#956;g) stimulation. However, CBG and albumin levels fall by around 50% with an increase in plasma free cortisol in critical illness. Hence, total cortisol may not reflect the biologically active free (unbound) cortisol, suggesting that standard assays for plasma cortisol (which measure total plasma cortisol) underestimate HPA axis activity. In this study, we have showed that plasma free cortisol is a better guide to circulating glucocorticoid activity in systemic infection than total cortisol. We have also validated the use of Coolens&#8217; method in estimating free cortisol in systemic infection, using plasma total cortisol and CBG measurements as plasma free cortisol is not performed in clinical laboratories. Free cortisol measurement allows better categorization of RAI and non-RAI groups with a free cortisol increment of 110 nmol/L as cut-off. Moreover, we have shown that survivors of RAI have normal adrenocortical function on follow-up testing suggesting a lack of functional adrenal reserve rather than adrenal damage during critical illness. Larger randomized controlled trials will be required to redefine RAI using free cortisol measurements and relate that to clinical outcomes and responses to corticosteroid therapy. Nitric oxide (NO) is normally produced in the endothelium by the constitutive form of the NO synthase and this physiologic production is important for blood pressure regulation and blood flow distribution. Studies have shown that an overproduction of NO by the inducible form of NO synthase (iNOS) may contribute to the hypotension, cardiodepression and vascular hyporeactivity in septic shock. Clinical studies of non-selective inhibitors of the L-arginine nitric oxide pathway showed increased mortality from cardiovascular complications. However, glucocorticoids, which improve vasopressor sensitivity, may act by partially suppressing NO synthesis through selective direct inhibition of iNOS, and suppression of inflammatory cytokine synthesis. Hence, plasma nitrate/ nitrite (NOx) levels may provide a titratable end point to individualize glucocorticoid therapy in sepsis. The NOx study in this thesis showed that cortisol (total and free), CBG and NOx correlated to illness severity. Free cortisol, and to a lesser extent total cortisol, but not NOx levels, predicted septic shock. NOx levels were characteristically stable within individuals but inter-individual differences were only partly accounted for by illness severity or renal dysfunction. NOx levels correlated weakly with cortisol, did not relate to the need for vasopressors and were not suppressed by hydrocortisone treatment. Thus, NOx is not a suitable target for glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock. Pregnancy is the only sustained physiologic state of hypercortisolism in humans. A large body of data suggests that excessive foetal and prenatal glucocorticoid exposure leads to reduced birth weight and adverse health in offspring such as elevated blood pressure and insulin resistance. Pre-eclampsia and gamete donor pregnancies are associated with immune activation, elevated inflammatory cytokines as well as elevated blood pressure. Prior to the study described in this thesis however, there was no prospective data on maternal cortisolaemia in these complicated pregnancies. My study has demonstrated for the first time that there was a substantial fall in plasma CBG levels in the last few weeks of gestation with a corresponding rise in free cortisol in normal pregnancy, a finding obscured for methodological reasons in past studies. This free cortisol elevation in late pregnancy may facilitate organ maturation in the foetus and perhaps prepare the mother for the metabolic demands of labour. In pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension, plasma CBG, total and free cortisol levels were lower in late third trimester; and in IUGR, plasma CBG levels were suppressed from 28 weeks gestation until delivery but with no significant difference in plasma total and free cortisol. Women with assisted reproduction using donor gametes/ embryos had significantly lower plasma CBG, total and free cortisol levels even in those with normal pregnancy outcomes. Low CBG may be due to reduced synthesis or enhanced inflammation-driven degradation. Low maternal cortisol may be due to a lack of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone, or reduced maternal ACTH, driving cortisol production. This unanticipated maternal hypocortisolism in complicated pregnancies may trigger precocious activation of the foetal HPA axis and could have implications for postnatal and adult health. Speculatively, since excess prenatal GCs increase HPA axis activity, we proposed that maternal hypocortisolism may predispose to the hypocortisolaemic state characterized by fatigue, pain and stress sensitivity, in offspring. The third state of immune/ inflammatory activation associated with blood pressure dysregulation studied in this thesis is obesity. The epidemiologic relationship between obesity and hypertension is widely recognised. Central obesity in particular has been associated with exaggerated HPA responses to stimuli. Studies of severe dieting and starvation resulted in hypercortisolism and a significant decrease in CBG. The HPA axis and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of obesity-induced hypertension. However, there is little data on the effect of moderate weight loss (30% caloric restriction) on adrenocortical function, and the relation of adrenal hormones to altered blood pressure with weight loss. In this study, measures of HPA axis and RAAS and blood pressure monitoring were performed in twenty-five obese subjects before and after a 12-week diet program (6000kJ/day). Short-term, moderate weight loss (mean 8.5 kg) was associated with a small reduction in blood pressure (mean arterial pressure 6 mmHg) and significantly reduced levels of aldosterone and renin but not cortisol levels. These findings suggest that aldosterone may have an important role in the blood pressure reduction with weight loss via a renin mediated mechanism, perhaps involving renal sympathetic tone. In contrast to severe caloric restriction, HPA axis activation does not occur with moderate weight loss. This suggests a threshold effect of weight loss on the HPA axis where greater caloric restriction is required for HPA stimulation, or a counterbalancing of central and direct adrenal effects on HPA axis function. Overall, these three exploratory studies have provided novel data on HPA axis function in systemic infection, pregnancy and in diet-induced weight loss. Each study offers a basis for further studies of HPA axis function in these disorders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cortisol; corticosteroid-binding globulin; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; septicaemia; pregnancy; obesity</field><field name="subject">Hydrocortisone</field><field name="subject">Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</field><field name="subject">Septicemia</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An immunohistochemical study of neurotrophic factors and associated cells in the rat dento-alveolar complex subjected to orthodontic forces.</field><field name="creator">Ho, Shu Hang</field><field name="description">Biological responses to orthodontic forces involve various cell types, these include fibroblasts, endothelial cells, blood vessels and sensory nerves in the periodontal ligament as well as osteoblasts, osteoclasts and cementoblasts in roots and bone surfaces. Neurotrophins are believed to interact with these cells to initiate the process of bone resorption particularly during orthodontic tooth movement. Neuropeptides released from sensory neurons have been shown to modulate the tissue inflammatory responses. In addition, neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), play an important role in neural cell differentiation and survival. The exact localization and function of neurotrophins and neurotrophic receptors in the dento-alveolar complex remains unclear. Moreover, the identity and distribution of structures expressing neurotrophins and neurotrophic receptors has yet to be fully determined. It is reasonable to propose that periodontal ligament and alveolar bone remodelling may be influenced by NGF. In addition, anti-NGF may block neurochemical changes and, hence, inhibit orthodontic tooth movement. The aims of this research were to investigate the cells responsible for NGF secretion within the periodontal ligament (PDL), pulp and bone, and the effect that anti-NGF might have on orthodontic tooth movement. 28, 8 week-old, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into control and experimental groups. Fourteen experimental animals had anti-NGF injected paradentally. Animals were sacrificed at 7 and 14 days. Sections from an earlier study were examined and stained using TRAP for osteoclast identification and analysed histomorphometrically to enable comparisons between control and experimental groups. The findings of this investigation indicated that injections of anti-NGF did not significantly affect the rate of tooth movement with the use of different tooth movement measurement methods. TRAP staining proved to be a useful and reliable marker of osteoclasts. TRAP-positive osteoclastic cells were detected in both anti-NGF and control groups. However, the TRAP-positive cells were not stained intensely with NGF immunolabelling. On the other hand, cells that were stained intensely with NGF, were TRAP-negative. The results suggested that both sympathetic and nociceptive nerves might function in counter balance to modulate bone resorption, and osteoclasts might not be directly responsible for NGF secretion within the PDL and bone. Further studies to determine the effect of NGF on tooth movement are warranted to more clearly identify the NGF expressing cells within the rat dento-alveolar complex and possible role played by NGF in orthodontic tooth movement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthodontic; tooth movement; neurotrophins; rat</field><field name="subject">Neurophysiology.</field><field name="subject">Orthodontics.</field><field name="subject">Rats.</field><field name="subject">Nerve growth factor.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationship of epithelial cells and nerve fibres to experimentally induced dentoalveolar ankylosis in the rat.</field><field name="creator">Di lulio, Darren Scott</field><field name="description">The current study investigated the distribution of periodontal epithelial cells and nerve fibres within the furcations of rat maxillary molar teeth subjected to hypothermic injury. The upper right first molars of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to a single 20 minute application of dry ice in order to produce aseptic necrosis within the periodontal ligament, while the contralateral first molar served as an untreated control. Five animals were each sacrificed via cardiac perfusion after 7, 10, 14, 18, 21 and 28 days respectively and the maxillae were dissected out. After fixation in paraformaldehyde and processing, the tissues were embedded in paraffin wax and cut into 7&#181;m serial coronal sections through the furcation region. Consecutive sections were then stained with H&amp;E, cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and PGP 9.5 immunostains. Light microscopic examination of the H&amp;E stained sections revealed that ankylosis had not developed in all of the experimental teeth, and in some of the observation groups fewer teeth were ankylosed than unaffected. The morphology of the ankylotic areas appeared to change with time, initially consisting of fine bony trabeculae, then progressing to solid bone occupying the entire furcation before becoming less solid again by the latest observation periods. Root resorption was often seen adjacent to areas of ankylosis, but the cementum of the tooth root at the point of ankylotic union was usually intact and free of resorption. Changes within the pulp chambers of the experimental teeth were also noted, with reduction in cellularity and tissue disorganisation initially, then increasing cellularity and formation of a cementum-like material on the chamber walls later. Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostaining successfully identified epithelial cells within the periodontal ligament and their distribution around control teeth was similar to previous reports. Counting of these cells revealed lower numbers around experimental teeth, with the lowest counts around experimental teeth which had developed ankylosis. No change in the epithelial cell counts was detected over time, and these cells did not appear to regenerate after necrosis regardless of whether or not ankylosis developed. Statistical analysis indicated that the probability of ankylosis decreased as the number of epithelial cells increased. The PGP 9.5 immunostain identified periodontal nerve fibres, but the use of this stain was quite technique sensitive. The furcations of the molar teeth were noted to have relatively sparse innervation, with most of the visible nerve fibres being closely associated with blood vessels and located in the outer two-thirds of the ligament. Counting of the nerve fibres revealed fewer fibres around experimental teeth compared to control teeth, especially in the part of the ligament closest to the tooth root. There was no relationship detected between nerve count and time or between nerve and epithelial cell counts. Resorption was found to be more prevalent in experimental teeth, and the probability of resorption in a given tooth decreased as the epithelial cell count increased. The findings of this study suggest that the epithelial cells within the periodontal ligament have a protective function in the prevention of dentoalveolar ankylosis and resorption. Evidence of an intimate interrelationship between periodontal nerve fibre and epithelial cell numbers could not be confirmed. The null hypothesis that epithelial cell rests of Malassez do not provide a protective function against ankylosis and external root resorption was rejected, and the null hypothesis that nerve fibres and epithelial cells are not inter-dependent was retained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epithelial cell rests of malassez; dentoalveolar ankylosis; dental root resorption; peridontal ligament</field><field name="subject">Epithelial cells.</field><field name="subject">Ankylosis.</field><field name="subject">Rats.</field><field name="subject">Teeth--Roots.</field><field name="subject">Periodontal ligament.</field><field name="subject">Resorption (Physiology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/40837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reproductive biology of grapevines: factors that affect flowering and fruitset.</field><field name="creator">Longbottom, Mardi L.</field><field name="description">Molybdenum experiments: In Australia young Merlot vines sometimes suffer from vegetative disorders such as slow, zigzagged growth and leaf distortion. Merlot is also particularly known as a low- and inconsistent-yielding grape variety. Previous research showed that when foliar applications of molybdenum (Mo) were applied to Merlot vines the vegetative symptoms improved. More recently, when sodium molybdate was applied to Mo-deficient Merlot, yield improved; a function of increased bunch weight brought about by bigger berries. It has also been reported that at high concentrations, molybdenum might be detrimental to yield.

Merlot: The aims of the current study were to: a) elucidate the mechanism by which molybdenum affects yield of Merlot; b) to monitor the effects of Mo-treatment on the balance between vine reproductive and vegetative growth; c) to monitor the residual effects of Mo-treatment on growth and yield of Merlot and; d) to determine whether high concentrations of molybdenum are detrimental to yield. Three rates of sodium molybdate were applied to vines in springtime (control = 0g, rate 1 = 0.101g and rate 2 = 0.202g sodium molybdate per vine). Vine molybdenum status was measured prior to treatment and again at flowering time using petiole, shoot tip and inflorescence analysis. The effects on vegetative growth were monitored at veraison, during dormancy and at budburst in the seasons following Mo-treatment. At flowering time, pollen vitality, pollen tube growth and flower structure were examined. Bunch number per vine, fruitset, berry weight and berry composition were measured at harvest. In the Hills, the controls had adequate molybdenum however, at McLaren Vale petiolar molybdenum concentration fell within the suggested deficiency range of 0.05-0.09 mg/kg in the petioles at flowering time. No visual symptoms of Mo-deficiency were observed on the experimental vines. At McLaren Vale, Mo-treatment reduced pruning weight and improved vine balance. Mo-treated vines in the Hills and at McLaren Vale were affected by delayed budburst in the season following Mo-treatment irrespective of their Mo-status. However, no seasonal carryover of molybdenum could be detected in tissue analysis at flowering time. Juice total soluble solids, pH and titratable acidity were not affected by Mo-treatment at McLaren Vale or in the Hills. However, juice from Mo-treated vines in the Hills had a significantly higher concentration of molybdenum than the controls. At McLaren Vale there was no significant difference in juice molybdenum concentration between treatments. In the Hills, yield was not affected by Mo-treatment. However, Mo-treated vines at McLaren Vale had significantly higher yields (approximately double) than the Mo-deficient controls. Bunch number per vine was not affected by Mo-treatment, either in the year that treatments were applied or in the following season. However, bunches from Mo-treated vines had significantly better fruitset resulting in more berries per bunch. Berry weight was affected by Mo-treatment in one season only. Yield was not detrimentally affected on vines that received the higher rate of sodium molybdate. In the Hills, Mo-treatment did not affect pollen numbers, pollen vitality or pollen tube growth. At McLaren Vale, where the controls were Mo-deficient, pollen vitality was not affected by Mo-treatment. However, pollen tube growth was significantly enhanced by Mo-treatment. Significantly more pollen tubes penetrated the ovules from Mo-treated vines and a higher proportion of ovaries had at least one penetrated ovule. Structural observations revealed that a significantly higher proportion of ovules from Mo-deficient vines were defective. The absence of an embryo sac in those ovules is probably the cause of pollen tube growth inhibition and subsequent poor fruitset. Effects of mode of pollination on yield of Merlot and the interacting effects of sodium molybdate sprays: Pollination experiments were conducted on field-grown own-rooted Merlot (clone D3V14) vines in commercial vineyards in the Adelaide Hills and at McLaren Vale in 2003-04 and in 2004-05. Inflorescences were supplied with supplementary Merlot pollen (self-pollination), with pollen from another variety (cross-pollination) or they were left to pollinate naturally (open pollination). In the Hills, mode of pollination did not affect fruitset or berry weight. In 2003-04 fruitset increased significantly at McLaren Vale when inflorescences were cross-pollinated with Semillon. Applying supplementary Merlot pollen also tended to improve fruitset, however none of the treatments affected berry weight. In 2004-05 there was no significant difference between treatments. These results indicate that Merlot may be a poor producer of pollen and may suffer from self-incompatibility. Given the significant improvements in yield gained by spring foliar applications of sodium molybdate to Mo-deficient Merlot vines, in 2005-06 a reciprocal experiment was conducted to separate the effects of Mo-treatment and mode of pollination on the male and female flower parts. The aims of this experiment were to: a) determine whether the male or female reproductive organs are more important in determining the success of fruitset of Merlot and; b) determine which remedial measure, Mo-treatment or pollination, is more effective at overcoming poor fruitset. Supplementary pollination treatments&#8212;cross-pollination (Semillon); self-pollination (Mo-deficient pollen); self-pollination (Mo-treated pollen) and; open-pollination&#8212;were applied to Mo-treated and Mo-deficient vines. Cross-pollinating Mo-deficient vines with Semillon significantly improved fruitset of Merlot compared to other pollination treatments on those vines, however applying molybdenum to the vines in springtime was more effective at improving fruitset. Within the Mo-treated vines the effects of supplementary pollination on fruitset were not thought to be of any practical significance. The results of this experiment provide further evidence that Mo-deficiency affects the female flower parts more than the male reproductive organs of Merlot. The occurrence of &#8216;star&#8217; flowers in Australia: In 2003 faulty flowers were discovered on Canada Muscat grown in the Coombe Vineyard at the University of Adelaide&#8217;s Waite Campus. The Canada Muscat flowers opened from the top in &#8216;star&#8217; formation in contrast to normal grape flowers, which shed the calyptra from its base. Star flowers were reported in French literature in the late 1800s. They were reported to as a symptom of a &#8216;disease&#8217; that caused &#8216;coulure&#8217;, the cure for which was vine removal. The current report is the first known report of star flowers occurring in Australia. Through dissemination of the news of this discovery, several star flower variants were found in other varieties in South Australia. The association of star flowers with poor berry development and the frequency of the occurrence of star flowers suggest that this flower aberration may be affecting yield to a greater extent than previously recognised. This study provides a detailed description of two types of star flowers: those that occur in response to environmental conditions and those that occur every season. Other star flower variants are also documented.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; reproductive biology; Vitis vinifera; Merlot; flowering; pollen tube; ovules, molybdenum; fruitset</field><field name="subject">Grapes Propagation Australia.</field><field name="subject">Plant-breeding Australia.</field><field name="subject">Viticulture Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/41345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological attributes of drought-adaptation and associated molecular markers in the seri/babax hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) population.</field><field name="creator">Olivares-Villegas, Juan Jose</field><field name="description">Agronomic and physiological traits associated with drought adaptation were assessed within the Seri/Babax recombinant inbred line population, derived from parents similar in height and maturity but divergent in their sensitivity to drought.  Field trials under different water regimes were conducted over three years in Mexico and under rainfed conditions in Australia.  Under drought, canopy temperature (CT) was the single-most drought-adaptive trait contributing to a higher performance (R2= 0.71, p&lt;0.0001), highly heritable (h2= 0.65, p&lt;0.0001) and consistently associated with yield phenotypically (r= -0.75, p&lt;0.0001) and genetically [R(g)= -0.95, p&lt;0.0001]. CT epitomises a mechanism of dehydration avoidance expressed throughout the growing season and across latitudes, which can be utilised as a selection criteria to identify high-yielding wheat genotypes or as an important predictor of yield performance under drought. Early response under drought, suggested by a high association of CT with estimates of biomass at booting (r= -0.44, p&lt;0.0001), leaf chlorophyll (r= -0.22,p&lt;0.0001) and plant height (r= -0.64, p&lt;0.0001), contrast with the small relationships with anthesis and maturity (averaged, r= -0.10, p&lt;0.0001), and with osmotic potential (r= -0.20, p&lt;0.0001). Results suggest that the ability to extract water from the soil under increasing soil water deficit is a major attribute of drought adaptation.  Ample genetic variation and significant transgressive segregation under drought suggested a polygenic governance feasible of dissection via molecular markers of CT and associated physiological and agronomic traits. Bulked segregant analysis of selected secondary traits was utilised as an alternative to complete genome mapping, due to a low polymorphism (27%) within the cross and limited chromosomic linkage of loci. The assessment of the extremes of expression in a genotypic subset with a composite molecular database of 127 markers (PCR-based and AFLPs) allowed evaluation of the three hexaploid wheat genomes and coverage of all chromosomic groups, except 3D. One-way analysis of variance indicated significant associations of loci explaining phenotypic variance under drought and rainfed conditions, of 20-70% in Mexico and 20-45% in Australia (F&gt;5.00, p&lt;0.05).  Significant loci were established in both latitudes for all physiological and agronomic traits assessed via BSA, with CT being the trait with the most numerous associations (in Mexico, 34 loci; in Australia, 24).  Results demonstrate an efficient development of molecular markers associated to physiological traits under specific soil water conditions in Mexico and Australia, and suggest further genomic and transcriptomic studies be conducted for unravelling the complex relationship between drought adaptation and performance under drought.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drought adaptation, canopy temperature, physiological breeding, yield potential, bulked segregant analysis, molecular markers</field><field name="subject">Wheat Physiology.

In particular, the thesis begins with development of a technique using ultrasonic backscatter analyses to quantitate the early stages of aortic stenosis. Subsequent chapters utilized this methodology to quantitate aortic valve structural changes in a model and intervention study of aortic stenosis in rabbits. The last chapters are human studies designed to identify factors associated with presence of aortic sclerosis/stenosis; with particular interest in potential association of endothelial dysfunction/inflammation/platelet aggregation with abnormal aortic valve structure quantitated by ultrasonic backscatter. In Chapter 1 (Introduction) the relevant literature is reviewed. Development of ultrasonic backscatter to quantitate aortic sclerosis (Chapter 2) Aortic valve sclerosis (ASc) is detected when there is visual assessment of focal increases in echogenicity of the aortic valve most commonly assessed by echocardiography. However, there is no previously described method to quantitate degree of aortic valve structural abnormality as ASc is not associated with marked hemodynamic obstruction quantifiable by Doppler echocardiography. The current study used ultrasonic backscatter to quantitate aortic valve structural abnormality in patients assessed as having ASc based on valve appearances, compared to young healthy volunteers with normal aortic valves. The results of the study indicate: 1) that the mean levels of aortic valve backscatter in ASc patients are approximately 60% greater than in young healthy volunteers (ie aortic valve backscatter scores &#8805; 16dB are not consistent with normal aortic valve structure), 2) ultrasonic backscatter scores in ASc patients are directly correlated with subjective scoring of sclerosis and with a positive trend with transvalvular pressure gradients in patients with mild-moderate aortic stenosis, and most importantly, 3) ultrasonic backscatter is a reproducible technique, with mean differences between estimates based on repeat echocardiograms of 2.3 &#177; 1.7 (9.1%). These results indicate that ultrasonic backscatter could be used as a quantitative measure of aortic valve structural abnormality in epidemiology and for examination of interventions. In vivo studies Development of an animal model of aortic stenosis with vitamin D2 (Chapter 3) The aim of the study was to develop an appropriate animal model for AS. The study used vitamin D2 alone at 25,000IU/4 days weekly (vit-D2) for 8 weeks to induce AS in rabbits. Results showed that: 1) rabbits in the vit-D2 group had significantly increased in transvalvular velocity and pressure gradients compared to rabbits in the control group (normal chow + drinking water); this was consistent for aortic valve ultrasonic backscatter scores; 2) aortic valve immunohistochemistry/histology showed marked calcification, neutral lipids, macrophage, and leukocyte infiltrations for rabbits in the vit- D2 group (ie consistent with histology of human AS); 3) significant elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in the vit-D2 group occurred compared to controls over the 8 weeks treatment period; the change in ADMA concentrations correlated significantly with the change in transvalvular pressure gradients for rabbits in the vit-D2 group; 4) rabbits in the vit-D2 group had significantly impaired endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation, and this effect was completely abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME); 5) the addition of 0.5% cholesterol-supplemented diet to the vitamin D2 regimen did not accentuate the development of AS. Thus, treatment with vitamin D2 at 25,000IU/4 days weekly for 8 weeks significantly induced AS with similar aortic valve pathology to that of human AS; therefore, the model is suitable for use in examining potential therapeutic interventions in AS. Effects of ramipril on development of AS in rabbits (Chapter 4) Using this animal model, this study aimed to examine the effects of the angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) ramipril on development of AS. Rabbits (n=28) treated for 8 weeks were divided into 2 groups: (a) vitamin D2 alone (n=10) (normal chow + 25,000IU vitamin D2 in drinking water); (b) vitamin D2/Ramipril (n=12) (normal chow+25,000IU vitamin D2/Ramipril (0.5mg/kg) in drinking water). Six further rabbits constituted a normal reference group (no treatment was given). The results for comparisons between vitamin D2/ramipril vs vitamin D2 alone were as follows: 1) ramipril-treated rabbits had significantly less severe hemodynamic obstructions (p&lt;0.05, for both) as assessed by transvalvular velocity, and aortic valve area; with borderline reduction in aortic valve backscatter (p=0.08); 2) ramipril significantly reduced plasma ADMA concentrations; 3) there was improvement in acetylcholine-induced aortic relaxation (p=0.056), with significant improvement in sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation (p&lt;0.05); 4) there was a strong inverse correlation between acetylcholineinduced aortic relaxation and aortic valve backscatter score (0&lt;0.001), thus providing further evidence of the potential role of nitric oxide in retarding the development of AS in this model. These data provide a strong rationale for the inception of a randomized trial of ACE inhibition as a strategy for limitation of AS progression in humans. Human studies Aortic stenosis is associated with elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations in humans (Chapter 5). Given the findings that aortic stenosis induced by vitamin D2 in rabbits also caused elevation of plasma ADMA concentrations, a physiological inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, a mediator and marker of endothelial dysfunction and an indicator of incremental cardiovascular risk. The study sought to determine whether plasma ADMA concentrations are elevated independently of pre-existing coronary risk factors in subjects with at least moderate aortic stenosis (n=42) compared to age-matched patients with normal aortic valves (n=42): as determined both by visual assessment and with aortic valve backscatter scores &lt; 16dB. Results for this study were as follows: 1) plasma ADMA concentrations were not statistically different between the AS and non-AS group (median 0.59 vs 0.54 &#181;mol/L, p=0.13, Mann-Whitney test) on univariate analysis; 2) backward stepwise multiple linear regression showed the presence of AS was a significant predictor of elevated ADMA concentrations (p=0.04, 95% CI =0.001, 0.072). 3) in addition, elevated plasma ADMA concentrations were also associated with history of atrial fibrillation (p=0.009, 95% CI=0.015, 0.100), and negatively associated with creatinine clearance (p=0.01, 95% CI=-0.002, 0.000), and the use of statin therapy (p=0.01, 95% CI=-0.081, -0.011). Therefore, in conclusion, this study found that AS is independently associated with elevation of ADMA concentrations, beyond that implied by &#8220;conventional&#8221; risk factors for endothelial dysfunction. The clinical status of AS as an incremental marker of cardiovascular risk may reflect ADMA-mediated endothelial dysfunction. Assessment of factors associated with ASc in a random ageing population study (Chapter 6). There have been few clinical studies of factors associated with ASc. Previous population studies have established that ASc is an independent correlate of incremental risk of coronary events. Having established that patients with AS have increased plasma ADMA concentrations (Chapter 5), it was now aimed to determine whether subjects with increased aortic valve backscatter scores (ASc) also have other markers of endothelial dysfunction/NO effects, independent of preexisting coronary risk factors. The study was designed to identify such anomalies, if they existed, on an incremental basis to other putative correlates of ASc, including coronary risk factors, renal dysfunction and vitamin D levels. Random selected subjects (n=253) aged between 51 to 77 years were evaluated. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography examination; aortic valve ultrasonic backscatter score (AVBS), was used to quantitate echogenicity of the aortic valve. Conventional coronary risk factors were identified on history. Integrity of NO generation/response was assessed via (i) plasma ADMA concentrations; (ii) inhibition of platelet aggregation by the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP); (iii) aortic augmentation index (AIx), a measure of arterial stiffness/wave reflection. All putative correlations with AVBS were examined by univariate and stepwise multiple linear regression analyses. On the basis of echocardiographic appearances, ASc was present in 63 subjects (25.4%); mean AVBS scores was 14.9&#177;4.6dB (SD) vs 11.2&#177;3.9dB (SD) in the presence vs absence of ASc (p&lt;0.001). Univariate analyses revealed that platelet responsiveness to NO was inversely correlated with AVBS (&#946;=-0.16, p=0.02); but [ADMA] and AIx were not. On multiple linear regression, significant correlates of increased AVBS were: (i) advanced age (&#946;=0.21, p=0.003), (ii) low body mass index (&#946;=-0.23, p=0.001); and (iii) impaired platelet responsiveness to NO (&#946;=-0.16, p=0.02). In Chapter 7, the implications of the overall findings in this thesis are discussed in relation to future perspective.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aortic valve stenosis; endothelial function; nitric oxide; echocardiography</field><field name="subject">Aortic valve Abnormalities.

However, their national cinemas reveal that they have much in common. A significant number of recent films from both nations bear the mark of a similar obsessional quest for national identity that is linked to the exploration of a troubled colonial past. This shared preoccupation constitutes the starting point for this thesis, which compares the representation of colonial history in the cinema of France and Australia since 1970. It is of course evident that the two nations have had widely differing experiences of colonisation. Modern France is among the ranks of the major empire builders, and Australia is the product of one of Great Britain's most successful colonies. If neither nation can forget its colonial past, it is also for different reasons: France is the principal destination of migrants from her former colonies, and Australia faces landrights claims from her indigenous populations. If these differences provide the distinct social, political and geographical contexts of French and Australian cinema, they do not, however, impinge upon the stylistic and ideological analysis of their colonial thematics. For the purposes of this thesis, three fundamental criteria determine the inclusion of a film in the corpus: it must have an historical colonial setting; its narrative must focus principally on aspects of the colonisation process; and its director must be a descendant of the former colonisers. Around a dozen films released since 1970 in each country have been identified as matching these criteria and, for the purposes of the thesis, have been called postcolonial films. The content and structures of the films dictate the analytical approach and theories are drawn upon as tools when needed. These theories are widely varied across the disciplines and the theorists include Pierre Sorlin, Edward Sa&#239;d and Albert Memmi. The approach to representing colonial issues varies widely, with the majority of the films in the corpus neither appearing to confront openly nor to support the ideology of colonialism. Two exceptions are Coup de torchon (Tavernier, France, 1981) and The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (Schepisi, Australia, 1978). More typical of the ambivalent treatment of colonialism are the popularly attended films such as Indochine (Wargnier, France, 1991) and Picnic at Hanging Rock (Weir, Australia, 1975). In the first chapter an analysis of the relationship of the films to documented history demonstrates that French films are frequently set during the period between 1910 and 1950, and Australian films during the last half of the nineteenth century. The following chapter examines the relationship of the colonisers to their colonised lands and asks if the exceptional attention paid in all the films to the colonial geography has the effect of assimilating an alien landscape into the Western settlers&#8217; culture and mythology. The following two chapters address the core element of colonial life - in Franz Fanon's terms - its division into two worlds. The first of these chapters examines the interaction between the coloniser and the colonised through individual relationships between the two, and addresses the problem that all of these relationships end in permanent separation. The following chapter explores the interaction between coloniser and colonised as social groups that are divided by notions of race and discusses the general epistemological problem of the representation of the Other. The fifth chapter analyses the symbolic mechanisms being used to structure the films and manipulate the unconscious effect on the viewer. For example, there are a number of films with journeys of some kind, orphan-like characters and characters with strong noble savage qualities. Finally, the sixth chapter compares two of the films to the books from which they are derived. The object of this double comparison is to isolate differences in the films which are better explained by changing colonial politics than by inherent differences between cinema and literature. In the conclusion, it is argued that there appear to be few sustained attempts at confronting and resolving the problematic aspects of colonialism&#8217;s legacy. This is especially evident from the predominance of fictitious stories over the depiction of actual documented events. This tendency in both the French and Australian cinemas to contain the representation of the colonial past within a fictional framework has the inevitable consequence of masking history and thus avoiding the necessity of dealing with it. A further notable tendency was the preference for selecting certain periods and avoiding others, hence stripping the colonial past of its most embarrassing aspects. For example, no film could be found which showed the initial phase of the establishment of a colony. Despite the rarity of films released in France and Australia that openly challenge colonialism as a whole, many signs are evident throughout these films that the practices and values defending or justifying colonisation are nevertheless being questioned.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">France; Australia; cinema; colonial past; Australian films; Australian cinema; French films; French cinema; landscape and cinema; indigenous Australians; French colonies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Landscape evolution of the Umbum Creek Catchment, Western Lake Eyre, Central Australia.</field><field name="creator">Waclawik, Victor G.</field><field name="description">Landscape evolution is important for mineral and petroleum exploration concepts, especially in dryland continental settings. This study seeks to understand the main issues and controls on landscape evolution that have produced the regolith and young sediments around the western side of Lake Eye, in the arid heart of Australia. Several methods were employed including satellite image analysis, geomorphometry, geological mapping, regolith mapping and surveying. Outcomes indicate that the underlying structural fabric of the basement has controlled the development of the surface morphology of the Umbum Creek Catchment. The arrangement of basement faults is reflected in the distribution of surface landforms and in the topography of the land surface. Significant deformation of the Etadunna and Eyre formations indicate tectonic activity occurred at the end of the Miocene and was probably related to movement in the Lake Eyre Fault Zone. Pleistocene faulting is expressed as minor blind faulting associated with pre - existing basement faults. These faults remain active and current seismic activity is driven by changes in hydrostatic pressure (hydroseismicity). The scale of Pleistocene faulting and modern seismic activity demonstrates that since the Pliocene tectonic activity has been subdued. Climate change caused landforms developed under wet conditions during the Palaeogene and Neogene to be preserved by the development of aridity in the Pleistocene. High erosion rates associated with tectonism and the onset of aridity in the Pleistocene led to topographic inversion of many features. Palaeo-Proterozoic inliers formed inselbergs, silcrete outcrops formed capstones, gypsum hardpans protected underlying sediment from erosion creating plateaux of gypsum patterned ground and palaeo-channels on the Neales Fan were eroded to make heavily armoured mounds and associated sand dunes and sand sheets. The dominant factor influencing the evolution of the landscape in the Umbum Creek Catchment was the deposition of sedimentary sulphides within the Bulldog Shale. The excess sulphur that this sediment supplied to the landscape over time created the necessary conditions for the formation of a range of landscape features that would not otherwise exist. Weathering, oxidation and leaching of the sedimentary sulphides led to the development of silcrete. Subsequent weathering and tectonic activity led to the breakdown of the silcrete and the distribution of silcrete pebbles widely across the landscape forming gibber plains. Sulphur from the Bulldog Shale continued to contribute to the landscape forming intra-formational gypsum and precipitating as gypsum hardpans. This study has implications for petroleum exploration in dryland continental settings as potential reservoirs may be affected by secondary diagenetic processes, such as the formation of gypsum or silcretes, that could act as baffles or result in reduced porosity within the reservoir. The broad-scale architecture of fluvial systems, like the Neales Fan, may not conform to traditional fan-shaped models being, instead, comprised of structurally rearranged channels. In terms of earthquake risk assessment, the identification of hydroseismicity active within the Lake Eye Basin allows for a new level of predictability of earthquake behaviour within Central Australia.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landforms Australia Eyre, Lake, Basin.</field><field name="subject">Geomorphology Australia Eyre, Lake, Basin.</field><field name="subject">Geology, Structural Australia Eyre, Lake, Basin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/42833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Australia between 1983 and 1996: implications for manufacturing and industry policy.</field><field name="creator">Cook, Ian Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to establish whether Australia&#8217;s manufacturing competitiveness improved during the Hawke-Keating period of government (1983-1996), based on its performance prior to 1983. To achieve this aim it was necessary to identify what are the key characteristics impacting on competitiveness, and indeed, how do these factors interact? Importantly, the review was conducted from a broad-based strategic management perspective and not from an econometric standpoint. As a means of determining the above a detailed examination of the development of competitiveness was undertaken. It was found there was no single determinant insofar as, competitiveness cannot be attributed to one specific aspect, but is in fact influenced by a number of factors acting simultaneously. This involved a review of the informed contributions reflecting the development of competitiveness. Findings suggested the roots of competitiveness could largely be traced back to the doctrine of comparative advantage. However, much of this thinking was inevitably surpassed, when the correlation between competitiveness and strategy was better understood. Thus, in terms of manufacturing, this demanded the analysis of factors which appeared to independently and jointly influence competitiveness. It also showed within the manufacturing sector there was an inextricable link between productivity, increased competitiveness and growth. The contribution to the assessment of competitiveness by Professor Michael Porter was also studied in detail. The application of his work was examined with a view to the appropriateness of using his Determinants of National Advantage model in an Australian manufacturing context. Notably, this model provided a process which consistently explained the unique differences between participants within industrial environments. It also facilitated the identification of specific reasons for failure within an industry, which if left unchecked impacted on a nation&#8217;s competitiveness. Relative to competitiveness and, to the significance of Porter&#8217;s theories, an amended version of the &#8216;Diamond Model&#8217; was considered more appropriate for this thesis. Historically, Australia&#8217;s manufacturing sector has been traditionally underpinned by tariff protection to sustain its existence. Political efforts to counter the impact of competition appeared to remain a central part of industry policy. For instance, politicians such as McEwen shaped Australia&#8217;s post-war interventionist role by the use of politically imaginative industry policies to help shelter manufacturing from the threat of growing international competition. In 1965, the manufacturing sector underwent its first major restructure, driven by the objective to make it less reliant on government subsidies and support. This was followed by similar reform initiatives such as the Jackson Report (1977) and Crawford Committee Report (1979). The Hawke-Keating Government came to office in 1983 amidst a shattered economy. Mid-way through its administration period, however, the Hawke-Keating Government had to contend with the internationalisation of world economies. This led to a deliberate change in industry policy, particularly at a microeconomic level to a free market persuasion. An accelerated tariff reduction program was also introduced. Whilst there was genuine support for the manufacturing sector to improve its competitiveness, many thought a more measured and strategic change was warranted. Research suggested Australian manufacturing was highly dependent on multinationals for technology and employment but by the same token, lacked specialization, and economies of scale and scope in terms of utilising its capabilities. Australia&#8217;s manufacturers similarly failed to capitalize on aspects of research and development and innovation, languishing in a climate devoid of competition. Moreover, the manufacturing sector was not considered a prime investment target for international finance. In order to test these assertions a number of key hypotheses were developed. Following analyses, with the exception of the impact of manufactured imports on the economy, it was determined that manufacturing had improved in each of the categories assessed. However, largely, the sector&#8217;s performance was well below that of its international counterparts. Overall, these results add to the body of knowledge of competition literature, and also contribute to a better understanding of the factors which influence growth, sustainability, and the competitiveness of Australia&#8217;s manufacturing in general.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">manufacturing industries Australia; competition Australia evaluation; Australia economic conditions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/44234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short-chain fatty acid modulation of apoptosis in gastric and colon cancer cells.</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Geoffrey Mark</field><field name="description">Introduction: Gastric and colon cancer are major causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Gastric cancer is often detected at an advanced stage and current chemotherapeutics are only modestly effective against this neoplasm. Novel chemotherapeutics, chemopreventive agents and treatment strategies are required to prevent and treat gastric cancer. The ideal method to eliminate cancer cells may be the induction of apoptosis, further preventing cell proliferation and tumour growth. Recently, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) butyrate and propionate have been investigated as potential chemotherapeutic agents, particularly in colon cancer. Butyrate is reported to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells and is demonstrated to modulate intracellular redox state by altering the levels of an antioxidant, glutathione (GSH). GSH availability is controlled by the oxidative pentose pathway (OPP). Very few studies have investigated the effects of butyrate on cell types other than colon cancer cells, and even less is known regarding the effects of propionate. This thesis investigated the potential for SCFAs to induce apoptosis in a gastric cancer cell line, Kato III, compared to the colon cancer cell line, Caco-2. Cell cycle regulation, OPP activity, GSH availability and glucose metabolism were also assessed. Methods: Initial studies developed a new technique to measure 1-13C-D-glucose metabolism. Following this, Kato III and Caco-2 colon carcinoma cells were treated with butyrate or propionate (1mM, 5mM or 10mM) or a 5mM combination of both SCFAs. The induction of apoptosis and cell cycle alterations by these SCFAs were assessed using flow cytometry. OPP activity and GSH availability were assessed in both cell lines using colorimetric techniques. Butyrate metabolism was assessed using 13C-butyrate. Results: Butyrate and propionate significantly induced apoptosis and G2-M arrest in Kato III and Caco-2 cells, although to a significantly greater extent in the latter cell line. Moreover, butyrate induced apoptosis to a significantly greater extent than propionate, in both cell lines. SCFA treatment led to the significant up-regulation of OPP activity in both cancer cell lines while GSH availability was significantly reduced. Glucose metabolism was initially increased by all SCFA treatments, however, 72hr butyrate treatment led to its reduction. Importantly, glucose metabolism was measured using a new technique developed within this thesis. The rate of butyrate metabolism was demonstrated to correlate with the sensitivity of each cell line to this SCFA. Conclusions: This thesis provides evidence that SCFAs, particularly butyrate, induce apoptosis in gastric and colon cancer cells in vitro. The response of cancer cells to SCFAs appears complex, and involves multiple distinct mechanisms and pathways, including p53, Fas, changes to intracellular redox state and glucose metabolism. The capability of butyrate to induce apoptosis also appears to be directly related to the rate of its metabolism. Butyrate has the potential to be utilised as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of gastric cancer and colon cancer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Stomach--Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy)--Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Fatty acids.</field><field name="subject">Butyric acid.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/44402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and interactions of the C-terminal domain of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2.</field><field name="creator">Kuang, Zhihe</field><field name="description">"October, 2006" Bibliography: leaves 216-238. 6, xi, 238 leaves : ill.

Good error correcting performance enables efficient and reliable communication. However, a LDPC code decoding algorithm needs to be executed efficiently to meet cost, time, power and bandwidth requirements of target applications. The constructed codes should also meet error rate performance requirements of those applications. Since their rediscovery, there has been much research work on LDPC code construction and implementation. LDPC codes can be designed over a wide space with parameters such as girth, rate and length. There is no unique method of constructing LDPC codes. Existing construction methods are limited in some way in producing good error correcting performing and easily implementable codes for a given rate and length. There is a need to develop methods of constructing codes over a wide range of rates and lengths with good performance and ease of hardware implementability. LDPC code hardware design and implementation depend on the structure of target LDPC code and is also as varied as LDPC matrix designs and constructions. There are several factors to be considered including decoding algorithm computations,processing nodes interconnection network, number of processing nodes, amount of memory, number of quantization bits and decoding delay. All of these issues can be handled in several different ways. This thesis is about construction of LDPC codes and their hardware implementation. LDPC code construction and implementation issues mentioned above are too many to be addressed in one thesis. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of LDPC code construction methods for some classes of structured LDPC codes and techniques for reducing decoding time. We introduce two main methods for constructing structured codes. In the first method, column-weight two LDPC codes are derived from distance graphs. A wide range of girths, rates and lengths are obtained compared to existing methods. The performance and implementation complexity of obtained codes depends on the structure of their corresponding distance graphs. In the second method, a search algorithm based on bit-filing and progressive-edge growth algorithms is introduced for constructing quasi-cyclic LDPC codes. The algorithm can be used to form a distance or Tanner graph of a code. This method could also obtain codes over a wide range of parameters. Cycles of length four are avoided by observing the row-column constraint. Row-column connections observing this condition are searched sequentially or randomly. Although the girth conditions are not sufficient beyond six, larger girths codes were easily obtained especially at low rates. The advantage of this algorithm compared to other methods is its flexibility. It could be used to construct codes for a given rate and length with girths of at least six for any sub-matrix configuration or rearrangement. The code size is also easily varied by increasing or decreasing sub-matrix size. Codes obtained using a sequential search criteria show poor performance at low girths (6 and 8) while random searches result in good performing codes. Quasi-cyclic codes could be implemented in a variety of decoder architectures. One of the many options is the choice of processing nodes interconnect. We show how quasi-cyclic codes processing could be scheduled through a multistage network. Although these net-works have more delay than other modes of communication, they offer more flexibility at a reasonable cost. Banyan and Benes networks are suggested as the most suitable networks. Decoding delay is also one of several issues considered in decoder design and implementation. In this thesis, we overlap check and variable node computations to reduce decoding time. Three techniques are discussed, two of which are introduced in this thesis. The techniques are code matrix permutation, matrix space restriction and sub-matrix row-column scheduling. Matrix permutation rearranges the parity-check matrix such that rows and columns that do not have connections in common are separated. This techniques can be applied to any matrix. Its effectiveness largely depends on the structure of the code. We show that its success also depends on the size of row and column weights. Matrix space restriction is another technique that can be applied to any code and has fixed reduction in time or amount of overlap. Its success depends on the amount of restriction and may be traded with performance loss. The third technique already suggested in literature relies on the internal cyclic structure of sub-matrices to achieve overlapping. The technique is limited to LDPC code matrices in which the number of sub-matrices is equal to row and column weights. We show that it can be applied to other codes with a lager number of sub-matrices than code weights. However, in this case maximum overlap is not guaranteed. We calculate the lower bound on the amount of overlapping. Overlapping could be applied to any sub-matrix configuration of quasi-cyclic codes by arbitrarily choosing the starting rows for processing. Overlapping decoding time depends on inter-iteration waiting times. We show that there are upper bounds on waiting times which depend on the code weights. Waiting times could be further reduced by restricting shifts in identity sub-matrices or using smaller sub-matrices. This overlapping technique can reduce the decoding time by up to 50% compared to conventional message and computation scheduling. Techniques of matrix permutation and space restriction results in decoder architectures that are flexible in LDPC code design in terms of code weights and size. This is due to the fact that with these techniques, rows and columns are processed in sequential order to achieve overlapping. However, in the existing technique, all sub-matrices have to be processed in parallel to achieve overlapping. Parallel processing of all code sub-matrices requires the architecture to have the number of processing units at least equal to the number sub-matrices. Processing units and memory space should therefore be distributed among the sub-matrices according to the sub-matrices arrangement. This leads to high complexity or inflexibility in the decoder architecture. We propose a simple, programmable and high throughput decoder architecture based on matrix permutation and space restriction techniques.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LDPC codes; quasi-cyclic codes; girth; distance graphs; overlapping techniques; LDPC decoder</field><field name="subject">Error-correcting codes (Information theory) Coding theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/45525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The contribution of periodontal mechanoreceptors to physiological tremor in the human jaw.</field><field name="creator">Sowman, Paul Fredrick</field><field name="description">The human jaw, like all other articulated body parts, exhibits small oscillatory movements during isometric holding tasks. These movements, known as physiological tremor, arise as a consequence of the interaction of various factors. One of these factors is reflex feedback from peripheral receptors. In the human jaw, receptors that innervate the periodontium are able to transduce minute changes in force. This thesis examines the contribution of these periodontal mechanoreceptors (PMRs) to the genesis of physiological tremor of the human jaw. By using frequency domain analysis of time series recorded during isometric biting tasks, the character of physiological jaw tremor can be revealed. Physiological jaw tremor was observed in force recorded from between the teeth as well as from electromyograms recorded from the principal muscles of mastication. These recordings have shown us that jaw physiological tremor consists of a frequency invariant component between 6 and 10Hz. This frequency remains unaltered under various load conditions where the mechanical resonance of the jaw would be expected to vary greatly (Chapter 2). Such findings indicate a &#8216;neurogenic&#8217; origin for this tremor. A possible candidate for this neurogenic component of physiological tremor in the jaw is the reflex feedback arising from the PMRs. Using local anaesthetisation, it has been shown in this thesis, that by blocking outflow from the PMRs, the amplitude of neurogenic physiological jaw tremor can be reduced dramatically. This procedure caused a dramatic reduction in not only the mechanical recordings of tremor but also in the coupling between masseteric muscles bilaterally (Chapter 3) and between single motor units recorded from within a homonymous muscle (Chapter 4). The obvious mechanism by which periodontal mechanoreceptor anaesthetisation could reduce the amplitude of physiological tremor in the jaw would be by reducing the amplitude of the oscillatory input to the motoneurones driving the tremor. This interpretation remains controversial however as physiological tremor in the jaw can be observed at force levels above which the PMRs are supposedly saturated in their response. In light of this knowledge, the saturating characteristics of these receptors in terms of reflex output were examined. To do this, a novel stimulation paradigm was devised whereby the incisal teeth were mechanically stimulated with identical stimulus waveforms superimposed upon increasing tooth preloads. This necessitated the use of a frequency response method to quantify the reflexes. An optimal frequency for stimulation was identified and used to confirm that the hyperbolic saturating response of PMRs observed previously, translated to a similar phenomenon in masticatory reflexes (Chapter 5). These data reinforced the idea that physiological tremor in the jaw was not just a consequence of rhythmic reflex input from PMRs, as the dynamic reflex response uncoupled from the input as the receptor-mediated reflex response saturated. An alternative hypothesis was then developed that suggested the effect of PMR suppression in physiological tremor was via tonic rather than rhythmic effects on the masseteric motoneurone pool. By utilising a novel contraction strategy to manipulate the mean firing rate of the motor neuron pool at a given level of force production, data contained in Chapter 6 shows that population motor unit firing statistics influence the expression of physiological tremor, and such manipulations mimic, to an extent, the changes in firing statistics and tremor amplitude seen during anaesthetisation of the PMRs. This thesis therefore posits a mechanism whereby periodontal input influences the firing rate of motoneurones in such a way as to promote tremulous activity (Chapter 5). However, as this proposed mechanism did not explain the full extent of tremor suppression seen during PMR anaesthetisation it can therefore only be considered a contributing factor in a multifactor process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human; jaw; masseter; tremor; mastication; coherence analysis; EMG; single motor units; mandible; periodontal mechanoreceptors; teeth; periodontium; periodontal ligament</field><field name="subject">Jaws Muscles.

As such, the scope of an investigation should be dependent on the conditions at the site and the importance of the structure. However, it is common for the expense dedicated to the site investigation to be a fraction of the total cost of the project, and is typically determined by budget and time constraints, and the experience and judgement of the geotechnical engineer. However, additional site investigation expenditure or sampling is expected to reduce the financial risk of the design by reducing the uncertainties in the geotechnical system and protecting against possible foundation failures. This research has quantified the relative benefits of undertaking site investigations of increased and differing scope. This has been achieved by simulating the design process to yield a foundation design based on the results of a site investigation. Such a design has been compared to an optimal design that utilises the complete knowledge of the soil, which has only been possible due to the use of simulated soils. Comparisons between these two design types indicate the performance of the site investigation to accurately or adequately characterise the site conditions. Furthermore, the design based on the results of the site investigation have been analysed using the complete knowledge of the soil. This yields a probability of failure and, therefore, has been included in a risk analysis where the costs associated with the site investigation have been measured against the financial risk of the design. As such, potential savings in financial risk for increased site investigation expenditure have been subsequently identified. A Monte Carlo analysis has been used in this research to incorporate the uncertainties in the foundation design process. Uncertainties have been included due to soil variability; sampling errors; measurement and transformation model errors; and errors related to the use of a simplified foundation response prediction method. The Monte Carlo analysis has also provided the means to obtain results in a probabilistic framework to enable reliability and risk analyses. Computer code has been specifically developed with an aim to: generate a simulated soil that conforms to the variability of soil properties; simulate a site investigation to estimate data for a foundation design; simulate the design of a foundation and conduct a reliability and risk analysis of such a design. Results indicate that there are significant benefits to be derived from increasing the scope of a site investigation in terms of the risk and reliability of the foundation design. However, it also appears that an optimal site investigation scope or expenditure exists where additional expenditure leads to a design with a higher financial risk due to the increased cost of the site investigation. The expected savings in terms of financial risk are significant when compared to the increased investigation cost. These results will assist geotechnical engineers in planning a site investigation in a more rational manner with knowledge of the associated risks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">earth sciences; geology; geoscience, civil engineers</field><field name="subject">Engineering geology Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Soil dynamics Testing.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A hermeneutic phenomenological inquiry into the lived experience of Muslim patients in Australian hospitals.</field><field name="creator">Mohammadi, Nooredin</field><field name="description">In the past few years, many people with an Islamic background have settled in Australia. Within the health care context, this means that health care providers must modify the care provided to ensure it meets the needs of this culturally diverse population. Little nursing research has focused on understanding the perceptions and experiences of Muslim people within health care systems, particularly in Australia. This study provided an opportunity to explore, and document the experience of the hospitalisation for Islamic people and thereby advance the available information upon which important nursing care decisions that relate to this group can be more informatively made. This study aims to explore and interpret the lived experience of thirteen Muslim patients who had been hospitalised in an Australian hospital. The hermeneutic phenomenology of Heidegger (1967/1996), the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer (1989), and the ideas of van Manen (1990/1996) underpin this study. The meaning and understanding of the everyday experience of Muslim patient in a non-Islamic hospital is achieved through interpretation of the participants&#8217; stories. Data were generated using unstructured audio-taped interviews from participants. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed, then interpreted using phenomenological methods. The two themes to emerge from the participants&#8217; experiences are: Being-thrown-into-an-un-everyday-world and living-Islam-in-the-un-everyday-world. The theme of Being-thrown-into-an-un-everyday-world arose from the sub-themes of the awareness of self and Being an outsider. The theme living-Islam-in-the-un-everyday-world was drawn from the three sub-themes of Being the same and different, hindrances to being Muslim, and adapting-to-the-un-everyday-world. The findings of this study provide an insight into the experience of Muslims being cared for in Australian hospitals. It is hoped that this interpretation will make a significant contribution to the care of Muslim patients by having health professionals consider how this group could be cared for in a culturally sensitive manner. It is not intended as a prescription for care but draws the reader to reflect on aspects of the Muslim faith and how this may impact on individuals experience when in hospital. The scope of this study and the dearth of available research in this area conclude that much more research needs to be undertaken.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">muslim; phenomenology; multiculturalism; hospitalisation - lived experiences</field><field name="subject">Muslims--Australia--Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Hospital care--Australia--Case studies.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and metamorphism of the Pewsey Vale area North - East of Williamstown, S.A.</field><field name="creator">Offler, Robin</field><field name="description">The structure and petrology of Upper Precambrian and Cambrian rocks have been studied in detail, in an area 38 miles north - east of Adelaide, South Australia. The rocks occur within a broad zone of high grade metamorphism on the eastern side of the Mt. Lofty Ranges. The Upper Precambrian succession consists predominantly of pelitic and semi - pelitic schists, quartzites, calc - silicate rocks and calc - schists, and the Cambrian sequence of quartzo - feldspathic schists, migmatites, granite gneiss, calc - silicate rocks and minor pelitic schists and quartzites. The rocks have reached the sillimanite grade of metamorphism and the metamorphism is of the low pressure - intermediate type. Dolerites, pegmatites, minor granodiorites and granites intrude the meta - sediments. Mineralogical and structural relationships of the granite gneiss, indicate that it has been formed by recrystalliaation of the quartzo - feldspathic schists. Small scale metamorphic differentiation, appears to have accompanied the recrystallization. The migmatites are believed to have been formed by metamorphic differentiation rather than by anatexis. Three phases of deformation are recognised in the Upper Precambrian rocks and two in the Cambrian. The second deformation recorded in the Upper Precambrian rocks does not appear in the Cambrian rocks. Each deformation has been accompanied by the formation of foliation. In the Proterozoic rocks deformed by the second and third phases of folding, the foliation is a crenulation cleavage. The deformations in both the Upper Proterozoic and Cambrian sequences are considered to be related. Petrofabric studies of quartz, scapolite and biotite are related to the respective macroscopic structures. An analysis of the chronology of crystallisation and deformation of these rocks indicates that crystallisation continued during and after each phase of deformation. Faulting commenced either prior to or during meta - morphism. Intense metasomatic activity followed a later phase of faulting resulting in the widespread development of albitites and in some cases talc ore bodies. The albitites formed in the fault zone were subsequently brecciated by further movement and later healed by the introduction of more metasoinatic fluid.</field><field name="date">1966</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology, rocks, petrology, paleontology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural and metamorphic relations between low, medium and high grade rocks, Mt. Franks - Mundi Mundi area, Broken Hill, N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Glen, Richard Arthur</field><field name="description">Investigations in the northwestern part of the Willyama Complex centred on the Mt Franks - Mundi Mundi area have established a 4 km thick stratigraphic section of conformable metasediments containing thin horizons of basic volcanics in the lower two - thirds of the sequence. Establishment of this sequence was only possible once it was shown that the dominant lithological layering in metasediments is bedding, and that there has been no mesoscopic transposition during deformation. The metasediments represent a sequence of clay sands deposited in a distal shelf-slope or basin type of environment. A sequence of deformational and metamorphic events established in these rocks is regarded as an expression of the Middle Proterozoic Olarian Orogeny ( c.1695 - 1520 Ma. ) and except for some reactivation of shear zones, predate deposition and deformation of the unconformably overlying Adelaidean sediments. The important D&#8321; deformation is a complex, progressive event with pre-S&#8321; static mineral growth (biotite, andalusite, sillimanite, white mica) and early minor micro-folding recognized before syn-S&#8321; growth and F&#8321; folding. An even earlier period of pre-S&#8321; fabric formation mainly defined by white mica, biotite and ilmenite, is not related to any visible folding and may either represent an earlier discrete event or an early phase of the D&#8321; event, However, as now defined, minerals outlining this pre-S&#8321; fabric are related to the D&#8321; event. The low, medium and high grade metamorphic zones defined in the field by biotite, andalusite and sillimanite respectively are pre-S&#8321; in age and predate F&#8321; folding. The intensity of metamorphism increases with depth so that there is a broad depth control on metamorphism. Relations at the andalusite/sillimanite isograd conform to a Carmichael (1969) type model and reactions took place via an intermediate sericite phase. The main effect of F&#8321; folding is the formation of the variably plunging variably oriented Kantappa - Lakes Nob Syncline of regional extent. Only the western limb of this fold is now visible over much of its length. This fold deforms existing metamorphic zones and thus controls the relationship of low, medium and high grade rocks in this part of the Willyama Complex. The orientation of this syncline changes from vertical in the low grade rock to inclined at depth. The western limb becomes overturned at depth so that subsequent folds are downward facing. There is also a change in fold tightness with depth - from open-tight in the low grades to tight-isoclinal in the high grades, and this is accompanied by a change in S&#8320;/S&#8321;  relations (from core to limb area) from non parallel to parallel. These changes are coupled with a rotation of extension direction (mass transfer direction) from subvertical to inclined and may be explained by original formation and subsequent modification of upright F&#8321; folds. Later modifications are recorded by open folding and overturning of S&#8321; - this is ascribed to a final phase of the D&#8321; event. Mineral growth in D&#8321; time resulted in the formation of S&#8321; varying in grade from muscovite + quartz to sillimanite. S&#8321; varies from homogeneous to layered, and in the latter case, consists of M + QM layers,the spacing of which is controlled by F&#8321; microfolding. S&#8321; formation involved rotation, mass transfer, and volume decrease in M layers and (re) crystallisation. The D&#8322; event in this area was of only minor significance. The D&#8323;  event developed in response to NW-SE shortening and resulted in the formation of variably plunging, vertical northeast trending folds. Where SW plunging, these folds lie subparallel to L&#8321;. The nature of the D&#8323;  event is controlled to a large extent by S&#8320; / S&#8321; relations and folding of S&#8321; across unfolded S&#8320; occurs where S&#8320; lies parallel to the XY plane of the D&#8323;  event. S&#8323;  formed as a muscovite + quartz schistosity by rotation, re crystallisation, mass transferand mimetic growth. During the final stages of the D&#8323;  event, north-east trending retrograde schist zones were formed. These were later reactivated during the folding of the Adelaidean. The final phase of the Olarian Orogeny consists of minor D&#8324; folding and crenulation.</field><field name="date">1978</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology, rocks, metamorphic rocks</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A multidisciplinary approach to complex systems design.</field><field name="creator">Ryan, Alex J.</field><field name="description">The design and management of organised systems, comprised of dynamic interdependent collectives of autonomous agents, is the kind of problem that the discipline of complex systems is intended to address. Nevertheless, conventional model-based applications of complex systems may be of limited utility when the problem is also data-poor and soft. In this case, a quantitative model may be at best meaning-less; at worst harmful. Systems approaches, such as soft systems methodologies, have been developed that provide some guidance in this domain. However, these alternatives do not utilise the exact techniques of complex systems, preferring to abandon mathematical representations altogether. It is the aim of this thesis to advance a &#8220;conceptual analysis" approach to complex systems design that exploits deep insights from the mathematics of complex systems, without building explicit models of the underlying system. It is argued that this approach can extend the domain of applicability of the discipline of complex systems into situations where quantitative data is unavailable, and human and social factors are significant. Conceptual analysis of complex systems is inherently multidisciplinary, because it is broader than the foundations of any single conventional discipline. This is reflected in the structure of this thesis, which spans the philosophy, theory and application of complex systems. Part I on systems philosophy develops an understanding of representation, which sheds light on the utility and limitations of models. The history of the systems movement is then surveyed, systemism is distinguished from both individualism and holism, and `system' is defined. Complex systems is contrasted with both early systems theory and contemporary systems approaches. Part II on complex systems theory firstly relates the major theoretical concepts within a rigourous information theoretical framework. They include complexity, edge of chaos, self-organisation, emergence, adaptation, evolution and self refer- entiality. The central systems concept - emergence - is then examined in depth beyond its information theoretic interpretation, leading to a concise definition of emergent properties and emergence. A new framework for understanding emergence in terms of scope, resolution and state yields substantial novel insights. It is shown that emergence is coupled to scope, in contrast to the conventional explanation that relates levels of description. Part III applies the preceding philosophical and theoretical framework to real-world problems in the defence and security arena. In the first example, the theory of multi-scale complexity reveals structural impediments to success for conventional force structures in asymmetric warfare, such as Operation Iraqi Freedom. The second example analyses the capability development process, which is responsible for transforming the security needs of Government into equipment purchasing decisions. The analysis produces practical recommendations for improvements that address the underlying complexity of the problem. Reflections in the conclusion of this thesis focus on the interrelations between philosophy, theory and application. As the individual contributions of this thesis are woven into a single tapestry, they demonstrate the utility of a multidisciplinary approach to complex systems design.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mathematics; Mathematical models; Complexes (Mathematics)</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47784</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reframing the dynamics: a case study of the interaction between architectural computing and relationship-based procurement at the National Museum of Australia.</field><field name="creator">Swift, John Paul</field><field name="description">The National Museum of Australia (NMA) (1997- 2001) by architects Ashton Raggatt McDougall (ARM) in association with Robert Peck von Hartel Trethowan was commissioned by the Australian Commonwealth Government for the Centenary of Federation in 2001. It was conceived as a gift to the people of Australia and now stands on Acton Peninsula in Canberra, the nation's Capital. It is a visually complex manifestation of the design architects' (ARM) dialogue with the ambiguities of Australian history and national identity. The architectural realisation of these complexities was facilitated through advances in computer technologies and a complementary non-traditional procurement method, both at the leading edge of Australian architectural practice of the time. Completed three years earlier was probably the most debated work of architecture of the 1990s, the Guggenheim Museum (GMB) (1991-98) in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank O. Gehry and Associates (FOG&amp;A). This satellite museum of the Guggenheim Foundation of New York was heralded as the quintessential example of a kind of architecture only possible because of advances in computer technologies. Both visually complex museums were conceived as flagship projects and consequently share many political, functional, and cultural expectations. Both were procured outside the usual adversarial designer/builder paradigm of western architecture and featured the innovative use of three-dimensional (CAD) software for design, documentation and analysis. The NMA project used a government instigated procurement method which was embraced by a group of design and construction companies who formed a joint venture known as the Acton Peninsula Alliance. This non-traditional or relationship-based procurement method required ARM to reassess their approach to generate and disseminate design data and their traditional relationship with other design and construction professionals. As part of this process, ARM were required to devolve some of their design authority to a project delivery team via a Design Integrity Panel and an Independent Quality Panel; both innovations integral to the Acton Peninsula Alliance. The NMA project reframed many of the enduring professional relationships of Australian architecture and in so doing extended the skill set and expectations of the architects and others to include a more substantial engagement with 3D CAD and a procurement system which was less subject to many of the common impediments inherent in the more traditional processes. Through a series of interviews with the architects and other stakeholders, a qualitative methodology was used to investigate the NMA as a case study which uses the GMB as an internationally recognised comparison. This thesis examines how these two projects have been successfully completed within time and budgetary constraints in an environment where flagship projects have had a history of highly publicised difficulties. It reveals that the successful realisation of the NMA was due to the relationships built or reframed as a result of this cooperative approach in conjunction with high levels of engagement with computer technologies. This is in contrast to the seamless flow of data and high levels of prefabrication integral to the success of the GMB.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">architecture, public architecture, computer-aided design, construction industry, industrial procurement, National Museum of Australia</field><field name="subject">National Museum of Australia Planning.</field><field name="subject">Architecture Australia Designs and plans.</field><field name="subject">Computer-aided design Case studies.</field><field name="subject">Museums Australian Capital Territory Canberra Planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel multiparameter flow cytometry techniques for the detection of leukaemia associated phenotypes and minimal residual disease monitoring in acute myeloid leukaemia.</field><field name="creator">Al-Mawali, Adhra Hilal Nasser</field><field name="description">Despite high remission rate in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) after chemotherapy, relapse of the underlying disease remains a major challenge and one of the most frequent causes of treatment failure. In this study, the presence of leukaemiaassociated phenotypes (LAPs) was first studied retrospectively using our standard diagnostic protocol with 3-colour flow cytometry. LAPs were present in 54 (64%) of 84 AML patients analysed between 2002 to 2004. The presence of LAPs was correlated with failure to respond to induction chemotherapy (p &lt;0.05) in univariate analysis. Presence of LAPs was shown to be an independent predictor for failure to respond to induction chemotherapy with a relative risk ratio of 1.6 (p &lt; 0.05, 95% CI, 1.0-2.6) in multivariate analysis. Subsequently, in a prospective study, we used 5-colour multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) for detection of LAPs to determine if LAPs could be detected in a greater proportion of leukaemic patients and minimal residual disease (MRD) detection could therefore be applied in more patients. In 54 consecutive, newly diagnosed AML patients from 2005 to 2007, LAPs were identified in 51 (94%). Thus, MRD studies were potentially applicable to virtually all patients. The sensitivity and specificity of MFC technique was improved by analysing 10 normal and 5 regenerating bone marrows (BM) for the presence of these LAPs and by determining maximum log difference (LD). CD7, CD19, CD2, CD11b and CD56 were the most sensitive and reliable markers for MRD studies. LAPs were rarely detected in either normal or regenerating BMs. Through dilutional experiments from 50% LAPs to 0.001%, it was determined that 1 leukaemic in 104 and 105 normal cells could be detected using the improved techniques. Of the 54 patients, 31 received chemotherapy, with 27 achieving complete remission (CR). Two were LAP negative and thus 25 were evaluable for MRD post induction and 22-post consolidation chemotherapy. Detection of MRD &gt;0.15% was able to distinguish between two groups of patients according to relapse status. Although, the number of patients was small, detection of MRD post induction &gt; 0.15% was shown to be an independent predictor of adverse prognosis for both relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in a multivariate analysis [p = 0.037 and 0.026, 95% CI (1.1-20.5 and 1.2-22.2), hazard ratio 4.7 and 5.2 respectively]. Post consolidation, there was a trend for patients with higher MRD values to show shorter RFS (p = 0.06). MFC using 5-colour allows us to detect LAPs in virtually all AML patients and our preliminary results suggest the technique is a suitable approach for MRD analysis. However, 5-colour MFC is technically challenging, resource intensive, and may not be feasible in a routine diagnostic laboratory. This led us to assess whether we could identify other potential markers for LAPs. Interleukin-3 alpha receptor- chain IL-3_ (CD123) has been suggested to be a marker of leukaemic stem cells (LSC). These cells are thought to be responsible for initiating and maintaining leukaemic cell growth post chemotherapy and hence to give rise to relapse of the disease. Therefore, we analysed 34 AML patients for expression of CD123 in the blast population and defined a population containing leukaemic stem cells using the immunophenotypic markers CD123+/CD34+/CD38-. Thirty-two (94%) of AML patients expressed CD123. We then used a molecular marker to determine whether CD123 expression was confined to the LSC. Thirtynine patients were screened for the presence of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 - internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) as the most common molecular abnormality in AML patients. Of those, 12 (31%) were FLT3/ITD positive. In seven of them, CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ and CD34+/CD38-/CD123- populations were sorted to homogeneity by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (BD FACSAriaTM Cell Sorter) and tested for FLT3/ITD. In six of seven patients with FLT3/ITD positive AML, we could not detect the mutation in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123- fraction, but the mutation was detected in the CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ fraction in all seven patients. This novel finding demonstrates that, the oncogenic event occurs in CD123 positive cells, thus supporting the concept that CD123 is a marker of the LSC in CD123 positive AML. This observation suggests novel treatment approaches employing surface marker CD123-targeting antibodies may be of use in the treatment of AML. In conclusion, we demonstrate that using five-colour MFC improves LAP detection in AML and enables MRD studies using immunophenotyping to be applied to virtually all AML patients. Additionally, it increases the sensitivity of the technique for detecting LAP populations. Moreover, evaluation of MRD post induction chemotherapy is the most sensitive time point for detection of MRD, with MRD levels &gt;0.15% predicting relapse and worse prognosis. As an alternative to using individualised LAPs specific to each patient, CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ cells may in the future serve as a better marker for MRD studies. This marker identifies the putative LSC, which is responsible for regrowth of leukaemia and relapse of the disease. Thus, instead of looking at whole &#8220;blast&#8221; population which results in huge data analysis and interpretation for the different LAPs which may have different underlying biology, it may be more informative to look at the frequency of LSC after achieving CR using CD34+/CD38-/CD123+ as the single LAP for MRD studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">acute myeloid leukaemia; flow cytometry; immunophenotyping; minimal residual disease</field><field name="subject">Acute myeloid leukemia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional scale modelling of the lower River Murray wetlands: a model for the assessment of nutrient retention of floodplain wetlands pre- and post-management.</field><field name="creator">Bjornsson, Kjartan Tumi</field><field name="description">Most of the lower River Murray and its floodplain wetlands are impacted upon by degradation caused by river regulation. Increasingly the restoration of these ecosystems and the river water quality has become a high priority for federal and state governments and associated departments and agencies. Public concern is adding to the pressures on these departments and agencies to restore these ecosystems and to sustainably maintain the river water quality. The long term monitoring of floodplain wetlands has been limited, compounding the difficulties faced by managers and decision makers on assessing the potential outcome of restoration options. The role of this project in the broad scheme of restoration/rehabilitation is to contribute to the construction of a model capable of increasing managers and decision makers understanding, and build consensus of potential outcomes of management option. This model was to use available data. The developed model, based on WETMOD developed by Cetin (2001), simulates wetland internal nutrient processes, phytoplankton, zooplankton and macrophyte biomass as well as the interaction (nutrient and phytoplankton exchange) between wetlands and the river. The model further simulates the potential impact management options have on the wetlands, and their nutrient retention capacity, and therefore their impact on the river nutrient load. Due to the limitation of data, wetlands were considered in categories for which data was available. Of these two had sufficient data to develop, calibrate and validate the model. Management scenarios for these two wetlands were developed. These scenarios included, the impact of returning a degraded wetland in a turbid state to a rehabilitated clear state, and the impact the removal of nutrient from irrigation drainage inflows has on wetland nutrient retention, and consequent input to the river. Scenarios of the cumulative impact of the management of multiple wetlands were developed based on using these two wetlands, for which adequate data was available, as &#8220;exemplar&#8221; wetlands, i.e. data from these wetlands were substituted for other similar wetlands (those identified as belonging to the same category). The model scenarios of these multiple wetlands provide some insight into the potential response management may have on individual wetlands, the cumulative impact on river nutrient load and how wetland morphology may relate to management considerations. The model is restricted by data availability and consequently the outputs. Further, some limitations identified during the development of the model need to be addressed before it can be applied for management purposes. However, the model and methods provide a guide by which monitoring efforts can assist in developing future modelling assessments and gain a greater insight not only at the monitoring site but also on a landscape scale.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">River Murray; wetland modelling; wetland management; wetland nutrient retention</field><field name="subject">Wetlands South Australia Murray River Region (S.

There is international speculation that parasite transmission from farmed to wild fish leads to increased incidence of parasitism in wild fish. Conversely, transfer of parasites from wild fish to farmed fish can negatively impact upon the health of farmed fish. Baseline information on the parasite assemblage of wild S. lalandi in Australia will: 1) allow informed judgments to be made in order to responsibly monitor, and perhaps remedy, potentially negative impacts and; 2) enable identification of parasite species of potential harm to the Australian S. lalandi aquaculture industry. I collected wild Seriola spp. (Carangidae) throughout southern Australia and examined them for metazoan parasites. Fifty-six metazoan parasite species are identified, including one new species. A taxonomic listing is provided for the metazoan parasites found. Taxonomic descriptions are made for the blood fluke Paradeontacylix godfreyi n. sp. (Digenea: Sanguinicolidae) and a redescription is provided for the parasitic copepod Naricolax chrysophryenus (Cyclopoida: Bomolochidae). A qualitative risk assessment was devised for the metazoan parasite taxa identified for the sea-cage aquaculture of S. lalandi in South Australia. Risk was interpreted considering the likelihood and consequence of parasite establishment and proliferation. The monogeneans Benedenia seriolae and Zeuxapta seriolae were considered extremely likely to establish and proliferate. Benedenia seriolae also poses high potential negative consequences for cost-effective S. lalandi sea-cage farming. However, the absence of potential mitigation methods and parasite management for Paradeontacylix spp. (Digenea), Kudoa sp. and Unicapsula seriolae (Myxozoa) indicates that these species may also present high negative consequences for S. lalandi aquaculture in Australia. The nature of wild Seriola migrations is critical for an understanding of the potential impact of disease and parasite interactions between wild and farmed fish. A small-scale tagging programme of wild-caught S. lalandi and S. hippos in South Australia provided insight into the movements of these species. Recapture results indicate that large S. lalandi remain in, or return to, northern Spencer Gulf. S. lalandi also move past sea-cage farms in Fitzgerald Bay, northern Spencer Gulf, which is an important consideration in view of potential expansion of the S. lalandi sea-cage industry in Spencer Gulf. There is surprisingly little experimental assessment on parasite transmission from farmed fish to wild fish. Studies assessing parasite interactions between wild and cultured fish employ models to quantify parasite population levels of cultured, wild and escaped fish, while others carry out comparative surveys of parasite prevalence and intensity over time, in areas close to and distant from farming activity. I provide preliminary data on ectoparasite prevalence and intensity on wild S. lalandi in areas close to, distant from and where there is no sea-cage farming in southern Australia. I review methods employed in the northern hemisphere to assess sea-louse transfer between wild and farmed salmon and propose methods for assessing monogenean parasite transmission from farmed to wild S. lalandi in Australia. In summary, this thesis provides insight into the potential for parasite interactions between wild and farmed S. lalandi. I document the parasite assemblage of wild and farmed S. lalandi and wild S. hippos and provide baseline data on &#8216;natural&#8217; parasite prevalence and intensity. I provide a taxonomic description of a new species of blood fluke. I indicate the likelihood of parasite transfer from wild fish to farmed S. lalandi, and identify parasite taxa with potentially negative consequences for sea-cage aquaculture. I provide the first firm data that wild S. lalandi move past one area where kingfish are farmed in sea-cages in South Australia. Finally, I propose procedures to better understand the potential for monogenean parasite transmission from farmed S. lalandi to wild fish. This thesis reports new information that is important when considering and managing expansion of the S. lalandi sea-cage aquaculture industry throughout Australia. It also provides baseline data on natural parasite levels to enable ongoing monitoring of the potential impacts of the industry on wild fish populations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parasites; aquaculture; taxonomy; risk assessment; Seriola; aquatic animal health</field><field name="subject">Yellowtail Parasites South Australia.

This phenomenon has been considered as an important limitation to physical performance with a prevalence of ~50 % in trained male athletes, but described in both sexes, across the range of both age and physical fitness in more recent literature. Previously this phenomenon has been described as a decrement in both arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO&#8322;) and oxy-haemoglobin saturation (SaO&#8322;or SpO&#8322;) with, particularly important for PaO&#8322;, a lack of or inappropriate correction made for the change in body temperature during intense exercise. The initial study of this thesis determined the thermal response within the body at physiologically relevant sites measured simultaneously during an incremental exercise test. The results demonstrated the inadequacy of rectal temperature as an indicator of the acute temperature changes occurring during an incremental exercise test due to its slow response rate and relative thermal inertia. Radial arterial blood and oesophageal temperatures were shown to behave almost identically during the exercise test, albeit with an offset of approximately 1.3&#186;C, and were considered much more appropriate and relevant indicators of thermal changes during exercise. As an extension of the initial work active muscle temperature (vastus lateralis) was measured during the exercise test, demonstrating a significantly lower resting temperature than the oft-reported &#8220;core&#8221; temperatures (rectal and oesophageal) as well as a significantly greater increase in temperature in comparison to all other measurement sites. Overall, the results of this first study indicated that the physiologically relevant temperatures measured at the oesophageal and muscle sites differed markedly to the outdated rectal temperature measurement site and should be used as measures of thermal response when evaluating oxygen loading (oesophageal) or unloading (active muscle). Utilising the definition of EIH as a decrease in PaO&#8322; of &#8805; 10 mmHg, the effect of temperature correcting PaO&#8322; was evaluated in the second study. Arterial blood gases measured simultaneously to the temperature measurements during the incremental exercise test were adjusted for the temperature changes at each site (every 1&#186;C increase in temperature will increase a PaO&#8322; value by ~5 mmHg). Whilst uncorrected PaO&#8322; values indicated an almost 100% prevalence of EIH in this group, oesophageal temperature corrected PaO&#8322; values decreased this prevalence to ~50% while muscle temperature corrections resolved all cases of EIH and demonstrated an HYPEROXAEMIA (i.e. the reverse of the well-established phenomenon) in the majority of subjects. Further investigation of arterial oxygen content during the exercise test indicates that there is no disruption in the delivery of oxygen to the active muscles and therefore any performance decrement should be attributed to another mechanism. Whilst the phenomenon of EIH is determined by the definition applied and the use of temperature corrections in the case of PaO&#8322;, its reproducibility in a test-retest situation had not previously been determined. Utilising a subset of previously tested subjects, the reproducibility of both temperature and PaO&#8322; were determined with results indicating that the blood gas response was highly reproducible, especially the minimum PaO&#8322; value noted during each exercise test. However, comparing a more statistically relevant definition of a change in PaO&#8322; of &#177; 2 standard deviations from the mean resting PaO&#8322; to the previous delimiter of 10 mmHg indicated a lesser reproducibility of the prevalence of EIH. In summary, this thesis exposes the inadequacies of previous research into EIH with regard to the expected reproducibility of the phenomenon and the need to correctly adjust PaO&#8322; values for exercise-induce hyperthermia as well as demonstrating the difference in thermal responses to acute exercise in physiologically significant areas of the body. Furthermore, previously described correlations between the change in PaO&#8322; and VO&#8322; max were not evident in the subjects tested within this thesis, nor was there any indication of a diffusion limitation based on reduced pulmonary capillary transit time (by association with VO&#8322; max) or pulmonary oedema (rebuked by a rapid return of PaO&#8322; to above resting levels following exercise cessation).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">exercise-induced hypoxemia; temperature correction; reproducibility; oxygen content</field><field name="subject">Exercise -- Physiological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Anoxemia -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Temperature -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Body temperature -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Body temperature -- Regulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Building the evidence base for disinvestment from ineffective health care practices: a case study in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome.</field><field name="creator">Elshaug, Adam Grant</field><field name="description">In the early 1990s claims were made that in all areas of health care, &#8220;30-40% of patients do not receive treatments of proven effectiveness&#8221;, and, &#8220;20-25% of patients have treatments that are unnecessary or potentially harmful&#8221;. Many such practices were diffused prior to the acceptance of modern evidence-based standards of clinical- and cost-effectiveness. I define disinvestment in the context of health care as the processes of withdrawing (partially or completely) resources from any existing health care practices, procedures, technologies or pharmaceuticals that are deemed to deliver little or no health gain relative to their cost, and thus are not efficient health resource allocations. Arguably disinvestment has been central to Evidence-Based Medicine(EBM) for well over a decade yet despite general advances in EBM, this topic remains relatively unexplored. This thesis examines the ongoing challenges that exist within the Australian context relating to effective disinvestment. Upper airway surgical procedures for the treatment of adult Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSA) are used as a case study to contextualise these challenges. This thesis has six sections: 1. A review of the literature outlines developments in EBM broadly and provides a detailed background to OSA, including the numerous treatment options for the condition. This review examines evidence that highlights the importance of &#8216;highly effective treatment&#8217; over &#8216;subtherapeutic treatment&#8217; as a necessity to confer improved health outcomes in OSA. It is argued that claims of surgical success inherent in most published results of surgery effectiveness fail to assimilate contemporary evidence for clinically significant indicators of success. 2. Section two comprises the first reported meta-analysis in this area. It presents the pooled success rates of surgery according to various definitions. Specifically, when the traditional &#8216;surgical&#8217; definition of success is applied the pooled success rate for Phase I (i.e. soft palate) surgical procedures is 55% (that is 45% fail). However, using a more stringent definition (endorsed by the peak international sleep medicine body), success is reduced to 13% (that is 87% fail). Similarly for Phase II (i.e. hard palate) procedures success rates decrease from 86% to 43% respectively when moving from a surgical to a medical definition of success. That various medical specialties differentially define treatment success, I argue, creates uncertainty for observers and non-clinical participants in this debate (eg policy stakeholders and patients). This represents a barrier to disinvestment decisions. 3. Results are presented from a clinical audit of surgical cases conducted as a component of this thesis. Both clinical effectiveness and procedural variability of surgery are reported. A unique methodology was utilised to capture data from multiple centres. It is the first time such a methodology has been reported to measure procedural variability alongside clinical effectiveness (inclusive of a comparative treatment arm). The observed cohort (n=94) received 41 varying combinations of surgery in an attempt to treat OSA. Results on effectiveness demonstrate an overall physiological success rate of 13% (according to the most stringent definition; phases I and II combined). This demonstration of procedural variability combined with limited effectiveness highlights clinical uncertainty in the application of surgical procedures. 4. Section four outlines how a qualitative phase of enquiry, directed at exploring the perspectives and experiences of surgery recipients, was approved by three independent research ethics review boards but was not supported by a small group of surgeons, resulting in the project being canceled. Potential consequences of this for impeding health services research (HSR) are discussed. 5. Two sets of results are reported from a qualitative phase of enquiry (semi-structured interviews) involving senior Australian health policy stakeholders. The first results are of policy stakeholders&#8217; perspectives on the surgical meta-analysis and clinical audit studies in 2 and 3 above. The second results are from an extended series of questions relating to challenges and direction for effecting disinvestment mechanisms in Australia. Stakeholder responses highlight that Australia currently has limited formal systems in place to support disinvestment. Themes include how defining and proving inferiority of health care practices is not only conceptually difficult but also is limited by data availability and interpretation. Also, as with any policy endeavour there is the ever-present need to balance multiple interests. Stakeholders pointed to a need, and a role, for health services and policy research to build methodological capacity and decision support tools to underpin disinvestment. 6. A final discussion piece is presented that builds on all previous sections and summarises the specific challenges that exist for disinvestment, including those methodological in nature. The thesis concludes with potential solutions to address these challenges within the Australian and international context. Systematic policy approaches to disinvestment represent one measure to further improve equity, efficiency, quality of care, as well as sustainability of resource allocation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">disinvestment; health policy; obstructive sleep apnoea, apnea; surgery; evidence based medicine; obsolescence; cost-effectiveness; health technology assessment</field><field name="subject">Evidence-based medicine</field><field name="subject">Sleep apnea syndromes Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal alterations of gene expression in rice.</field><field name="creator">Plett, Darren Craig</field><field name="description">Two problems hampering efforts to produce salt-tolerant plants through constitutive expression of transgenes include: 1. Spatial control. Particular cell-types must respond specifically to salt stress to minimise the amount of Na&#8314; delivered to the shoot; and, 2. Temporal control. Transgenes are typically expressed in plants at similar levels through time, irrespective of the stress encountered by the plant, which may exacerbate pleiotropic effects and means that, particularly in low-stress conditions, costly and/or detrimental metabolic processes may be active, thus reducing yield. To address these issues, Gateway&#174; destination vector constructs were developed combining the GAL4 UAS (upstream activating sequence) with the ethanol-inducible gene expression system to drive inducible cell-specific expression of Na&#8314; transporter transgenes (or to silence salt transporter transgenes inducibly and cell-specifically). Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines (Johnson et al., 2005: Plant J. 41, 779-789) that express GAL4 and GFP specifically in either the root epidermis or xylem parenchyma (and therefore &#8216;trap&#8217; cell-type specific enhancer elements) were transformed with this GAL4 UAS &#8211; ethanol switch construct, thereby allowing both spatial and temporal control of transgenes. In preliminary experiments, the expression system successfully limited the expression of RFP to specific cell-types after induction with ethanol. Other genes expressed using this system include PpENA1, a Na&#8314;-extruding ATPase from the moss, Physcomitrella patens, and AtHKT1;1, a Na &#8314; transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana. The two enhancer trap rice lines were also transformed with the GAL4 UAS driving stable expression of AtHKT1;1 and PpENA1 specifically in root epidermal or xylem parenchyma cells. Expression of AtHKT1;1 in root epidermal cells reduced Na&#8314; accumulation in the shoots, while expression in the root xylem parenchyma appeared to have little effect on shoot Na&#8314; accumulation. Using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) X-ray microanalysis, the outer cells of the roots of the line expressing AtHKT1;1 in the epidermal cells were found to accumulate higher levels of Na&#8314; than the parental enhancer trap line. Additionally, this line had decreased unidirectional &#178;&#178;Na&#8314; influx. Similar results were observed for plants expressing AtHKT1;1 driven by the CaMV 35S</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity; rice; gene expression; sodium; transport; GAL4; enhancer trap; ethanol switch; HKT1; ENA1; radioactive tracer; X-ray microanalysis</field><field name="subject">Rice</field><field name="subject">Rice Genetics</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Salt-tolerant crops</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the relation between fluid flow over bluff bodies and accompanying acoustic radiation.</field><field name="creator">Blazewicz, Antoni Michal</field><field name="description">The relationship between distinctive characteristic fluid-flow regimes and the sound radiation generated by them has been investigated, over a range of Reynolds numbers, for various single plates and two-plate arrays in nominally two-dimensional flows. In preliminary experiments, the characteristics of flow over single plates with rectangular cross-section and faired leading edges and over tandem arrays of an upstream plate with rectangular cross-section and faired leading edges and a downstream plate of rectangular cross-section were investigated, together with the sound radiation produced. However, the main investigation has been concentrated on single plates of rectangular cross-section with various chord-to-thickness ratios C and on arrays of two plates of rectangular cross-section in tandem having various chord-to-thickness ratios C&#8321; and C&#8322; and a range of gaps (with gap-to-thickness ratios G) between them. The range of Reynolds number based on plate thickness t and free-stream velocity U, Re[subscript]t = Ut/&#957; (where &#957; is the kinematic viscosity of fluid) covered in the measurements is 3.2 x 10[superscript]3 &#8804; Re[subscript]t 53 x 10[superscript]3. Spectra of velocity fluctuations in the flow and radiated sound have been measured and their characteristic frequencies related. An attempt has been made to measure force fluctuations on surfaces of the plates in order to relate them to flow characteristics and radiated sound power. Mean and fluctuating pressures associated with the force fluctuations on the plates have also been obtained. The lengths of separation bubbles on long rectangular plates have also been determined. In most cases, the measurements have been complemented by flow-visualisation in a water tunnel to provide additional detailed insight into the flow patterns. Three flow regimes have been identified for single plates of rectangular cross-section. In the first regime (1 &#8804; C &#8804; 3.13), shear layers separated from the leading edges form a vortex street downstream of the plate without reattachment to it. Associated force fluctuations on the plate are the main source of acoustic radiation. In the second regime (3.05 &#8804; C &#8804; 9.65), the separated shear layers reattach intermittently to the streamwise plate surfaces. Vortex formation in the shear layer is the dominant cause of sound radiation but the effect becomes weaker as C increases. In the third regime (6.52 &#8804; C &#8804; 68), the separated shear layers form closed leading-edge separation bubbles. Weak vortex shedding, with only a small contribution to the sound radiation, occurs only at the trailing edges of the plate. Bistable behaviour of the flow over a plate, with random switching between the regimes, occurs for C &#8776; 3 and 6.52 &#8804; C &#8804; 9.65. A proposed classification of possible flow regimes for the flow around two plates of rectangular cross-section in tandem has been confirmed experimentally. For small G, the flow in the gap between the plates is isolated from the external flow. When the gap G between the plates is increased to or beyond a critical value (between 2 and 3.5), the shear layers separated from the upstream plate form a von Karman vortex street in the gap before interacting with the downstream plate. Flow and acoustic measurements indicate that this transition is associated with dramatic changes in the flow character.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bluff bodies; Vortex shedding; Acoustic Radiation; Aeroacoustics; plates in Tandem</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between disturbed gastric motor function and enteral nutrition in critically ill patients.</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nam Quoc</field><field name="description">Delayed gastric emptying, that manifests clinically as intolerance to enteral feeding, occurs in over 50% of critically ill patients and has a major impact on patient morbidity and mortality. Despite the recognition that the proximal stomach has a major role in gastric emptying of liquids, only the motor activity of the antro-pyloro-duodenal region has been evaluated in detail. In addition, many of the proposed risk factors for the gastric dysmotility, particularly a prior history of diabetes mellitus, have not been evaluated formally but have been extrapolated from data from non-critically ill patients. The currently available prokinetic drugs, erythromycin and metoclopramide, are considered to be the first line treatment for feed intolerance. However, neither data comparing the effectiveness of these agents nor the data on the effects of combination of therapy in the treatment of feed intolerance are available. The aims of this thesis were, therefore, to examine: (i) proximal gastric motor activity and the association between proximal and distal motility; (ii) the relationship between entero-gastric humoral responses to nutrients, gastric emptying and feed intolerance; (iii) the impact of admission diagnoses, choice of sedations, timing of initiation of feeding, and pre-existing history of diabetes mellitus on gastric emptying and feed intolerance; and (iv) the efficacy of erythromycin, metoclopramide and combination of these drugs in treatment of feed intolerance in critically ill patients. The current thesis indicates that motor activity is impaired in multiple regions of the stomach in the critically ill. When compared to healthy humans, proximal gastric relaxation was prolonged and fundic wave activity was educed during small intestinal nutrient infusion in critically ill patients. In addition, simultaneous assessment of proximal and distal gastric motility demonstrated a possible disruption of the motor integration between the proximal and distal stomach. In light of the recent data that suggested a significantly greater proportion of meal distributed proximally in critically ill patients with delayed gastric emptying (Nguyen, et al. 2006), the disruption of the gastric motor integration and the prolonged gastric relaxation in response to duodenal nutrients may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of slow gastric emptying during critical illness, especially as liquid formulae. The entero-gastric hormonal feedback responses were also disturbed during critical illness. Both fasting and duodenal nutrient-stimulated plasma CCK and PYY concentrations were significantly higher in critically ill patients, particularly those who did not tolerated gastric feeds. The rate of gastric emptying of a liquid meal was inversely related to both fasting and postprandial plasma CCK and PYY concentrations, supporting the potential role of plasma CCK and PYY in the pathogenesis of gastric dysmotility in critically ill patients. Admission diagnosis, choice of sedative drug and blood glucose control but not the timing of enteral feeds were important factors for delayed gastric emptying and feed intolerance in these patients. In particular, delaying enteral feeding by 4 days had no impact on the rate of gastric emptying, intra-gastric meal distribution, or plasma CCK and PYY concentrations. Contrary to traditional belief, critically ill patients with a pre-existing diagnosis of type 2 DM have only a minor disturbance to the proximal stomach, a relatively normal gastric emptying and are at no higher risk of feed intolerance than those without DM, suggesting the presence of pre-existing DM 2 in critically ill patients should not influence the standard practice of gastric feeding. Therapeutically, short-term treatment with low dose erythromycin was more effective than metoclopramide, but the effectiveness decreased rapidly overtime at similar rate as observed with metoclopramide. In patients who failed to response to either agent, treatment with both agents was highly effective in re-establishing feeding success. The use of combination therapy as the initial treatment for feed intolerance was also more effective than erythromycin alone and had less tachyphylaxis. Treatment with erythromycin and metoclopramide, either as a single agent or in combination did not associated with major cardiovascular adverse side effects. Although diarrhoea was a common side effect and was highest with combination therapy, it was not associated with Clostridium difficile infection and settled quickly after the cessation of the prokinetic therapy. In summary, the work performed in the current thesis has provided substantial insights into the understanding of the nature, risk factors, pathogenesis and treatment of disturbed gastric motor function in critically ill patients. Not only do these findings stimulate further research into the mechanisms responsible for gastric dysmotility in critical illness, they also lead to the development of new strategies for optimizing the management of feed intolerance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical illness; gastric motor function; enteral nutrition</field><field name="subject">Enteral feeding</field><field name="subject">Stomach--Motility.</field><field name="subject">Critically ill.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47985</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbon acquisition in variable environments: aquatic plants of the River Murray, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Barrett, Melissa S.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the implications of changes in the supply of resources for photosynthesis, with regard for modes of carbon acquisition employed by aquatic plants of the River Murray. Carbon supplies are inherently more variable for aquatic plants than for those in terrestrial environments, and variations are intensified for plants in semi-arid regions, where water may be limiting. In changeable environments the most successful species are likely to be those with flexible carbon-uptake mechanisms, able to accommodate variations in the supply of resources. Studies were made of plants associated with wetland habitats of the Murray, including Crassula helmsii, Potamogeton tricarinatus, P. crispus and Vallisneria americana. The aim was to elucidate the mechanisms of carbon uptake and assimilation employed, and to determine how flexibility in carbon uptake and/or assimilation physiology affect survival and distribution. Stable carbon isotopes were used to explore the dynamics of carbon uptake and assimilation, and fluorescence was used to identify pathways and photosynthetic capacity. The studies suggest that physiological flexibility is adaptive survival in changeable environments, but probably does not enhance the spread or dominance of these species. V. americana is a known bicarbonate-user, and it is shown here that it uses the Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathway under specific conditions (high light intensity near the leaf tips) concurrently with HCO[subscript]3 - uptake, while leaves deeper in the water continue to use the C[subscript]3 pathway, with CO&#8322; as the main carbon source. However, V. americana does not use CAM when under stress, such as exposure to high light and temperature. The diversity of carbon uptake and assimilation mechanisms in this species may explain its competitive ability in habitats associated with the Murray. In this way it is able to maximise use of light throughout the water column. In shallow, warm water, where leaves are parallel to the surface, CAM ability is likely to be induced along the length of the leaf, allowing maximal use of carbon and light. The amphibious C. helmsii is shown to use CAM on submergence, even where water levels fluctuate within 24 hours. This allows continued photosynthesis in habitats where level fluctuations prevent access to atmospheric CO&#8322;. It appears that stable conditions are most favourable for growth and dispersal, and that the spread of C. helmsii is mainly by the aerial form. Carbon uptake by P. tricarinatus under field conditions is compared with that of P. crispus to demonstrate differences in productivity associated with aqueous bicarbonate and atmospheric CO&#8322; use. P. tricarinatus uses HCO[subscript]3 - uptake to promote growth toward the surface, so that CO&#8322; can be accessed by floating leaves. Atmospheric contact provides access to light and removes the limitation of aqueous diffusive resistance to CO&#8322;, thereby increasing photosynthetic capacity above that provided by submerged leaves.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aquatic photosynthesis; crassulacean acid metabolism; bicarbonate uptake; vallisneria; crassula</field><field name="subject">Crassulaceae.</field><field name="subject">Crassulacean acid metabolism.</field><field name="subject">Photosynthesis.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic plants.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function in children at risk of cardiovascular disease and the effect of folic acid supplementation.</field><field name="creator">Pe&#241;a Vargas, Alexia Sophie</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease secondary to atherosclerosis is the most common cause of human morbidity and mortality. An early and fundamental event in the development of atherosclerosis is abnormal vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function. This can be measured by flow mediated dilatation and glyceryl trinitrate mediated dilatation in children at risk of atherosclerosis. Folic acid improves endothelial function (flow mediated dilatation) in adults with coronary artery disease. No studies have previously investigated the effects of folic acid on vascular function in at risk children with diabetes or obesity. In a cross sectional study an evaluation of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle function and their determinants was performed in 159 children with type 1 diabetes, 58 children with obesity, and 53 healthy children. Children with type 1 diabetes and children with mild to moderate obesity had comparable and severe vascular dysfunction but different determinants. Vascular function in healthy and obese children related to both body mass index and weight (adjusted for age and sex), and blood glucose. Children with obesity had lower folate levels and higher homocysteine levels than children with type 1 diabetes, an abnormal lipid profile and raised inflammatory markers. A randomised double blind placebo controlled cross over trial of 8 weeks of folic acid supplementation was performed in 38 children with type 1 diabetes. In these children, folic acid improved endothelial function with a sustained increase in folate levels but independent of homocysteine levels. Folic acid did not improve smooth muscle function. A randomised double blind placebo controlled parallel trial of 8 weeks folic acid supplementation was performed including 53 obese children. Folic acid did not improve vascular function in obese children in spite of sustained increase in folate levels, and a decrease in homocysteine levels. It was concluded that children with type 1 diabetes and obesity have comparable and severe endothelial and smooth muscle function. Determinants of vascular function in children, including weight and glucose, represent a continuum effect. Folic acid supplementation improved endothelial function in children with type 1 diabetes but not in children with obesity, whose metabolic changes causing endothelial dysfunction differ from children with diabetes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endothelial function; smooth muscle function; type 1 diabetes; obesity, folic acid; children</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Diseases.</field><field name="subject">Children -- Health and hygiene.</field><field name="subject">Overweight children.</field><field name="subject">Folic acid.</field><field name="subject">Vascular smooth muscle.</field><field name="subject">Vascular endothelium.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Complications.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lessons to be learnt: evaluating aspects of patient safety culture and quality improvement within an intensive care unit.</field><field name="creator">Panozzo, Stacey J.</field><field name="description">Patient safety is of particular importance within intensive care units (ICUs), where critically ill, vulnerable patients receive complex multidisciplinary care. Prior research has indicated that improving patient safety and reducing errors within healthcare requires a focus on systems and organisational culture issues. This thesis was concerned with three studies. One focused on assessing the patient safety culture and two on quality improvement initiatives within an intensive care unit (ICU) of a large teaching hospital. The first study involved a survey of ICU consultant, registrar and nursing staff regarding aspects of safety culture. This was conducted using an existing Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture. Of the twelve patient safety culture composites assessed, eight had scores lower than 50%, highlighting these as areas for improvement. Overall, while the survey results revealed that teamwork within the ICU was considered a strength, event reporting and patient care handovers and transitions were both considered areas with potential for improvement. The second study focused on the evaluation of a change initiative designed to improve the handover of patient clinical information in the ICU. This study involved a survey and interviews with consultant, registrar and nursing staff before and after the introduction of a Patient Management, Plan and Progress (PMPP) document. Examination of the survey responses involved both quantitative and qualitative analysis; respondent interview transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. The results of this study revealed resistance to, and criticisms of, the introduction of the PMPP document; the initiative failed and use of the document was discontinued. The second initiative concerned an evaluation of the impact of a hospital-wide document on improving documentation of withdrawal of patient treatment within the ICU. This involved both quantitative and qualitative analysis, with a patient medical record audit of decisions to withdraw patient treatment within the ICU before and after the introduction of an Advance Care Plan (ACP) document. ICU consultant, registrar and nursing staff were interviewed regarding the process of withdrawal of patient treatment within the ICU. Interview transcripts were analysed using a modified grounded theory approach. Results revealed that the attempt to improve the documentation of withdrawal of treatment within the ICU failed, with the ACP document remaining unused in 89% of cases and incomplete in the remaining 11%. Also, documentation of decision-making and of the process within the medical records did not improve. Before-introduction findings revealed that only 26% of medical records met the pre-existing requirements for treatment withdrawal in the ICU, and after-introduction findings revealed that only 19% of medical records audited met the requirements of the ACP document. After-audit findings also revealed significant and inappropriate increases in the involvement of an ICU registrar both as primary and secondary decision-makers. In spite of an increased awareness of ICU staff concerning the importance of improving documentation, the medical record audit revealed less compliance with the standards required for documentation. Possible reasons for the document remaining essentially unused, as revealed from interviews with staff, included: previous criticisms by the coroner when they failed to complete a similar formalised document properly; perceived logistical issues associated with obtaining required staff signatures; disagreement concerning who should be involved in documenting the withdrawal of treatment process; and the existence of an ICU subculture of practice that, in one particular aspect of documentation, was not consistent with established hospital and ICU protocol and documentation requirements. The final chapter of this thesis considered implications of the results of the studies for the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of improvement programs within the ICU setting. The results were considered within the context of organisational change management theory and research, including factors that have been found to be critical in the success or failure of change programs, such as resistance to change, the involvement of key stakeholders in the change process, leadership, communication and organisational culture. It is suggested that management consultants with organisational change expertise in the planning, development, implementation and evaluation of such programs should be involved in future quality improvement initiatives.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patient safety; quality improvement; organisational change; intensive care unit; safety culture; barriers; resistance to change</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine Evaluation.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indian foreign policy and the ambivalence of postcolonial modernity.</field><field name="creator">Chacko, Priya</field><field name="description">India&#8217;s foreign policy behaviour often challenges conventional theories of international relations (IR). Why for instance, did India wait 24 years after its first nuclear test to conduct another test? In the wake of its nuclear tests, why did the political leadership highlight the scientific achievements more than the military implications and why did it characterise India&#8217;s nuclear program as being unique in terms of its restraint and its commitment to total disarmament? Why did India engage in a discourse of friendship with China rather than adopt the anti-communist stance of other democratic states? These are just some of the questions that cannot be adequately explained by the positivist and ahistorical traditions of IR that down-play the connection between state identity and foreign policy or analyse foreign policy as the product of pre-existing realities, subjectivities and interpretive dispositions. An approach that takes into account the historical and cultural context of the construction of state identity however, offers a fuller understanding of India&#8217;s foreign policy behaviour. Using genealogy and the idea of identity performativity, this thesis analyses India&#8217;s foreign policy discourse as a representational practice which, through various codings of sex, gender and race, enacts India&#8217;s postcolonial identity. The thesis uses the findings of five case studies &#8211; India&#8217;s relationship with China, its nuclear politics, its relations with its South Asian neighbours and its interventions in Pakistan and Sri Lanka &#8211; to suggest that a deep ambivalence toward Western modernity lies at the heart of India&#8217;s postcolonial identity and, therefore, the foreign policy discourse that enacts it. This ambivalence arises because, on the one hand, Indian nationalists accepted colonial narratives in which the backwardness of &#8216;Indian civilisation&#8217; led to its degeneration, but on the other hand, they recognised the need to advance a critique of Western modernity and its deep imbrication with colonialism. The result is a striving for a postcolonial modernity that is not only imitative but strives to be distinctly different and superior to Western modernity by being culturally and morally grounded. Thus, India is fashioned as a postcolonial civilisational-state that brings to international affairs a tradition of morality and ethical conduct which it derives from its civilisational heritage. This thesis argues that in order to comprehend the apparently inexplicable aspects of Indian foreign policy it is crucial to understand this self-fashioning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">India; foreign policy; identity; postcolonialism</field><field name="subject">Postcolonialism India.</field><field name="subject">India Foreign relations 1984-</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Six studies pointing to the need for a biopsychosocial approach to treating common gastrointestinal and hepatologic disorders.</field><field name="creator">Mikocka-Walus, Antonina</field><field name="description">Background and aims: This interdisciplinary thesis was designed to deepen understanding of the co-morbidity of anxiety and depression with chronic diseases of the digestive tract, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in particular. The first part of the thesis aimed to explore the prevalence of psychological problems in IBD compared to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and chronic hepatitis C (HCV) groups. It also explored the relationship between the number of co-morbid functional gastrointestinal disorders and the severity of psychological problems in IBD and IBS. It also aimed to determine whether there is a relationship between psychological problems and the response to standard medical treatment/physical outcomes in patients with IBD, IBS and HCV. Furthermore, it aimed to explore whether disclosure of the psychological status of depressed and/or anxious IBD patients to their gastroenterologists influences doctors&#8217; behaviour and affects patients&#8217; responses to treatment/physical outcomes. The second part of the thesis aimed to investigate the potential role of antidepressants in IBD and to determine the feasibility of future randomised controlled trials on the role of antidepressants in IBD. Methods: Overall, a cohort of 139 outpatients (64 IBD, 41 HCV, and 34 IBS) and 18 gastroenterologists participated in the six studies comprising this thesis. A mixed methods design was applied. Two cross-sectional studies, an observational cohort prospective management study, a randomised controlled trial, a systematic review and an exploratory interview study were conducted. Differences between the groups for continuous variables were assesed with one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent samples ttests. Differences in categorical variables were assessed with contingency tables with the Chi-Square test and the Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test. Propsective analyses were conducted with repeated measures ANOVA, logistic regression and Poisson regression. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results: Overall, 42% of participants were anxious and 19% were depressed. Participants with HCV had higher levels of psychological impairment compared with the IBS, the IBD group and the general population (p&lt;0.05). Those IBD participants with fewer co-morbid functional disorders had better physical quality of life than participants with a greater number of these disorders (p=0.025). Moreover, depression/anxiety at baseline did not explain medical outcomes after 12 months in this cohort of patients with chronic diseases of the digestive tract. Doctors&#8217; knowledge of patients&#8217; psychological status was found to have no impact on IBD patients&#8217; outcomes after 12 months. However, interestingly, the level of anxiety in IBD participants significantly dropped between the baseline and nine months indicating a possible benefit from participating in the study. In the literature review, insufficient evidence was found to conclude that antidepressants are efficacious for treatment of psychological co-morbidities or somatic complaints in IBD. However, the qualitative interview study indicated a potential positive impact of treatment with antidepressants on coping with disease symptoms and general wellbeing in patients with IBD. Conclusion: The thesis confirms that there is a significant burden of psychological co-morbidity in patients with chronic gastroenterological diseases. Interdisciplinary approaches to the management of these diseases are therefore warranted in Australian gastroenterology clinics. Anxiety targeted interventions and research in this setting are urgently needed, especially with respect to patients with HCV. Larger studies exploring the gastroenterologists&#8217; role in treatment of co-morbid psychological problems in their patients are recommended. Longer prospective studies on homogenous samples of patients are also needed to clarify the nature of the relationship between psychological problems and relapse of somatic symptoms. Finally, randomised controlled trials exploring the efficacy of antidepressants in IBD are warranted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biopsychosocial; inflammation; bowel disease; depression; anxiety; quality of life; antidepressants; irritable bowel syndrome; chronic hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Gastroenterology.</field><field name="subject">Gastroenterology Psychological aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross cultural study of entrepreneurial competencies and entrepreneurial success in SMEs in Australia and Malaysia.</field><field name="creator">Ahmad, Noor Hazlina</field><field name="description">The present study examined the relationship between entrepreneurial competencies and business success in the context of SMEs in Australia and Malaysia. A &#8220;mixed-method&#8221; approach was adopted whereby two studies were conducted in a sequential fashion (Study 1 and Study 2). In Study 1, a qualitative method was adopted in which individual interviews were conducted with 20 entrepreneurs &#8211; 10 from Australia and 10 from Malaysia &#8211; who operated SMEs in the manufacturing and service sectors. The aim was to elicit behaviours that delineate competencies, and thus enable the identification of entrepreneurial competencies that are context-specific and of relevance in the current business environment. A content analysis of the interview data identified 12 competency domains: Strategic; Commitment; Conceptual; Opportunity; Organising and Leading; Relationship; Learning; Personal; Technical; Ethical; Social Responsibility; and Familism. Importantly, nine of these categories were well represented in existing models of entrepreneurial competencies, thereby providing evidence that these models offer a reasonable degree of cross-cultural generalisability. However, three new categories emerged, namely, Ethical, Social Responsibility, and Familism (broadly concerned with the role of &#8220;family&#8221; in building business success). There was evidence for Ethical and Social Responsibility competencies in both the Australian and Malaysian data, whereas Familism was specific to the Malaysian data and may well reflect the collectivist orientation of Malaysian culture. The identification of these additional categories of entrepreneurial competencies suggests that the existing models may need to be revised to further enhance their applicability to the measurement of entrepreneurial competencies in different cultural contexts. Study 2 Part 1 proceeded with validating the model of entrepreneurial competencies. This involved determining the psychometric rigour of the model and establishing the psychometric properties of all dependent variables (measures of business success) and covariates (i.e., business environment and entrepreneurs&#8217; cultural orientations) using a sample of 391 SME entrepreneurs (179 Australians and 212 Malaysians). The two best fit models of entrepreneurial competencies &#8211; the &#8220;Comprehensive&#8221; model and the &#8220;Parsimonious&#8221; model &#8211; are fully described. The Comprehensive model revealed that all twelve competency areas were perceived as relevant to SME outcomes by entrepreneurs in Australia and Malaysia, even though the behaviours that defined the Organising and Leading competency domain, as well as the Familism competency domain (later renamed &#8220;Supporting and Cooperating&#8221; for Australia due to the omission of items related to &#8220;family&#8221;) were somewhat different. The other 10 competency areas identified in the Comprehensive model appeared to be invariant across countries. On the other hand, the Parsimonious model of entrepreneurial competencies showed that, although some competency areas were universal in nature (i.e., Conceptual, Opportunity, Learning, and Ethical), others were country specific (i.e., Relationship, Social Responsibility, and Familism). It was argued that the differences could be traced to cultural variations between the countries, in particular the extent of Individualism versus Collectivism. Study 2 Part 2 tested the causal pathway between entrepreneurial competencies and business success and the possible influence of covariates using a structural equation modeling (SEM) procedure. The results showed that entrepreneurial competencies were strong predictors of business success in SMEs for both Australia and Malaysia. It was also found that both Benign and Stable business environments were significantly related to business success in Australia whereas only a Stable environment was significantly linked with success in Malaysia. Moreover, environmental variables showed a less strong path to success than competencies. When the Parsimonious model of entrepreneurial competencies was used in the model estimation, the association between entrepreneurial competencies and business success was more strongly evident in Hostile and Dynamic environments than in more Benign and Stable environments (for both Australia and Malaysia). The results also showed that cultural orientations (both Collectivism and Tolerance for Ambiguity) have positive effects on entrepreneurial competencies in Malaysia but not in Australia (i.e., Individualism and Tolerance for Ambiguity). The effect of education on entrepreneurial competencies was mixed; significant for only the Comprehensive model for Australia but significant for both Comprehensive and Parsimonious models for Malaysia. The effects of training before and after start up, as well as previous work experience on entrepreneurial competencies appeared to be nonsignificant in both contexts. On the basis of the results of the thesis, it was concluded that self-reported entrepreneurial competencies are predictive of self-reports of success in both Malaysian and Australian SMEs. The models that describe success in both countries are consistent with existing models of entrepreneurial competency although differences in the behaviours that define a domain are evidenced between countries as are the domains that successfully define a parsimonious model in each country. These results are interpreted as supporting a training agenda that identifies entrepreneurial skills as a critical pre-requisite to business success for SMEs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">entrepeneurial competencies; entrepreneurial success; cross cultural study; Australia; Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Entrepreneurship Australia.

About a billion people live in extreme poverty and more than 800 million do not get adequate nutrition. Third World Debt looms large on the horizons of most underdeveloped nations and development continues to benefit the Third World elites, the developed nations, and their multinational corporations. The North-South divide continues to widen with very little &#8220;tricking down&#8221; to the poor majority in many nations. It is strongly believed that one-third of the world&#8217;s poor are getting poorer. The conventional approach to development theory and practice, focusing on economic growth, investment, trade and free markets continues to benefit developed nations. Even in nations where free trade and markets have spurred growth, the net results of globalization have not reached the majority. Globalization defined as the &#8220;economic, social, political and environmental integration of nations&#8221; creates some major imbalances in a world system increasingly based on liberal market economies. Ultimately, the IMF-WTO corporate globalization model has failed to deliver for developing countries, severely punishing those least capable of protecting themselves &#8211; the billions living on $ 400 million annually. Market access is only useful to countries at a stage of development that allows for their engagement in world markets, in a manner that promotes improved standards of living for their populations. The promise of market access is a distraction that has served to create a myth of prosperity. This research seeks to raise issues regarding the impact of globalization on North-South imbalances highlighting the crucial gaps in the globalization process. Initially, the research outlines the parameters and theories surrounding the globalization process and then progresses on to demonstrate the imbalances of the global system, highlighting the key areas of impact that adversely affect the development of Southern nations. Using India&#8217;s economic liberalization as a case in point, this thesis attempts to unveil the growing myth of prosperity that is being propagated in relation to the issues of globalization and the South. Finally, the thesis attempts to draw pertinent theoretical lessons that would contribute towards a better understanding of the effects of globalization on the South.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalization; global South; North-South imbalance; myth of prosperity</field><field name="subject">Globalization Economic aspects Developing countries.</field><field name="subject">Developing countries Economic conditions.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modelling and optimal design of a three degree-of-freedom XY&#952;z micro-motion stage.</field><field name="creator">Handley, Daniel Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation of the modelling and optimal design of a particular 3-degree-of-freedom (DOF) XY&#952;z micro-motion stage. This stage provides micron-scale motion in X and Y directions and a rotation about the Z-axis. Such a stage can be used for applications where positioning of components with micrometre, or even nanometre positioning accuracy is required. Some applications are; the positioning of samples in a scanning-electron-microscope; the positioning of masks in lithography; aligning fibre-optics and lasers; and manipulation of micro-scale objects in micro-biology or micro-systems assembly. The XY&#952;z micro-motion stage investigated in this study uses a particular topology of monolithic compliant mechanism and three stack piezoelectric actuators. The compliant mechanism used is a 3RRR (three revolute-revolute-revolute) parallel compliant mechanism using flexure hinges. This parallel mechanism uses three RRR linkages. Each of the three RRR linkages uses three circular profile flexure hinges. Each flexure hinge provides predominantly rotational motion about one axis. This topology of mechanism has a symmetrical structure and provides numerous advantages that make it appropriate for use in a micro-motion stage. However, as yet this topology of compliant mechanism has only been investigated by a handful of researchers and it has not been used in any commercially developed systems. The design methodology of a stage using the 3RRR compliant mechanism has not been investigated in detail. In this thesis a study is presented that investigates different approaches to model the 3RRR compliant mechanism and also considers the piezo-actuator modelling, to give the complete XY&#952;z micro-motion stage. Three models are presented and compared; the Pseudo-Rigid-Body Model (PRBM); a two-dimensional Finite-Element-Model (2-D FEM); and a third model is developed that is similar to the PRBM, but uses analytical equations to model the multiple degree-of-freedom compliance of the flexure hinges. The models developed are then used in parametric study so that the relationship between design parameters and output behaviour can be understood. An optimal design approach is then presented to develop an XY&#952;z micro-motion stage for a particular application in a Scanning-Electron-Microscope (SEM). Finally experimental validation of the models is presented. The results of this study indicate which modelling approaches are accurate enough to prove useful for design, while also considering which models are computationally simple enough to be efficient and easy to use. The kinematic and dynamic behaviour of the 3RRR compliant mechanism and XY&#952;z micro-motion stage is discussed in detail. This includes; a comprehensive description of the stage workspace, defining reachable and constant-rotation workspace areas; a discussion of actuator coupling; and in depth investigation of the modes of vibration. The results of the parametric study provide useful insight to aid the design of the XYz micro-motion stage and help simplify optimal design. The parametric study also highlights the difference in trends predicted by different modelling methods, which demonstrates the importance of using an appropriate model in design. The experimental validation demonstrates the accuracy of some modelling approaches while highlighting the limited accuracy of others.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">machine design; manipulators (mechanism); mechanical movements; hinges; finite element method; micro-motion stage; XY&#952;z stage; compliant mechanism; 3RRR compliant mechanism; flexure hinge modelling; pseudo-rigid-body model</field><field name="subject">Manipulators (Mechanism).</field><field name="subject">Hinges -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Finite element method -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Machine design.</field><field name="subject">Mechanical movements.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny and evolution of Lerista (Lygosominae, Scincidae, Squamata).</field><field name="creator">Skinner, Adam</field><field name="description">In this thesis, I investigate the phylogeny and evolution of Lerista, a clade of more than 75 species of scincid lizards, distributed in arid, semi-arid, and seasonally dry habitats throughout Australia. Among extant tetrapods, Lerista is exceptional in comprising a large number of closely-related species displaying prodigious variability of body form; several species possessing well-developed, pentadactyl limbs resemble typical non-fossorial scincids in body proportions, while many other species exhibit varying degrees of limb reduction and body elongation, including two that are highly elongate and entirely limbless. The extensive variation in limb morphology observed among species, incorporating at least 20 distinct phalangeal configurations, has prompted some authors to identify Lerista as the best available model for studying limb reduction in squamates. Nonetheless, lack of a well-resolved phylogeny has impeded investigation of the pattern and mode of limb reduction and loss within the clade. The primary goal of my research was to furnish a comprehensive phylogenetic hypothesis for Lerista, enabling more sophisticated study of the evolution of limb morphology and body form in this clade than has previously been possible. A recent phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences for a series of Australian Sphenomorphus group scincids (including two species of Lerista) recovered several well-supported, major clades, although these were generally separated by relatively short branches associated with low support values. Applying a recently described methodology for inferring lineage-level polytomies, I use ATP synthetase-&#946; subunit intron sequences and the existing mitochondrial DNA data set (with sequences for additional taxa) to assess the hypothesis that the poorly resolved basal relationships within the Australian Sphenomorphus group are a consequence of the major clades having originated essentially simultaneously. Phylogenetic analyses of the separate mitochondrial DNA and intron sequence data reveal a number of congruent clades, however, the relationships among these clades indicated by the two data sets are generally incongruent. Although this may be partly ascribed in to error in estimating phylogenetic relationships due to insufficient data, some incongruence is evident when uncertainty in inferred relationships is allowed for. Moreover, the congruent clades are typically separated by very short branches, several having a length insignificantly different from zero. These results suggest that initial diversification of Australian Sphenomorphus group scincids was rapid relative to the substitution rates of the mitochondrial DNA and intron fragments considered, if not essentially simultaneous. The pattern and rate of limb reduction in Lerista are investigated, employing a nearly complete phylogeny inferred from nucleotide sequences for a nuclear intron and six mitochondrial genes. Ancestral digit configurations reconstructed assuming this phylogeny indicate at least ten independent reductions in the number of digits from a pentadactyl condition, including four independent losses of all digits, three from pentadactyl or tetradactyl conditions. At the highest rate, complete loss of digits from a pentadactyl condition is estimated to have occurred within no more than 3.6 million years. Patterns of digit loss for the manus and pes are consistent with selection for preserving hindlimb utility as the limbs are reduced, and suggest that intermediate digit configurations exhibited by extant species do not represent transitory stages in a continuing process of limb reduction. An increase in the relative length of the body is demonstrated to precede digit loss in lineages experiencing substantial reduction of the limbs, supporting the hypothesis that limb reduction and loss is a consequence of the adoption of lateral undulation as a significant locomotory mode. However, less extensive limb reduction may proceed in the absence of body elongation, perhaps due to a decrease in absolute body size. The exceptionally high frequency and rate of limb reduction in Lerista emphasise the potential for rapid and dramatic evolutionary transformation of body form in squamates. The substantial divergence of relative limb and body length evident within Lerista is more readily explained by the correlated progression model of phenotypic transformation than the independent blocks model. At each step in the attainment of a limb-reduced, elongate body form, alterations to the relative length of the limbs are accompanied by changes in relative snout-vent length (or vice versa) enabling the maintenance of locomotory ability. Nonetheless, some dissociation of hindlimb reduction and body elongation is possible, emphasising the potentially variable intensity of functional constraints and, accordingly, that the independent blocks model and correlated progression are extremes of a continuum of models (each invoking a different degree of functional integration) and do not describe discrete categories of phenotypic change. An increase in the extent of seasonally dry and arid habitats coincident with the origination of Lerista would have facilitated limb reduction and body elongation by furnishing an environment conducive to the adoption of fossorial habits, however, trends toward a limbless, highly elongate body form may be attributed primarily to the very low probability of re-elaborating reduced limbs. Such asymmetry in the probabilities of possible phenotypic changes may be a significant cause of evolutionary trends resulting in the emergence of higher taxa.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phylogeny; evolution; Lerista; skink; lizard</field><field name="subject">Skinks -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Skinks -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Lizards -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="subject">Lygosoma -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Lygosoma -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="subject">Squamata -- Classification.</field><field name="subject">Squamata -- Phylogeny.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of markers associated with systemic inflammation in children with Chronic Kidney Disease.</field><field name="creator">Nairn, Judith</field><field name="description">Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that in the majority of cases leads to End Stage Renal Failure (ESRD) and the need for dialysis, with the only cure being renal transplant. CKD affects both adults and children; however the underlying causes of the disease are different. CKD in adults is most commonly secondary to diabetes and/or hypertension while CKD in children is usually caused by congenital structural abnormalities that result directly in renal dysfunction. There have been numerous reports of inflammatory and immunological disturbances in adult CKD that involve both the cellular and humoral immune systems. Consequences of these include an increased rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD), decreased response to vaccinations, as well as increased rates of infection, anaemia and malnutrition. Children with CKD display many of the clinical complications seen in adult kidney disease that are associated with inflammatory and immunological changes. In adults however, many of the primary conditions associated with CKD are inherently pro-inflammatory; therefore it is not clear whether the inflammatory changes observed in adults with CKD are due to pre-existing inflammatory conditions, renal disease per se or a combination of both. The majority of CKD in children is caused by conditions that are not inflammatory in nature. This presents a unique opportunity to study the inflammatory consequences of CKD alone, without the added complication of underlying inflammatory disorders. Despite this, there has been little investigation of the inflammatory and immunological status of children with CKD. Some very recent studies have shown that children with CKD have an increased systemic inflammatory state[1-3], however the nature of these immunological and inflammatory changes remains poorly defined. Identification of the specific inflammatory processes that occur in CKD may provide new treatment targets and the opportunity to develop urgently needed new therapies. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the presence of immunological changes associated with inflammation in children with CKD. This is the first study to include children with very mild disease, and the significant changes that are present in the early stages of the disease are of particular note. I have shown that CKD in children is an intrinsically inflammatory condition, with increased accumulation of markers of oxidative stress and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The inflammatory markers identified in this study may be applied as a foundation for more sensitive diagnostic markers of disease progression as well as provide a basis for novel treatment strategies in this group of patients. Early identification of increased inflammation is a prerequisite for the application of preventive strategies. In addition, a better understanding of the level and mechanisms of systemic inflammation in children with CKD may enable a more accurate assessment of their risk of other inflammatory conditions such as CVD, anaemia, muscle wasting, and malnutrition. Future research that specifically focuses on the reasons and mechanisms for different rates of disease progression may emerge as a result of this study. Importantly, the findings of this study may have implications in the long term treatment of disease and may allow identification of new treatment strategies to achieve better patient outcomes. The outcomes of the study are: &#8226; Better definition of inflammatory profiles in paediatric CKD and correlation with disease severity and progression, which should contribute to improved management strategies. &#8226; Identification of new treatment targets to reduce the damage caused by chronic systemic inflammation. &#8226; Mechanistic understanding of the relationship of the inflammatory profile in regard to source leucocytes or other contributing cell types.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">children; chronic kidney disease; inflammation; cytokines; T cells</field><field name="subject">Kidney disease.</field><field name="subject">Pediatric nephrology.</field><field name="subject">Cytokines.</field><field name="subject">T cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The future of radiofrequency ablation is looking BETA : short and long term studies of bimodal electric tissue ablation (BETA) in a porcine model.</field><field name="creator">Dobbins, Christopher</field><field name="description">Introduction: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a popular method of treating unresectable liver tumours by the use of a high frequency, alternating electrical current that heats and destroys tumour cells. The size of the ablation is limited by localised charring of adjacent tissue that prevents further conduction of the radiofrequency current. In the clinical setting, this results in increased rates of local recurrence in tumours that are greater than 3 cm in diameter as multiple, overlapping ablations need to be performed to treat the one tumour. To overcome this problem, a modified form of RFA called Bimodal Electric Tissue Ablation (BETA) has been created. BETA adds a direct electrical current to the alternating radiofrequency current, thus establishing its bimodal character. When direct currents are used in biological tissues, water is transferred from anode to cathode by a process called electro-osmosis. By attaching the cathode to the radiofrequency electrode, water is attracted to the area thus preventing tissue desiccation and charring. The BETA circuit has been constructed and tested using a porcine model. The aims of the studies are to confirm that larger ablations can be produced with the BETA system and that it is safe to use in an animal model. Three studies have been performed to test these aims in porcine liver. Methods: The first study was designed to compare sizes of the ablation produced between standard RFA and the BETA circuit. This was followed by a long-term study to assess associated changes to liver function and pathological changes within the liver as well as identifying any other treatment related morbidity. The third study assessed the difference in ablation size and safety aspects when the positive electrode of the direct current circuitry was moved from small surface area under the skin to a large surface area on the skin. Results: Ablations with significantly larger diameters are created with the BETA circuit using a multi-tine needle (49.55 mm versus 27.78 mm, p&lt;0.001). This finding was confirmed in the third experiment using a straight needle (25 mm versus 15.33 mm, p&lt;0.001). Ablations produced by the BETA circuit induce coagulative necrosis within the treated liver and the injury heals by fibrosis in a manner similar to other thermal therapies. Significant rises in some serum liver enzymes are seen within 24 hours of treatment but these return to normal within 4 days. An electrolytic type injury can be produced at the site of the positive electrode. By increasing the surface area of this electrode, the risk of tissue damage is decreased but ablations are significantly smaller (18 mm versus 25 mm, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: The BETA circuit consistently produces significantly larger ablations than RFA. The treatment appears safe but positioning of the positive electrode of the direct current requires careful consideration. Injuries produced behave like other thermal therapies with coagulative necrosis followed by fibrotic healing. As larger ablations are consistently produced, it is hypothesised that with further refinements, tumours greater than 3 cm in diameter could be treated with lower rates of recurrence.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiofrequency ablation; RFA; liver tumours; liver treatment; bimodal electric tissue ablation</field><field name="subject">Catheter ablation</field><field name="subject">Liver--Tumors--Treatment.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the Fergusonina fly and Fergusobia nematode gall association in South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Head, Elise</field><field name="description">Attempts were made to grow Fergusobia nematodes in a dual aseptic culture with Eucalyptus camaldulensis. Callus tissue was grown from E. camaldulensis stem pieces in aseptic conditions. Calli were prone to deterioration after 14 days unless transferred to fresh growth medium. Lower levels of solutes (25% Murashige and Skoog salts, 25% plant vitamins and 0.5% sucrose) were more successful than published concentrations. Fergusobia J2 nematodes were surface sterilised with either Hibitane or washed with water to prepare them for inoculation of callus (Hay, 1994). Fergusobia subsequently recovered from plates of callus were all dead, which raised questions of how the nematodes are suited to Murashige and Skoog salt solutions. The survival of Fergusobia in aqueous solutions was then observed. It has been assumed that Fergusobia live about 2 days after dissection. Amphimictic nematodes from E. camaldulensis axial bud galls were used for a survival study. Nematodes lived for as long as 12 days in fresh tap water and 11 days in 1% M.S. solution. They were more active in tap water than in 1% M.S. solution. Nematodes in a dish together with dissected gall material died within 2 days. Nematodes in a separate dish with fresh tap water and clean gall fibres were observed to gather around the fibres. Observations of Fergusobia could be made within fresh solutions providing deteriorating gall tissues were removed from the dish. Gall production was attempted on E. camaldulensis grown in the glasshouse. These tree saplings were pruned to encourage new growth and periodically treated for infestations of scale insects leading to growth of sooty mould. Two forms of cage construction were used: (1) 1 m &#179; screened cages and (2) acetate sleeves as used by Goolsby et al., 2000. Within the 1 m &#179; cages containing flies, the growing points on saplings were blackened, possibly due to over-exploitation by ovipositing flies. One growing point caged in an acetate sleeve showed oviposition scars but did not produce a mature gall. Production of galls in the glasshouse was hindered by a lack in coincidence of flies emerging from mature galls and the flush of new growth following pruning. The production of galls within the glasshouse was not achieved. The phenology of E. camaldulensis, a host for the Fergusonina/Fergusobia mutualism, and gall ecology were observed in a two-year, non-destructive, field study in the Urrbrae Wetlands, Adelaide, South Australia. Tree growth and gall development was observed in the lower regions (0 &#8211; 2 m) of young trees. Three bud forms, terminal leaf bud, axial leaf bud and flower bud galls were monitored on the trees. The densities of galls were highly seasonal. Greatest density of growing points, axial leaf bud and flower bud galls occurred mostly during mid-winter to spring, whereas that of terminal leaf bud galls occurred during mid-spring to summer. Galling of flower buds did not appear to influence flowering and more flower buds and flowers occurred in the second year of the study as the trees matured. Trees mostly had medium (30-70%) levels of leaf damage, but there were seasonal trends in damage levels. Low scores for leaf damage were associated with increases in flower bud and flower production. Leaf damage, including sooty mould, appeared to increase during the cooler winter months. There were no significant seasonal relationships between levels of leaf damage and either growing point density or the occurrence of galls. When trees were compared with each other, those with lower leaf damage were more likely to have more growing points. The appearance of the canopy and the likelihood of a tree to have galls varied greatly between the trees. One tree was particularly susceptible to leaf attack, rarely had new leaves and produced no mature galls during the study. The colouring of leaves varied between trees, which indicates possible genetic variations causing some trees to be more likely hosts for Fergusonina/Fergusobia. Both new vegetative growth and terminal leaf bud galls were concentrated on the northern and eastern quadrants. Axial leaf bud and flower bud galls occurred more on the western or southern quadrants where they were possibly more protected from sun exposure on the northern or eastern quadrants. Axial galls on the northern side of one tree became reddened while those in the southern and western quadrants remained green. Reddening of axial galls may increase their likelihood of parasitism and predation by birds. Each of the three gall forms occurred within certain positions in the canopy. The tree host resource is partitioned effectively, with the three gall forms occurring on three different host structures. Additionally, the two vegetative forms terminal leaf bud and axial leaf bud galls occur on different shoot regions and in different seasons. The numbers of the galls is probably also affected by biotic and climatic influences. Parasitism, plant canopy shading, nutrient levels and host genetics are possible influences. Assuming an interval of 4 weeks between oviposition and first observation within the current study, terminal leaf bud galls had an average longevity of 11 weeks and axial leaf bud galls an average longevity of 14 weeks. Flower bud galls had longevities of 14 to 27 weeks from oviposition to senescence, assuming an interval of 6 weeks between oviposition and first observation within the current study. Flowers and flower buds occur irregularly within the eucalypts so it would be advantageous for flies and nematodes developing within flower bud galls to have extended or variable longevities to allow fly emergences to coincide with new flower buds. Not all of the galls recorded matured to produce adult flies. Nearly half of the terminal leaf bud galls initiated were aborted, recorded as absent, parasitised or eaten (45% of initiated galls). Of the three gall forms, they were the most prone to obvious parasitism and as many as 12 hymenopteran species have been reared from terminal leaf bud galls on E. camaldulensis (Taylor et al., 1996). These galls obviously provide a resource for many species within multiple trophic levels. Fourteen percent of axial leaf bud galls were absent or eaten and birds were seen breaking off and feeding on the galls. More than half (55%) of the initiated flower bud galls disappeared during the period of observation, possibly due to the foraging of birds. Destructive sampling and rearing out of parasitoids from both axial leaf bud and flower bud gall forms is needed to establish what species exist within them. Terminal leaf bud galls ranged from 7.5 to 30.1 mm in diameter and 10.0 to 43.6 mm in length. Flower bud gall size varied, with the largest being 15.0 mm by 22.3 mm. Axial leaf bud galls, ranged from 2.6 to 13.0 mm in diameter and length ranged from 2.3 to 10.5 mm. The larger axial leaf bud galls were nodular and appeared to have multiple locules. Destructive sampling and rearing out of flies is needed to establish the relationship between size and numbers of flies emerging. Terminal leaf bud galls increased in size, including many locules and exit holes per gall. Axial leaf bud galls were much smaller than the terminal leaf bud galls and 99% had only one to three exit holes. The rounded shape and presence of few locules within the axial leaf bud galls indicate that this form is limited to a shape and size producing few flies. The observation of greater size of terminal leaf bud galls suggests that these galls may have multiple foundresses. Twelve of the 13 flower bud galls with exit holes had either one or two holes. In flower bud galls on E. camaldulensis. the operculum remains sealed and the characteristic Fergusonina &#8220;window&#8221; appears at the side of the flower bud before fly emergence through a single hole. Destructive sampling is also necessary to determine parasitism of each of the gall forms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nematode; fly; gall; ecology</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus camaldulensis--Diseases and pests--South Australia</field><field name="subject">Nematoda.</field><field name="subject">Galls (Botany)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of nutrition on postharvest quality and grey mould development in strawberries.</field><field name="creator">Naradisorn, Matchima</field><field name="description">Strawberries are an extremely perishable fruit mainly due to their soft texture and sensitivity to fungal infection. The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea is responsible for grey mould on strawberries and is the main causal agent of postharvest decay and subsequent economic loss. As an alternative to fungicides, manipulation of plant nutrition, such as calcium and boron, has been suggested as a means of disease management. This project investigated the effects of calcium and boron application on fruit quality and grey mould development in strawberry. The effect of calcium on fruit quality, grey mould development and leaf blight in strawberry cultivars &#8216;Aromas&#8217; and &#8216;Selva&#8217; was investigated through preharvest and postharvest applications. To determine the effect of preharvest application, calcium sulphate in 0.25X strength Hoagland&#8217;s solution was applied at 0, 100, 300 and 500 ppm Ca through fertigation. Fully-ripened fruit were harvested and evaluated for postharvest quality at harvest and then after storage at 10&#8304;C, 90&#177;5% RH for 2 to 10 days. Although fruit firmness of both cultivars declined slightly during storage, this was not affected by preharvest calcium application. Similarly, preharvest calcium treatment had no effect on the external appearance, pH, soluble solids content (SSC) or titratable acidity (TA). No grey mould development was observed on fruit at harvest when flowers were inoculated with a conidia suspension of B. cinerea (10&#8308; conidia per mL). However, fruit harvested from plants that received calcium at any concentration had less incidence of grey mould during storage at 10&#8304;C, 90&#177;5% RH for 14 days than fruit harvested from plants that received no calcium for both cultivars. For &#8216;Aromas&#8217;, 79% and 51% of fruit, and for &#8216;Selva&#8217;, 69% and 43% of fruit, showed rot when treated with 0 and 500 ppm Ca, respectively. The shelf life of &#8216;Aromas&#8217; and &#8216;Selva&#8217; increased by about 8% when plants received 500 ppm Ca in comparison with plants that received 0 ppm Ca. After 7 days of incubation at 22 to 24&#8304;C, there was no difference between blight lesions on wound-inoculated detached leaves from different calcium treatments for either cultivar. However, the lesions on &#8216;Selva&#8217; were smaller than on &#8216;Aromas&#8217;. The calcium levels in leaves from plants that received calcium at any concentration were adequate for strawberry growing and significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) than in leaves from plants that received 0 ppm Ca. However, calcium treatment did not ensure transfer of calcium to fruit tissues. Calcium lactate and calcium chloride were used as postharvest calcium treatments at 1500, 3000 and 4500 ppm Ca. Fruit of &#8216;Selva&#8217; were dipped in calcium solution for 5 min and wound-inoculated with B. cinerea (10&#8310; conidia per mL). Calcium lactate and calcium chloride at 3000 and 4500 ppm Ca, respectively, were most effective in delaying Botrytis rot development on &#8216;Selva&#8217; after 7 days of storage at 10&#8304;C, 90&#177;5% RH. Storage for least 24 h after calcium dips prior to inoculation was required to delay the development of fruit rot. Fruit harvested early in the season seemed to be less susceptible to grey mould than those harvested later. However, calcium treatment tended to be more effective when applied to late-season fruit. Preharvest boron treatment, applied as for calcium but at 0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 ppm B, had no effect on fruit firmness of either cultivar. However, firmness of &#8216;Aromas&#8217; fruit was slightly greater than &#8216;Selva&#8217; fruit for all treatments. The amount of boron applied had no effect on the external appearance, pH, SSC or TA for either cultivar after storage of fruit for up to 10 days. Application of boron had no effect on fruit grey mould development in either cultivar. Furthermore, boron had minimal effect on the incidence of blight on woundinoculated detached leaves of &#8216;Aromas&#8217; 7 days after inoculation. However, blight lesion diameters on &#8216;Selva&#8217; leaves in the 1.0 ppm B treatment (8.0 mm) were significantly smaller (P &lt; 0.001) than in the 0 ppm B treatment (13.0 mm). Phytotoxicity was observed in boron treatments even at the level considered optimum for strawberry growing. Severity increased with increasing boron concentration but no consistent effect on flower death or flower abortion was observed. In conclusion, strawberry is sensitive to boron toxicity. Calcium may enhance fruit firmness and, consequently, delay grey mould development if calcium penetrates the fruit. Postharvest calcium treatment tended to be more effective in delaying development of grey mould when applied to late-season fruit. Calcium lactate is a potential alternative to calcium chloride for reducing decay caused by B. cinerea in strawberry without providing undesirable bitterness. This finding may provide a basis for application in industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">calcium; boron; Botrytis; postharvest; strawberry; grey mould</field><field name="subject">Strawberries Diseases and pests.

Salt accumulation is a major soil constraint for agricultural sustainability in arable or newly cultivated soils. As a result of salinity, soil chemical, physical and biological properties deteriorate, plant uptake of water and nutrients, particularly P, decreases and plant growth declines. Application of plant residues can enhance the activity of soil microorganisms, the availability of nutrients, including P and the plant uptake of P and growth. Such a practice can also be economically viable as it can reduce the use of P from inorganic sources, maintaining the world&#8217;s reserve of P rocks and reducing the price of fertilizers and the environmental pollution often associated with the excessive application of inorganic N and P fertilizers. Little is known about how P, with N in proper form, added from inorganic and/or residue sources can affect wheat growth in the salt affected soils with no confounding pH or sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Increasing microbial activity, N and P availability and wheat uptake of P by application of N and P from organic and inorganic sources may improve wheat growth and hence productivity under saline conditions. The overall aim of this study was to determine ways for enhancing the activity of microorganisms and increasing the availability of N and P, the uptake of nutrients, particularly P and the growth of wheat by management of fertilization from inorganic and organic sources in saline soils. This study therefore was conducted with the following aims: 1) to investigate the relationship between salinity and P availability; 2) to assess wheat response to combined application of N and P fertilizers under saline conditions; 3) to evaluate the effect of plant residue addition on N and P availability and microbial activity in salt affected soils; 4) to determine microbial response to addition of inorganic N rate and form, and how this will affect N and P availability in a saline soil, and 5) to determine the effect of P added from inorganic fertilizer and plant residue, compared to inorganic P fertilization, on microbial biomass and wheat nutrient composition and growth in a saline soil. In saline soils, P availability can be affected by the salt type and concentration and soil texture. Three experiments were conducted to study the relationship between P availability, soil texture and salinity. The results of the first experiment in which soil was shaken with different concentrations of NaCl or CaCl2 or Na2SO4, indicated that P solubility decreased with increasing concentration of Ca2+, but was not affected by Na+ salts. In the second experiment, P availability (after 24h shaking) decreased with increasing salt concentration up to EC1:5 3.1 dS m-1, increased with increasing P addition (0, 100, 200, 400, 600, 1200, 2500 and 5000 &#181;g P g-1 soil), and was generally higher in sandy soil than in sandy loam soil. In the third experiment (15 days incubation), it was found that P availability significantly decreased one day after P addition which was followed by a further decrease to day 5, but then remained unchanged until day 15. It can be concluded that P availability is reduced in presence of clay, and decreases with increasing concentration of salts, particularly Ca2+, and that the availability of P stabilizes in sandy and sandy loam soils within 2 weeks after addition of P from inorganic source. Increasing N or P fertilization enhanced wheat growth in salt affected soils. Therefore combined application of N and P may enhance wheat growth in saline-non sodic soils with neutral pH. Three glasshouse experiments were carried out with the aim to determine the salinity range to be used in the subsequent experiments and to test the hypothesis that combined addition of N and P fertilizers can enhance wheat growth in a sandy loam soil with low SAR and neutral pH. The first two experiments were conducted in a sandy loam salinized to EC1:5 of 0.18, 1.36, 2.00 and 2.67 dS m-1 using NaCl and CaCl2. The wheat varieties Janz and Krichauff died in all soils to which salt was added showing that these EC levels were too high. The third experiment was conducted with Krichauff in the sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.19, 0.32, 0.49, 0.67 and 0.86 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 2.2, 4.4, 6.7, 9.2 and 11.8 dS m-1, respectively, and with 0, 30 and 60 mg P kg-1 soil and 50, 100 and 200 mg N kg-1 soil. Salinity reduced plant dry matter at all N and P application rates. Increasing N application rates decreased growth at low and high salinity, whereas increasing P addition improved growth at all salinity levels. The highest shoot and root dry weights were obtained with 50 mg N and 60 mg P kg-1 soil. Nitrogen and P fertilization did not increase wheat growth in soil with greater than EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 9.2 dS m-1. Plants are known to respond differently to N form. A glasshouse experiment was carried out to assess the effect of N form (NH4 +, NO3 - or NH4NO3) added at 50, 100 and 200 mg kg-1 soil, in addition to the control (no N), on nutrient composition and growth of Krichauff in a sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.21, 0.48 and 0.86 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 2.8, 6.6 and 11.8 dS m-1. Increasing soil salinity decreased shoot and root dry weights and shoot macro- and micronutrient concentrations with all forms of N. At every N addition rate and with increasing N addition from N50 to N200, compared to NH4 +, the salinity of soil solution was far higher with NO3 - and lowest with NH4NO3. Shoot and root dry weights were highest with addition of 50 mg NO3-N or 100 mg NH4-N or as NH4NO3 at all salinity treatments. Concentrations of shoot P, Fe, Mn and Zn concentrations were greater with NH4 + and NH4NO3 compared to NO3 -, but concentrations of shoot K and Ca were higher with NO3 - than with NH4 + nutrition at all salinity treatments. At a given N rate, shoot and root dry weights were greatest with NH4NO3 in the saline sandy loam soil with up to EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of plant residue addition on microbial activity and biomass, and N and P availability in salt affected soils. Although the same amounts of Na+ and Ca2+ salts, EC1:5 differed between tested soils due to differences between soils in clay content and water holding capacity. The first experiment aimed to assess the salinity range for microbial activity over 2 weeks in saline soils with different texture amended with glucose/nitrate (C/N ratio 16:1). The EC1:5 were 0.2, 1.26, 1.83, 2.28 and 2.99 dS m-1 in the silty loam, 0.16, 1.10, 1.98, 2.33 and 3.18 dS m-1 in the sand and 0.19, 0.82, 1.75, 2.03 and 2.79 dS m-1 in the sandy loam. Soil respiration significantly decreased with increasing salinity in the glucose/nitrate amended soils, but was not completely inhibited even at highest salinity treatment. Cumulative CO2-C increased over 2 weeks and was highest in the silty loam soil and decreased in the following order: silty loam soil &lt; sandy loam soil &lt; sandy soil. The second experiment was conducted to determine the effect of three different plant residues added at 2% (w/w) on microbial biomass and N and P availability over time (70 days) in saline sandy and sandy loam soils with low SAR and neutral pH. The EC1:5 was 0.21, 1.08, 1.90, 2.63 and 2.89 dS m-1 in the sand and 0.19, 0.87, 1.63, 2.32 and 2.49 dS m-1 in the sandy loam. Microbial biomass C, N and P decreased with increasing soil salinity and were highest on day 10. With residue addition, microbial biomass C and P were significantly higher in the sandy than in the sandy loam soil, whereas no significant differences were found between soils for microbial biomass P at all salinity treatments. Under all salinity treatments, compared to other residues, highest biomass N was found in canola-amended sandy loam and in lupin-amended sandy soils. With increasing soil salinity, highest microbial P was found in the sandy soil amended with lupin residue. Nitrogen availability was generally higher in the sandy soil than in the sandy loam soil, whereas the opposite was found for P availability. Compared to canola and lucerne, N and P availability were highest in lupin amended sandy and sandy loam soil. Two experiments were conducted to assess whether N addition (rate and form) can affect the microbial activity in presence of residues in a saline sandy loam soil. The first experiment aimed to evaluate the effect of N rate (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg N kg-1 soil) added as NO3 - on soil respiration over 2 weeks under non-saline conditions in presence of 2% lupin residues. The second was to determine the effect of N added at 50 mg N kg-1 soil as NH4 + or NO3 - and lupin residue added at 2 and 4% (w/w) on microbial activity and biomass and N and P availability over 45 days in a sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.21, 0.51 and 0.85 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 2.8, 7.0 and 11.7 dS m-1. Soil respiration and cumulative respiration were not significantly affected by N application rate over 2-week-incubation under non-saline conditions. Microbial biomass and N and P availability decreased with increasing salinity and were highest at 4% lupin residue. Soil respiration rate and cumulative CO2-C and microbial biomass C, N and P were greater with addition of 50 mg N kg-1 soil as NO3-N compared to NH4-N at every addition rate of lupin residues under saline conditions. Soil microbial biomass C, N and P were highest on day 15 and decreased over time, whereas N and P availability were lowest on day 15 and increased over time. Since addition of inorganic N and P fertilizers improved the growth of wheat (cv Krichauff) in the saline sandy loam soil at SAR 1 and neutral pH, two glasshouse experiments were conducted to determine the effects of plant residue addition on the nutrition of wheat. The first experiment was conducted under non-saline condition to determine the effect of lupin residue rate (2% and 4% w/w) on wheat growth. The second experiment was conducted under saline conditions to determine the effect of P added as lupin residue (2%) and/or KH2PO4 (0, 20 and 40 mg P kg-1 soil) with and without 50 mg N kg-1 soil added as (NH4)2.SO4 on microbial biomass, N and P availability, plant growth and nutrient composition in the saline sandy loam soil. The EC1:5 were 0.23, 0.35 and 0.51 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 3.1, 4.8 and 7.0 dS m-1, respectively. In the first experiment under non-saline conditions, shoot dry weight was lower with addition of 4% than with 2% lupin residue with and without inorganic N. In the second experiment under saline conditions, microbial biomass C and N increased with increasing application of inorganic P, but was not as much as in presence of lupin residues. In presence of lupin residue, wheat growth increased with increasing addition of inorganic P under saline conditions. Compared to the soil with P from inorganic fertilizer and residues, inorganic P increased shoot and root dry weights and shoot P, K, Mn and Zn concentrations, but not N concentration. Addition of 50 mg inorganic N in presence of lupin residues significantly increased N and P availability and microbial biomass, but had no significant effect on wheat growth in a saline sandy loam soil. The results showed that optimal application of N and P organic and inorganic fertilizers can improve N and P availability, microbial activity and wheat growth in salt affected soils. Highest wheat dry weight was achieved by application of 60 mg P kg-1 soil in a sandy loam soil with EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1, equivalent to ECe 9.2 dS m-1. Wheat growth was also improved with application of N-NH4 + or as NH4NO3 at 100 mg N kg-1 soil. These N and P fertilization rates can potentially enhance wheat growth in the sandy loam soil with up to EC1:5 0.67 dS m-1, but with SAR 1 at neutral pH. Plant residues increased microbial activity and N and P availability in the saline soils. In the soils used here, with residue addition wheat growth was P limited due to competition with microorganisms for available P. Therefore application of residues with inorganic P is necessary to satisfy wheat requirements of N and P in the saline sandy loam soil. In the saline sandy loam soil at SAR 1 and neutral pH, application of 2% lupin residues and 40 mg KH2PO4-P kg-1 soil achieved highest microbial biomass, nutrient availability and wheat growth. However, wheat growth with these rates is not as high as with inorganic P at similar rate due to micronutrient deficiency in the saline soil with lupin residues.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat Growth.

As a result of the introduction of the onshore refugee program, a two-tier resettlement assistance system has developed. This system differentiates between refugees who have been issued protection visas offshore and onshore, and provides considerably less resettlement assistance to onshore-visaed refugees with Temporary Protection Visa (TPVs). The exclusion of TPV holders from resettlement assistance programs and the temporary nature of the visa has prompted this comparative study of the resettlement experiences of two groups of recently arrived refugees. This thesis considers the experiences of recently arrived refugees within the economic, social, cultural and political spheres of resettlement, in order to develop a deeper understanding of the inter-related nature of the resettlement process and the impact of visa category on the integration of refugees in contemporary Australia. Kuhlman&#8217;s (1991) model of refugee resettlement, and definition of integration form the basis of the theoretical framework of the thesis. A multiple method approach has been applied to the study and data from the second cohort of the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA) was analysed to present a macro level understanding of the resettlement experiences of recent arrivals in Australia. In Adelaide, interviews with key informants and service providers were undertaken in conjunction with a series of in-depth interviews with 10 Sudanese offshore-visaed Humanitarian entrants and 9 Iraqi onshore-visaed refugees, to provide detailed descriptions of the resettlement experience. While the resettlement process is found to be difficult for all refugees, the TPV policy acts to compound the problems and disadvantages refugees face in resettlement. Under these circumstances it is found that TPV holders experience social exclusion during their early resettlement in Australia. The importance of host-related factors on the resettlement experience are therefore found to be extremely relevant in contemporary Australian refugee resettlement. Policies regarding visa conditions, and refugees&#8217; eligibility for resettlement assistance have a significant impact in all spheres of the resettlement process. These findings suggest that the influence of host society policies must be accorded more weight in theories of resettlement, given their ability to extensively influence the resettlement process. Further this thesis presents substantial evidence against the TPV policy and recommends that temporary protection in Australia be reviewed, in order to ensure the social inclusion and successful integration of future refugee arrivals.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">refugees; asylum seekers; resettlement; integration; social exclusion; migration</field><field name="subject">Refugees--Australia</field><field name="subject">Refugees--Government policy--Australia.</field><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration--Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimodality imaging in cardiovascular disease.</field><field name="creator">Teo, Karen S.L.</field><field name="description">The non-invasive cardiovascular imaging modalities, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and multi-detector computer tomography (MDCT) are playing an increasing role in both clinical and research settings. CMR is a unique imaging modality due to unsurpassed contrast between soft tissue structures that is non-invasive, does not use ionising radiation and is able to provide high-resolution information about cardiac anatomy, function, flow, perfusion, viability and metabolism. It has provided the gold standard in imaging in congenital heart disease. Recent advances in this technology have led to images of high spatial and temporal resolution that has made the characterisation of atheroma possible. While currently spatial resolution still limits its ability to characterise atheroma in native human coronary arteries in living patients, CMR imaging of the coronary arteries has future potential with further technological and sequence advances. MDCT has been used in clinical settings to measure of the amount of calcification in the coronary arteries with &#8220;coronary artery calcium scoring&#8221; of the coronary tree a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. MDCT has also become the gold standard for angiographic imaging in most arterial beds such as the carotid and peripheral vascular systems. In the coronary arteries in particular, there have been major advances in the accuracy of coronary MDCT angiography, particularly with regards to its negative predictive value, although excessive calcification and blooming artefacts still limit the diagnostic accuracy of the technique for assessing stenotic severity. In this thesis, our aims were to address some specific novel areas advancing the utility of these imaging modalities in two major areas of interest, namely congenital heart disease and atheroma imaging. Our first step was to validate the accuracy and reproducibility of CMR, the main imaging modality we utilised. To achieve this, we assessed MR imaging of cardiac volumes and function in a normal adult Australian population with a specific focus on the reproducibility of the technique. In confirming that this technique in our hands is both accurate and reproducible, we would then be in a position to be able to confidently use this technique in our future chapters. However, more than this, we sought to establish some normal ranges for left and right atrial and ventricular parameters in our local population. This would be crucial background information for us to be able to make comparisons with future studies in patients with congenital heart disease. Having established our technique and reference ranges, we would then explore the two specific issues in the ensuing two chapters using CMR in one area of congenital heart disease, atrial septal defect. Atrial septal defect is the most common congenital heart defect first diagnosed in adults. The traditional method of assessment of these patients and for suitability for ASD closure involves semiinvasive investigation with transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) for measurement of the defect size and atrial septal margins. MRI assessment of patients prior to percutaneous device closure compared to TOE assessment would provide information on the accuracy of TOE assessment and provide information of the utility of cardiac MRI as an alternative to TOE for the work-up of these patients prior to ASD closure. In our third original research chapter, we utilised CMR to understand the effects of percutaneous ASD closure on cardiac chamber volumes. We achieved this by assessing with cardiac MRI pre-closure and post-closure atrial and ventricular cardiac volumes. Longstanding right heart dilatation in the setting of an ASD may lead to complications including right heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and arrhythmia. Closure of the ASD should reduce right heart volumes by removing left-to-right shunting and lead to normalisation of ventricular volumes. The assessment of atrial volume changes with ASD closure may be important in furthering our understanding in its contribution to arrhythmia. Having assessed the ability of CMR to assess both the ASD dimensions, and therefore suitability for percutaneous closure, as well as the effects of ASD closure on cardiac chamber size, we look in the final two original research chapters to move to another area of research development with these highresolution imaging technologies, atherosclerosis imaging. Two particular areas we wished to focus on included the potential of high-resolution MR imaging to monitor effects of HDL infusion on atherosclerosis, and secondly to explore mechanisms behind limitations in MDCT imaging of atherosclerosis, specifically calcification and blooming artifacts. For assessing the effects of HDL infusion on atherosclerosis, we utilised a cholesterol-fed rabbit model of atherosclerosis. The abdominal aorta of the rabbit is comparable in size to the human coronary artery. Previous work with the rabbit model of atherosclerosis and magnetic resonance imaging of the aortic wall has shown that it can provide information about atherosclerotic composition as well as provide serial data of the arterial wall. While high intensity lipid-lowering with statins remains the first line management of at risk individuals, modest manipulations of serum HDL levels are associated with a significant impact on cardiovascular risk. Thus, we assessed the effect of HDL infusion and atorvastatin in a rabbit model of using MRI aortic atherosclerosis as the endpoint. In our fifth and final original research chapter, we assessed the accuracy of quantification of atherosclerotic calcification with MDCT in the carotid arteries of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, and sought to identify algorithms or techniques that may improve quantification of calcification. This would potentially lead to an improvement in the ability of MDCT techniques to quantify stenotic severity in coronary arteries that were calcified. To achieve these we utilised MDCT in vivo and in comparison with carotid endarterectomy specimen micro-CT. Importantly, as part of this study, we undertook a thorough assessment of reproducibility of these techniques. Thus, in summary, we have been able to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of CMR and MDCT in the areas of a specific congenital defect (ASD) and atherosclerosis imaging, and utilised these techniques to advance our understanding of these disease states. This thesis identifies strengths and weaknesses of these techniques that will allow us to more appropriately use them for future purposes in cardiovascular disease. Future work directly stemming from this thesis has already begun, and now looks to address issues of whether CMR and MDCT may provide complimentary information about atherosclerotic lesions that may benefit outcomes in certain conditions. Specifically the work in this thesis has led to studies commencing in carotid atherosclerosis and saphenous vein graft atherosclerosis and using these imaging techniques to potentially predict adverse future outcomes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cardiovascular imaging; magnetic resonance imaging; computed tomography; atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis -- Imaging.</field><field name="subject">Heart -- Imaging.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Magnetic resonance imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Safety and efficacy of high dose docosahexaenoic acid for the preterm infant.</field><field name="creator">Smithers, Lisa Gaye</field><field name="description">There has been substantial research demonstrating improvements in visual and cognitive performance of preterm infants after feeding formulas containing n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA). The amount of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) estimated to be accrued by the fetus in the last trimester of gestation is greater than that supplied in current preterm formulas and breast milk of average DHA content (~0.3% of total fat in Western women). Yet many trials have compared infants fed formula containing concentrations near 0.3% DHA with infants fed formula containing no LCPUFA. No research has addressed whether the average breast milk DHA milk results in optimal development of preterm infants. The focus of this thesis was to compare the efficacy and safety of supplementing preterm infants with milk containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) at concentrations that meet the estimated in utero accretion rate (~1%) compared with current clinical practices (~0.3%). In a double-blind, randomised controlled trial (RCT), infants born &lt;33 weeks gestation were assigned to receive milk containing one of two doses of DHA. Treatment group infants received milk containing high dose DHA (1%) and infants in the control group infants received milk containing standard levels DHA (0.2 - 0.35%). Lactating mothers consumed capsules containing either tuna oil (900mg DHA) or soy oil (no DHA) that resulted in breast milk with either a high or typical concentration of DHA. Standard preterm formula milk with a corresponding DHA composition was fed to infants if formula feeds were required. The intervention period was from five days of commencing enteral feeds through to the infants estimated due date (EDD). Primary efficacy assessment was sweep visual evoked potential (VEP) acuity at 4 months corrected age (CA). Secondary efficacy outcomes included VEP acuity at 2 months CA and VEP latency at 2 and 4 months CA. Infant anthropometry was assessed regularly throughout the trial and the primary safety outcome was weight at 4 months CA. Other clinical safety data including incidence and severity of diseases commonly associated with prematurity were also assessed. The success of the intervention was demonstrated with infants in the treatment group having a significantly higher level of erythrocyte membrane DHA at EDD compared with the control group (% total erythrocyte phospholipids (mean &#177; SD), treatment group 6.8 &#177;1.2, control group 5.2 &#177; 0.7, p&lt;0.0005). The primary efficacy outcome of acuity at 4 months CA was significantly higher in the treatment compared with the control group infants (mean &#177; SD acuity (in cpd) treatment group 9.6 &#177; 3.7, control group 8.2 &#177; 1.8, p = 0.025). No significant differences were found in acuity at 2 months CA or latency at 2 or 4 months CA between infants in the control and treatment groups. No significant differences in weight, length or head circumference were found between treatment compared with control infants at EDD or at 4 months CA. Nor were any differences found in other clinical outcomes commonly associated with prematurity including, tolerance, necrotising enterocolitis, sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia or intraventricular haemorrhage. Increasing milk DHA to 1% of total fat suggests that the DHA requirement of preterm infants may be higher than the level available in preterm formula or breast milk of Australian women. Addressing both breast and formula milks demonstrates wide generalisability of these findings to common feeding practices in neonatal nurseries. Further studies are needed to determine whether this feeding strategy and dose of DHA is capable of improving other aspects of infant development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identifying target proteins of the CreB deubiquitination enzyme in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans.</field><field name="creator">Kamlangdee, Niyom</field><field name="description">Carbon catabolite repression in A. nidulans is a regulatory system which allows the organism to utilize the most preferable carbon source by repressing the expression of genes encoding enzymes utilizing alternative carbon sources. A ubiquitination pathway was shown to be one of the key mechanisms which regulate carbon source utilization, when creB was found to encode a deubiquitinating enzyme. Strains containing mutations in creB show loss of repression for some metabolic pathways in carbon catabolite repressing conditions, and also grow very poorly on several sole carbon sources such as quinate and proline, suggesting CreB plays multiple roles in the cell. This work describes the analysis of the interaction of CreB with CreA, and with PrnB and QutD. Various epitope-tagged versions of CreA were expressed in A. nidulans, and an internally located HA-epitope tag was found to allow detection of CreA using Western analysis. A diploid strain was constructed between strains containing HA-tagged CreA and FLAG-tagged CreB. When CreB was immunoprecipitated, HA-tagged CreA was also precipitated in the diploid, indicating that CreA and CreB are present in a complex in vivo. To determine whether CreA is a ubiquitinated protein, a version of CreA that was tagged with both an HA epitope and a His-tag was expressed in A. nidulans, and protein extracts were precipitated with an UbiQapture&#8482;-Q matrix. Western analysis was used to show that CreA was present in the precipitate. These findings suggest that CreA is a ubiquitinated protein, and a target of the CreB deubiquitination enzyme. To determine whether the proline permease (PrnB) is a direct substrate of CreB, plasmids to express epitope-tagged versions of PrnB were constructed and introduced into the prnB mutant strain. No tagged protein could be detected by Western analysis, even when these constructs were over-expressed from the gpdA promoter. However, a construct to express an HA epitope tagged version of quinate permease (QutD) fully complemented the qutD mutant strain, and HA-tagged QutD could be easily detected in Western analysis when probed with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. A diploid strain was made between a complementing transformant and a strain expressing a FLAG-tagged CreB construct. When QutDHA was immunoprecipitated, CreBFLAG was detected in the immunoprecipitate of the diploid. A proportion of QutDHA was also co-precipitated in the diploid when CreBFLAG was immunoprecipitated. Thus, CreB is present in a complex with QutD in vivo. Further results showed that the concentration of QutD in the cell is lower in a creB null mutant background than in the wild-type background, indicating that deubiquitination is required to prevent protein turnover. Northern analysis of mRNA showed that the failure of creB mutant strains to grow on quinate medium was not due to a failure of transcriptional induction of qutD, as the amount of mRNA was not lower in a creB1937 mutant background compared to the wild-type. Furthermore, experiments were undertaken that showed that QutD is a ubiquitinated protein. These findings suggest that quinate permease is regulated through deubiquitination involving the CreB deubiquitination protein in A. nidulans. In addition to the candidate protein approach asking whether CreA is a substrate of CreB, a proteomics approach was also used to identify proteins that interact with CreA. However, no clear interacting proteins were identified using this approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ubiquitination; CreA; CreB; CreC; carbon catabolite repression; permease; PrnB; QutD</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus nidulans Molecular genetics.</field><field name="subject">Fungi Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49025</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FG Fantin: the life &amp; times of an Italo-Australian anarchist 1901-42.</field><field name="creator">Faber, David</field><field name="description">This thesis is inspired by the historical principles of RG Collingwood, an historiographer whose precepts are recurrently cited herein. It is the life and times style biography of Francesco Giovanni Fantin, born San Vito de Leguzzano in the Schio district of the Province of Vicenza in the Veneto region of Italy 20 January 1901, died Loveday Internment Camp Compound 14A, South Australia 16 November 1942. SA police at the time found that Fantin was assassinated by fascist conspirators who contrived to intimidate witnesses and interfere with material evidence, (findings here confirmed) frustrating the laying of a charge of murder and leading in March 1943 to the sentencing of Giovanni Casotti to two years hard labour for manslaughter in the Supreme Court of South Australia. (Casotti was subsequently deported.) This thesis begins with the reconstruction of Fantin&#8217;s origins in one of the rural crucibles of Italian capitalism and industrialism. The presence of anarchist traditions in the Province and in Fantin&#8217;s immediate circle in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is documented. The history of the Great War, the Red Biennium and the Rise of Fascism in the Schio district is then reconstructed in connection with Fantin&#8217;s formative years, with particular reference to the role of the textile strike of 1921 as the precursor to the political and mass emigration from the district to Australia of which Fantin was a humble protagonist. Fantin&#8217;s years as an antifascist activist in exile in Australia are then rehearsed as an essential prerequisite for understanding why he was selected for assassination. The thesis closes with a detailed reconstruction of how his death was encompassed and its political implications managed by Dr HV Evatt.

Although a single motor module fault tolerant drive may be sufficient in some applications, this motor drive only offers limited redundancy. This thesis investigated the dual motor module fault tolerant drive system in which two motor modules were connected electrically in phase and on a common shaft provide redundancy and to increase the reliability of the entire drive system. A general phase current mathematical model to produce the desired output torque was developed to minimize copper loss and torque ripple in the motor drive, which is applicable to both sinusoidal and trapezoidal brushless permanent magnet motor types. A detailed fault effect investigation was performed in this thesis and it is concluded that switch short-circuit fault is the most serious fault since it reduces the electromagnetic torque output significantly and generates larger torque ripple in the motor drive due to the presence of large drag torque. Three fault remedial strategies were proposed to compensate the torque loss and to reduce the torque ripple under different faulty conditions. It is concluded from the analytical results that fault remedial strategy 3 is the tradeoff algorithm in which the zero torque ripple factor can be achieved with only a modest increase in copper loss comparing with the minimum possible value. Two practical dual motor module fault tolerant brushless permanent magnet drive test arrangements with different motor structures were developed in this thesis. The computer simulation studies using the MATLAB Simulink were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault remedial strategies. The efficiency of the motor drive was predicted based on torque loss measurements and the results were verified in the simulation study. The effect of faults on the drive efficiency was investigated as well. The entire fault tolerant motor drive control system was also developed to verify the analytical and simulation results. A fault detection and identification method to detect switch open-circuit faults, switch short-circuit faults, and the winding short-circuit faults was also proposed. Its advantages are the simplicity of the implementation and reduction of the cost of the drive system. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed fault remedial strategies can be implemented in real time motor control and are effective to compensate the torque loss and reduce the torque ripple.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motor drive; fault; permanent magnet; redundancy</field><field name="subject">Motors--Models.</field><field name="subject">Permanent magnets.</field><field name="subject">Redundancy (Engineering)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quadrals and their associated subspaces.</field><field name="creator">Butler, David Keith</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns sets of points in the finite projective space PG(n,q) that are combinatorially identical to quadrics. A quadric is the set of points of PG(n,q) whose coordinates satisfy a quadradic equation, and the term quadral is used in this thesis to mean a set of points with all the combinatorial properties of a quadric. Most of the thesis concerns the characterisation of certain sets of subspaces associated with quadrals. Characterisations are proved for the external lines of an oval cone in PG(3,q), of a non-singular quadric in PG(4,q), q even, and of a large class of cones in PG(n,q), q even.

Knockdown of FAM protein levels in mouse pre-implantation embryos by antisense oligonucleotides is known to prevent embryos from progressing to the blastocyst stage indicating an important role for FAM in early mammalian development. In mammals, the Fam gene is located on the X-chromosome. In mice, the Y homologue, Dffry or usp9y, is expressed exclusively in the testes and maps to the Sxrb deletion (Brown et al., 1998). Sxrb is associated with an early post-natal blockage of spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation leading to absence of germ cells (Bishop et al., 1988; Mardon et al., 1989). The human Y homologue of Fam is closely associated with oligozoospermia (Sargent et al., 1999; Sun et al., 1999) and the human X homologue has been linked to the failure of oocytes to pass through the first meitoc prophase in Turner syndrome (Cockwell et al., 1991; Speed, 1986) Despite these associations, the substrates and precise role of Fam and its homologues in these processes have not yet been defined. Due to the complex nature of Fam expression and the lack of data tying FAM to specific cellular functions, much attention has been paid in identifying interacting partners and cellular targets of FAM activity to aid in the definition of its role in the cell and development. Three common molecular biology techniques were applied here in an attempt to further characterise known interactions of FAM, including interactions with the cell adhesion molecule &#946;-catenin and the protein trafficking pathway proteins epsin-1 and itch. The aim of these investigations was to generate FAM mutants that could abolish individual interactions, enabling investigation of individual interactions in cellular function and development. These experiments failed to identify the amino acids of FAM that were critical for its interactions with &#946;-catenin, epsin-1, or itch. Experiments aimed at characterising a novel ubiquitin-like domain located in the N-terminal half of the FAM protein, did however identify novel interactions of FAM with the three Golgi associated adaptor proteins GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3. Further investigations prompted by this interaction, examined the role of FAM in the trafficking of proteins from the Golgi apparatus. Cellular FAM protein levels were altered either by exogenous expression of FAM protein or knockdown of endogenous FAM using FAM specific shRNA triggers. The cellular protein levels and extent of post-translational modification of eleven lysosomal proteins were monitored in each case. It was found that increased FAM protein levels resulted in decreased cellular protein levels of five of the eleven lysosomal proteins studied. In contrast, a reduction in FAM protein levels was found to result in an increase in the cellular protein levels of eight of the eleven lysosomal proteins. This study provides the first evidence of a deubiquitylating enzyme that is able to interact with the GGA proteins. It is also the first to describe a deubiquitylating enzyme that can affect the biosynthesis of lysosomal proteins and provides valuable new insight into the cellular function of FAM/USP9X.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deubiquitylation; protein trafficking; lysomal hydrolase</field><field name="subject">Lysosomes.</field><field name="subject">Proteins.</field><field name="subject">Enzymes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Snap shot: a novel with accompanying exegesis Snap shot: September 11, 2001, engaging with the ongoing narrative of fear.</field><field name="creator">Bone, Ian</field><field name="description">'Snap Shot' is a Young Adult novel centred around two main characters &#8211; 16 year-old Bel and her older step-sister, Diane, who was living in New York on September 11, 2001. The novel begins with a bus crash on a city freeway, and the narrator, who we later learn is Bel, unfolds the story that leads up to the crash. There are many plotlines that run through the novel, narrated in a variety of voices by Bel. She tells the story of her step-sister, who witnessed the September 11 attack from a distance (in Queens). She reveals her sister's story in the weeks following the attack. Diane is inspired by the image of one of the victims of the attack, a woman named Sena. She sees her photo in one of the desperate fliers that popped up around the city after the attack, and recognises a bracelet the woman is wearing as similar to one owned by her mother. Diane acts on an impulsive idea to somehow bring redemption to the family of this woman by creating a false photograph of the bracelet at Ground Zero, but she is detained by the National Guard. This is an incident that leads to her mother's decision to return to Australia to live. Back in Australia, Diane makes contact with her father, who is distant and dishonest with her. Diane asks to see her younger step-sister, Bel, but she is met with strong resistance. It is obvious that she is being kept from her sister. Bel also learns that her step-sister is back, but her attempts to make contact are blocked by her parents. Eventually the two sisters get together, and the younger forms a fascination and powerful admiration for her older sister, who is now a photographer. She takes images of men she has never met and posts them on her website with emotive labels such as 'victim' or 'terrorist'. Bel's fascination with her older sister leads her to want to emulate her. She sets out to take a photograph of a stranger, and stalks a young man for two days, working up the courage to approach him and interact with him. The fact that she wants to interact with her subject creates tension with her sister, who never speaks with her subjects. They argue about Bel's safety and Diane's courage. Bel eventually approaches the young man, Robert, and forms a connection with him. The coming together of these three characters sets in motion an idea, impulsive and provocative, driven by Bel, to create an artificial moment of terror on a bus as a means to shock the passengers and shake them from a 'dream'. This story is told through counter-voices that offer harmony and dissonance, and at times perspective, to the unfolding plotline. There is Shahrazade, an evocation of Bel's imagination, who is the ultimate in the courageous storyteller. Shahrazade uses narrative to divert her audience away from murderous revenge and into empathic connection. There are the short passages depicting the moments in the bus from the points of view of several passengers. There are the chapters where Bel is interrogated by two police officers, who slowly slide from being realistic characters to figments of Bel's overactive imagination. At the beginning of the novel, Bel tells the reader, 'You are witness to a tragedy, but you don&#8217;t call it that.' (Bone 2008) By the end, the verdict is left open. Are the three guilty of creating terror on the bus? Was it a tragedy? Is there redemption in the act of telling a story? The exegetical component of this thesis explores the social, literary and political context of the writing of 'Snap Shot'. It is in three parts, predicated on my research enquiry about the nature of the world we now live in post-September 11, a day that was supposed to have changed history. I explore whether there is a consistent and unified narrative that, as members of the public, we are engaging with. I look at the use of fear by the terrorists, and explore how this fear has manifested itself post-September 11. I ask whether there is an ongoing narrative of fear, and if so, what is its nature? How is it perpetuated? How does the public engage with this narrative? And what implications does this have for the writing of 'Snap Shot'? I explore literary and artistic responses to September 11, and explore the role of the artist as provocateur. What are the taboos and sore points that provocative art can touch on when looking at the subject of the world that has emerged post-September 11? The exegesis also explores how fear and terror are communicated, with a particular reference to symbolism and frames. What imaginings emerged from the subterranean consciousness prior to September 11, and what imaginings are at play today? Significantly, I explore what implications this imagination has for communicating an anti-terrorism message within the context of writing 'Snap Shot'.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative writing; fiction; young adult; terrorism; September 11; World Trade Centre attack; photography; fear; post-9-11 politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monogeneans of the Southern Fiddler Ray, Trygonorrhina Fasciata (Rhinobatidae) in South Australia: an exceptional model to compare parasite life history traits, invasion strategies and host specificity.</field><field name="creator">Glennon, Vanessa</field><field name="description">Trygonorrhina fasciata (Rhinobatidae) specimens naturally infected by three monogenean species were captured and maintained in marine aquaria to promote a continuous parasite load. Monogenean eggs recovered from aquaria provided larvae for descriptions and life history experiments. I describe the adult, larva and post-larval development of a new species of hexabothriid, Branchotenthes octohamatus, from the gills. This is the first monogenean larva described with only eight hooklets. This character may be useful to help resolve problematic relationships within the Hexabothriidae and offers insight into more general hypotheses about relationships within the Monogenea. I also redescribe the adult of Calicotyle australis (Monocotylidae) from the cloaca and describe the larva. The number and arrangement of larval ciliated epidermal cells and sensilla was revealed using silver nitrate. I redescribe Pseudoleptobothrium aptychotremae (Microbothriidae) adults from the skin of T. fasciata, representing a new host and locality record. Larval anatomy and post-larval development are also documented. The presence of six needle-like spicules in the larval haptor is confirmed, supporting an earlier theory that spicules are ancestral vestiges. My studies revealed three different egg hatching, host finding strategies and larval &#8216;types&#8217;. Branchotenthes octohamatus has a &#8216;sit-and-wait&#8217; strategy, entirely dependent on mechanical disturbance to stimulate eggs to hatch. Larvae are unciliated, cannot swim, lack pigmented eyespots and show no photo-response but may survive for more than two days after hatching at 22&#186;C. In contrast, eggs of C. australis hatch spontaneously with a strong diurnal rhythm in the first few hours of daylight when exposed to a LD12:12 illumination regime. Larvae are ciliated and can swim, have pigmented eyespots, are photo-positive and can remain active and survive for up to 24 h after hatching at 22&#186;C. Eggs of P. aptychotremae may have a &#8216;bet-hedging&#8217; strategy. Some eggs hatch spontaneously and rhythmically in an LD12:12 regime during the last few hours of daylight but their low hatching success rate suggests that other eggs may require a different cue provided by the host. Larvae are ciliated, can swim, lack pigmented eyespots, show no photo-response and remain active for only a few hours at 22&#186;C. Experiments using the fluorescent dye, 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate N-succinimidyl ester (CFSE) revealed B. octohamatus on gills of T. fasciata within 30 min of exposure to the host. This provides strong evidence that larvae invade the gills directly via the host&#8217;s inhalant respiratory current and do not migrate after initial attachment elsewhere. Five rhinobatid species (Aptychotrema vincentiana, T. fasciata, Trygonorrhina sp. A, A. rostrata and Rhinobatos typus), with overlapping distributions spanning west, south and east Australian coastal waters were surveyed for monogeneans at four locations between Fremantle, Western Australia and Stradbroke Island, Queensland. Genetic homogeneity, using the mitochrondrial gene Cytochrome b (cytb) and the nuclear marker, Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1a), was observed for all Branchotenthes and Calicotyle specimens irrespective of collection locality or rhinobatid species. Genetic homogeneity was observed for Pseudoleptobothrium specimens collected in western and southern Australia. However, local genetic heterogeneity was apparent among Pseudoleptobothrium specimens collected from two sympatric host species in New South Wales. Analyses revealed a highly divergent clade, indicating a morphologically cryptic, ancestral species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monogenea; Rhinobatidae; Trygonorrhina fasciata; marine; ectoparasite; hexabothriid; monocotylid; microbothriid; life histories; host specificity; hatching strategies; infection biology</field><field name="subject">Rays (Fishes) -- Parasites.</field><field name="subject">Rays (Fishes) -- Parasites -- Identification.</field><field name="subject">Rays (Fishes) -- Parasites -- Life cycles.</field><field name="subject">Ectoparasitic infestations.</field><field name="subject">Infection.</field><field name="subject">Host-parasite relationships.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49221</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biopsychosocial associates of infertility related distress and treatment outcomes.</field><field name="creator">Mahajan, Neha Naresh</field><field name="description">The experience of difficulties in conception, the diagnosis of infertility and its treatment are frequently associated with anxiety and overall distress. However, current understanding regarding the determinants of variability in the levels of distress among women undergoing infertility treatment is limited; and the evidence of the significance of distress as a risk factor for assisted conception following IVF/ICSI is inconsistent. The thesis addressed both these issues. Overall the thesis is informed by the biopsychosocial model of health and illness. Four studies were conducted. The data was collected in three IVF clinics in India. A consecutive sample of 85 infertile women about to commence IVF/ICSI cycle was recruited in the project at cycle baseline and followed through one treatment cycle. The first two studies examined this sample of women at baseline to identify the biopsychosocial factors associated with infertility related distress. The first study examined the degree of cognitive&#8211;behavioural adjustment to infertility, its treatment and treatment related eventualities, while the second study focused on the factors associated with affective aspects of infertility related distress such as increase in negativity and decrease in positivity. The third study examined the pattern of change in stress operationalized in terms of changes in Affect and State Anxiety in a sample of 74 infertile women during an IVF/ICSI cycle. The final study developed a prognostic model for evaluating the unique contribution of baseline distress as well as treatment related stress in estimating the odds of pregnancy following IVF based on a consecutive sample of 73 women. Collectively, the first two studies indicate that at the outset of the IVF/ICSI cycle, some women are more prone to distress than others, and that this variability is associated with their intrapersonal, interpersonal and sociodemographic attributes. These two studies have identified a set of protective and vulnerability factors related to cognitive-behavioural and affective aspects of distress. The last two studies clearly indicate that the level of distress tends to rise during the treatment among the majority of infertile women. The rising trend continued to be significant even after controlling for variables known to somewhat influence infertility related distress such as age, education, occupation, employment, financial burden and etiological factors. Further, a prognostic model is developed that proposes that both baseline level of stress and treatment stress make a unique contribution in defining the odds of pregnancy outcome for the patients. In short the thesis clearly brings out the case for integrating psychosocial care with the routine medical interventions for infertility.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">stress; infertility; treatment stress; biopsychosocial psychological; India</field><field name="subject">Infertility Psychological aspects</field><field name="subject">Human reproductive technology Psychological aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49223</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the born global : understanding the internationalisation process of biotechnology ventures.</field><field name="creator">Hewerdine, Lisa Jane</field><field name="description">The past decade has seen a surge of interest in &#8216;born global&#8217; firms which internationalise rapidly following their inception. While born global internationalisation paths are commonly associated with high tech firms, there has been some limited research suggesting that biotech ventures do not fit this model. My aim, therefore, was to contribute to international business research by investigating whether biotech firms internationalise as is suggested by born global scholars. Accordingly, my research focused on examining how the internationalisation of these small firms with radical innovations might best be explained. My research proceeded by means of a comparative case study of four Australian biotech companies, with their internationalisation histories forming the focal unit of analysis. The first contribution resulting from my cross-case analysis is to show that oversimplified measures of firm inception have led to &#8216;conceptual stretching&#8217; of the born global category. This does not imply that born globals do not exist; rather; I argue that greater care needs to be applied when measuring inception. Ultimately, biotech firms do not fit easily into the born global category because the lengthy innovation process they undergo means they are likely to have strong pre-organisational roots extending far beyond their incorporation date. This pre-organisational history needs to be factored in because of its effects on firm internationalisation. My second contribution is to suggest a driver for internationalisation that to date has not been included in existing research into high tech firms: namely, the influence of the innovation process. The internationalisation decisions of the case firms could be explained to a large extent by the stage that their core technologies were at. The international partnerships that the firms signed were also very much affected by the uncertainties surrounding the intellectual property being exchanged. My contribution therefore lies in proposing that incorporating the innovation process can advance understanding of high tech internationalisation. I conclude by suggesting that theory development concerning high tech internationalisation should pursue further these linkages between innovation and internationalisation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">born global; biotechnology; international entrepreneurship</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for the synthesis of diynyl, diyndiyl and bis(diyndiyl) ruthenium (II) complexes.</field><field name="creator">Scoleri, Nancy</field><field name="description">Chapter One outlines the different methods described in the literature for the synthesis of diynyl, symmetric and asymmetric diyndiyl complexes. The extension to complexes containing a central bridging group within the carbon chain is also introduced with the description of two different linking groups, either an organic or organometallic moiety. A brief overview of molecular electronics and one method of evaluation of electronic communication, cyclic voltammetry, are also addressed. Chapter Two describes the synthesis of novel symmetric and asymmetric bis(diyndiyl) ruthenium(II) complexes of general formula {LnM}-C&#8801;CC&#8801;C-{M&#8221;L&#8221;p}- C&#8801;CC&#8801;C-{M&#8217;L&#8217;m}, featuring two transition metal fragments linked by either a Ru(dppe)2 moiety or a trinuclear copper(I) or silver(I) cluster M3(&#956;-dppm)3 (M = Cu, Ag). Through the use of cyclic voltammetry, it was shown that the inclusion of these three particular bridging groups allows electronic communication between the two terminal end-groups. The chemistry of the starting material trans-Ru(C4H)2(dppe)2 (1) is also described, forming novel complexes when reacted with AuCl(PPh3) or TCNE. Chapter Three describes a new convenient synthetic route to diynyl and diyndiyl ruthenium(II) complexes. Lithiation of the ruthenium(II) diynyl complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CH)(dppe)Cp* and Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CH)(PPh3)2Cp with n-BuLi yields the lithium complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CLi)(dppe)Cp* and Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CLi)(PPh3)2Cp. The most favorable conditions for their formation are examined by using NMR spectroscopy and different assay reactions. These lithium species are further reacted with a range of metal halides to give new asymmetric diyndiyl complexes of general formula [Ru](C&#8801;CC&#8801;C){MLn} (where [Ru] = Ru(dppe)Cp*, Ru(PPh3)2Cp). Chapter Four investigates the reactivity of the novel lithium complex Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CLi)(dppe)Cp* synthesised in Chapter Three. The nucleophilic nature of this complex is assessed with a range of electrophiles such as organic substrates or polyfluoroaromatic compounds. A number of new complexes are prepared and singlecrystal X-ray structure determinations are reported for many of the complexes. The electrochemistry of some of these complexes is also described. Chapter Five summarises the reactions of diynyl ruthenium(II) complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CR)(dppe)Cp* (where R = H, TMS, Au(PPh3)) with three azide reagents TMSN3, TsN3 and AuN3(PPh3). The reactions are suggested to undergo a Huisgen 1,3-alkyne-azide cycloaddition to generate 1,2,3-triazoles which further react to give the various products. The complexes synthesised are characterised by spectroscopic methods and, where possible, by X-ray structure determination. Furthermore, the reactions of the complexes Ru(C&#8801;CC&#8801;CH)(PPh3)2Cp and Ru(C&#8801;CH)(dppe)Cp* with azides to give the ruthenium azido complexes [Ru]N3 (where [Ru] = Ru(PPh3)2Cp, Ru(dppe)Cp*) are described.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diynyl; diyndiyl; rutherium; organometallic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing the oral health of adults with physical and intellectual disabilities.</field><field name="creator">Pradhan, Archana</field><field name="description">Background: People with physical and intellectual disabilities have varying health needs and living arrangements. They depend on their carers for their daily oral hygiene care. Objectives: 1. To describe the dental practices and oral health among people aged 18&#8211;44 years with physical and intellectual disabilities and 2. To determine if residential setting is associated with care recipients&#8217; oral health status, or if there are other factors, which if modified, could improve the oral health of adults with physical and intellectual disabilities. Methods: Cross-sectional mailed questionnaire survey (February 2005 &#8211; June 2006) of carers of adults with physical and intellectual disabilities (18&#8211;44 years) living in South Australia in three settings: family home; community housing; and institutions, followed by oral examinations of care recipients by trained examiners at recalls or new appointments. Decayed (D), missing (M) and filled (F) teeth (DMFT), tooth wear, oral hygiene and gingival status were recorded. Results: Carers completed the questionnaire for 485 adults, a yield of 37.9%, of which 267 care recipients were examined (completion rate = 55.1%). Some 47.4% of the care recipients lived in family homes, 31.4% in community housing and 21.2% in institutions. Some 39.3% of care recipients had their teeth brushed once a day or less, with most needing assistance from their carers. Infrequent toothbrushing and inadequate time to clean were more frequently reported by carers at family homes than those at other settings (P&lt;0.001). Care recipients at institutions visited the dentist more frequently than those at other settings (P&lt;0.001). Other care recipients had problems accessing dental care due to their carers&#8217; lack of awareness of dental services available, lack of dentists with adequate skills in managing people with disabilities, cost, location of dental clinic, lack of dentists willing to treat people with disabilities and transportation problems. Some 18.8% of care recipients required a general anaesthetic and 13.1% an oral sedation for oral examination and treatment. Presence of both oral health problems and treatment needs were reported by almost 50% of carers, but only 13.5% of care recipients reportedly experienced one or more negative impacts. Oral examinations showed that the prevalence of untreated decay among the care recipients in South Australia was 16.9% (95% CI= 12.7, 21.7) and 76.3% (95% CI= 71.0, 81.2) had past and present caries experience. None of the examined subjects wore a removable prosthesis, although nearly 50% had one or more missing teeth. After adjusting for carer and care recipient characteristics, multivariate analysis showed that there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) in the prevalence of untreated decay (D&gt;0) missing teeth (M&gt;0), filled teeth (F&gt;0), caries experience (DMFT&gt;0) or mean DMFT among the three residential settings. However, untreated decay was significantly associated with moderate [OR= 3.7 (1.2, 11.4)] and high intake [OR= 3.3 (1.1, 11.1)] of sweet drinks and never visiting the dentist or visiting only because of a problem [OR= 5.2 (1.7, 15.8)]; missing teeth were significantly associated with requirement for a general anaesthetic for dental treatment [OR= 3.2 (1.4, 7.2)] and having low [OR= 3.4 (1.1, 10.3)] and high [OR= 4.2 (1.7, 10.7)] weekly hours of care; filled teeth were significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 5.4 (2.0, 14.9)], lack of oral hygiene assistance from carers [OR= 5.1 (2.2, 11.8)] and high weekly hours of care [OR= 4.4 (2.0, 9.5)]; and caries prevalence was significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 7.3 (2.0, 26.3)], lack of oral hygiene assistance from carers [OR= 4.0 (1.3, 12.5)] and high weekly hours of care [OR= 6.3 (2.5, 15.9)]. Mean DMFT was significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [&#946;= 3.0 (0.4, 5.6)], autism [&#946; = 3.4 (1.3, 5.8)], intellectual disability [&#946; = 2.5 (0.3, 4.8)], and high weekly hours of care [&#946; = 3.6 (1.6, 5.6)]. Anterior tooth wear was found in 45.1% (95% CI= 36.1, 53.9) and posterior tooth wear in 23.9% (95% CI= 18.7, 29.0) of care recipients. Care recipients in the community were more likely to have posterior tooth wear compared to those in family homes. Anterior tooth wear was significantly associated with 25&#8211;34 age-group [OR= 3.1 (1.5, 6.5)], 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 2.6 (1.1, 6.2)] and rumination [OR= 3.4 (1.3, 9.2)]. Oral hygiene and gingival status were poor with the prevalence of extensive plaque (dental plaque on all surfaces of the tooth, with a score of 2 or more) of 40.0% (95% CI= 34.1, 45.9), extensive calculus (moderate to abundant amount of supra and subgingival calculus, with a score of 2 or more) of 41.9% (95% CI= 36.0, 47.8), and extensive gingivitis (gingivitis extending all around the tooth, with a score of 2 or more) of 36.0% (95% CI= 30.2, 41.8). Residential setting was not associated with oral hygiene and gingival status. Extensive plaque was significantly associated with 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 3.9 (1.4, 11.2)], poor to fair general health [OR= 3.3 (1.2, 9.0)], habit of placing food/medicine/other products in mouth for lengthy periods of time [OR= 7.8 (2.7, 22.7)], care recipients cared for by male carers [OR= 3.9 (1.4, 10.8)], and care recipients with high weekly hours of care [OR= 4.0 (1.5, 10.8)]. Extensive calculus was significantly elevated in prevalence in the 25&#8211;34 age-group [OR= 4.3 (1.8, 10.7)], 35&#8211;44 age-group [OR= 5.3 (1.8, 15.4)]. Extensive gingivitis was significantly associated with always needing help for self-care activities from carers [OR= 3.5 (1.2, 10.2)]. Conclusions: Residential setting was not associated with caries experience, oral hygiene and gingival status among adults with disabilities, after adjustment for age and other relevant characteristics of care recipients. However, care recipients in the community were more likely to have posterior tooth wear compared to those in family homes. Emphasis should be placed on modifiable factors like carer assistance with daily oral hygiene care, diet and regular dental visits, whilst ensuring that carers are not overburdened.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">oral health; adults; disabilities</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding and dealing with evil and suffering: a fourth century A.D. pagan perspective.</field><field name="creator">Wallis, Susanne H.</field><field name="description">People of late antiquity were subjected to the universal and perennial human woes - injustice, affliction, adversity and pain - that cause suffering. The experience of suffering is subjective. There are however, common sources of and expressions of suffering in humans. The fourth century was a period of significant cultural and social changes which drew responses from pagans that not only reflected traditional knowledge but also engaged with new sets of ideas. This thesis examines the problem of evil and suffering as experienced by pagans of the fourth century of the Common Era. Having received imperial sanction from the emperor Constantine after his conversion in 312, Christianity was gaining momentum in both membership and strength. The Graeco-Roman world had become one where Christianity, it seemed to some, had effectively surpassed pagan state cult Against this backdrop of religious change, pagans had taken on a self-consciousness that engendered a rethinking of many traditional ways of coping with and explaining the evils of the world and the suffering that could result from them. Some rules and conditions had changed, so how and where could pagans seek explanation for, protection from or alleviation of their suffering? The study addresses this question by posing and responding to further questions. Firstly, how did pagans understand the presence of evil and suffering in the world? Secondly, from what sources, natural or supernatural, could they draw hope in the face of evil and suffering? And thirdly, what degree of autonomy could pagans claim in approaching the problem? Religion and philosophy might be perceived by pagans to contain the answers to why there was evil and suffering in the world. The addition of science and the occult to religion and philosophy offered further ways through which pagans might seek to deal with the problem. By drawing primarily on extant literary evidence from the period as well as selected material evidence (predominantly pagan, but including some Christian), the research will trace the evolution of ideas regarding evil and suffering that pagan thinkers were bringing to the contemporary debate.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pagan; evil; suffering; late antiquity</field><field name="subject">Good and evil History.</field><field name="subject">Suffering</field><field name="subject">Paganism History.</field><field name="subject">Christianity 4th century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8217;Indian architecture&#8217; and the production of a postcolonial discourse: a study of architecture + design (1984-1992).</field><field name="creator">Panicker, Shaji K.</field><field name="description">An unprecedented production of discourses on contemporary Indian architects and architecture occurred in the 1980s. Published in a period of political transition and conspicuous new cultural production and debate in many fields, four decades after India&#8217;s independence from colonial rule in 1947, these architectural discourses have become privileged references that have shaped but also limited perception of late-twentieth century architectural production in India. While subsequent writers have addressed some of these limitations, the small but growing critical literature in this field still exhibits many of the same problems of representation. Despite problematising the construction of &#8216;Indian architecture&#8217; in colonial and postcolonial discourse, these critiques have nevertheless taken for granted (as in the more popular and professionally oriented discourses of the 1980s) the existence of a pan-Indian community of architects, united in their search for a collective identity. Such monolithic perceptions of contemporary &#8216;Indian architecture&#8217; have yet to be interpreted with regard to the conspicuous contexts in which they were produced &#8212; that is, from an &#8216;Indian&#8217; point of view. Through a selective focus on a particularly productive site of discourse in 1980s India, I investigate complexities that have not yet been examined in the formation and reproduction of a dominant consensus on the identity of contemporary Indian architecture. The argument draws attention not only to the agency of particular contemporary Indian architects in the construction of this identity, but also the relativity of region in the architectural production of India during the 1980s. Specifically, I focus on an influential architectural magazine, Architecture + Design (A+D) that began publishing in 1984 from a dominant region of architectural production, Delhi. I provide an account of the manner in which history, context, agency and agents, came together at a point in time, within this architectural magazine, as a complex set of historically constituted social relations, to authorise and sustain particular viewpoints about contemporary Indian architecture. Using the French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s theory of the field of cultural production, I relate issues of dominance and marginalisation observable in the production of this particular discourse on contemporary Indian architecture to the space of the positions held by its producers. Despite its avowed agenda of viewing contemporary Indian architecture differently in the 1980s, I argue, the selection and judgement of exemplary contemporary work deemed worthy of discussion in A+D as &#8216;Indian Architecture&#8217; functioned (and continues to function) through established categories of perception and appreciation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indian architecture; postcolonial; discourse; Pierre Bourdieu; cultural production; representation; colonial discourse; sites of discourse</field><field name="subject">Indian architecture</field><field name="subject">Architecture India</field><field name="subject">Architecture India 20th century</field><field name="subject">Architects India</field><field name="subject">Architecture in literature</field><field name="subject">Postcolonialism India</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/49947</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regularized equivariant Euler classes and gamma functions.</field><field name="creator">Lu, Rongmin</field><field name="description">We consider the regularization of some equivariant Euler classes of certain infinite-dimensional vector bundles over a finite-dimensional manifold M using the framework of zeta-regularized products [35, 53, 59]. An example of such a regularization is the Atiyah&#8211;Witten regularization of the T-equivariant Euler class of the normal bundle v(TM) of M in the free loop space LM [2]. In this thesis, we propose a new regularization procedure &#8212; W-regularization &#8212; which can be shown to reduce to the Atiyah&#8211;Witten regularization when applied to the case of v(TM). This new regularization yields a new multiplicative genus (in the sense of Hirzebruch [26]) &#8212; the ^&#915;-genus &#8212; when applied to the more general case of a complex spin vector bundle of complex rank &#8805; 2 over M, as opposed to the case of the complexification of TM for the Atiyah&#8211;Witten regularization. Some of its properties are investigated and some tantalizing connections to other areas of mathematics are also discussed. We also consider the application of W-regularization to the regularization of T&#178;- equivariant Euler classes associated to the case of the double free loop space LLM. We find that the theory of zeta-regularized products, as set out by Jorgenson&#8211;Lang [35], Quine et al [53] and Voros [59], amongst others, provides a good framework for comparing the regularizations that have been considered so far. In particular, it reveals relations between some of the genera that appeared in elliptic cohomology, allowing us to clarify and prove an assertion of Liu [44] on the &#710;&#920;-genus, as well as to recover the Witten genus. The ^&#915;&#8322;-genus, a new genus generated by a function based on Barnes&#8217; double gamma function [5, 6], is also derived in a similar way to the ^&#915;-genus.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">loop spaces; characteristic classes; equivariant; cohomology; zeta-function; regularization; double gamma function; elliptic genera</field><field name="subject">Loop spaces.

In the lamb, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) results in a low birth weight and an increased visceral fat mass by 45d of postnatal life. In this thesis I have investigated the effect of IUGR on adipose tissue development and function during fetal and early postnatal life in the sheep. IUGR was induced by removal of the majority of endometrial caruncles in non pregnant ewes prior to mating which resulted in the subsequent placental restriction of fetal growth (PR). Fetal blood samples were collected from 116d gestation and visceral perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) collected from PR and control fetuses at 145d. In lambs IUGR was defined as a birth weight less than 2 standard deviations below the mean of a cohort of singleton Merino lambs. Blood samples were collected throughout the first 3 weeks of life and PAT and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was collected at 21 d. It was determined whether IUGR alters the expression of genes which regulate adipogenesis (IGF1, IGFR1, IGF2, IGFR2, PPARy, and RXR&#945;), adipocyte metabolism (LPL, G3PDH, GAPDH) and adipokine signalling (leptin, adiponectin) in adipose tissue depots before and after birth using qRT-PCR. PR fetuses were hypoglycaemic, hypoinsulinaemic, hypoxic, and had a lower body weight than Control fetuses. The expression of both IGF1 and leptin mRNA in PAT, the major fetal adipose depot, was lower in the PR fetuses, although there was no difference in the expression of other adipokine or adipogenic genes in PAT between PR and control fetuses. Thus restriction of placental and hence fetal substrate supply results in decreased IGF1 and leptin expression in fetal visceral adipose tissue which may alter the functional development of the perirenal fat depot and contribute to altered leptin signalling in the growth restricted newborn and the subsequent emergence of an increased visceral adiposity. At 21d of postnatal life there was no increase in the relative mass of perirenal or subcutaneous fat in IUGR lambs compared with controls. Thus, this study has investigated the effect of IUGR on the development of adipose tissue prior to the development of an obese phenotype. At 21d of life there was a sex specific effect of IUGR on the expression of PPARy and leptin mRNA in perirenal visceral fat such that PPARy and leptin mRNA expression was decreased in male IUGR lambs, but not females. Interestingly PAT mass was greater in females than males, independent of birth weight. Plasma insulin concentrations during the first 24h after birth predicted the size of the adipocytes and expression of adiponectin in visceral adipose tissue in both males and females at 21d. Thus, the nutritional environment before, and immediately after birth, may program adipocyte growth and gene expression in visceral adipose tissue. The differential effect of sex and birth weight on PPARy and leptin expression in visceral fat may be important in the subsequent development of visceral obesity and the insulin resistant phenotype in later life. At 21d of life there was no difference between Control and IUGR lambs in the relative mass of subcutaneous fat, or the expression of PPARy, RXR&#945;, leptin, adiponectin, LPL, G3PDH, and GAPDH in subcutaneous fat at 21d of life. We have shown that the growth of the subcutaneous fat depot is related to plasma glucose, insulin and leptin concentrations, and to the development of perirenal fat. Thus, in contrast to perirenal adipose tissue, the postnatal, but not the fetal nutritional environment, programs subcutaneous adipocyte growth and gene expression. This thesis speculates that there may be a factor secreted from visceral fat that influences the development of the subcutaneous fat depot. At 21d of life there was also an effect of sex, but not IUGR, on the expression of IGF mRNA in adipose tissue. Male lambs had a higher expression of IGF1 mRNA in both PAT and SAT, and a higher expression of IGF1R and IGF2R in SAT compared with female lambs. It is likely that these differences in IGF mRNA levels reflect sexual dimorphism of the GH-IGF axis. When male and female lambs were combined there was a higher expression of IGF1 mRNA in SAT compared with PAT, and a higher expression of IGF2, IGF1R and IGF2R mRNA in PAT compared with SAT. These differences in IGF mRNA expression provide a potential mechanism to explain the sex and depot specific variations in mitogenic potency of IGF1 and proliferative capacities of preadipocytes, the regional variation in adipocyte metabolism, and the difference in incidence of visceral obesity between men and women in adult life.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low birth weight; IVGR; obesity; insulin resistance; neonate; fetus</field><field name="subject">Adipose tissues.

These detectors use long-baseline Michelson interferometers, where the critical enabling component is the laser. The laser required for these interferometers must provide a low noise, single frequency, diffraction limited, high power TEM&#8320;&#8320; beam. Very importantly, the laser beam must be available continuously and without the need for operator intervention. In this thesis I describe the development and characterisation of injection-locked 10 W Nd:YAG lasers, designed specifically for use at the Australian Consortium for Interferometric Gravitational Astronomy (ACIGA) High Power Test Facility (HPTF) in Western Australia, and on the Japanese TAMA 300 gravitational wave interferometer (GWI). The starting point was a 5 W laboratory laser that had demonstrated the proof-of-principle; however this laser had insufficient power, inadequate reliability, and was not suitable for deployment to a remote site. I describe the development of this laser technology and design to realise reliable, longterm operation and field deployability, while satisfying the requirements for a GWI, with the final laser system bearing little resemblance to the proof-of-principle system. Injection-locked lasers were successfully installed at the ACIGA HPTF and at TAMA 300 in June 2004 and September 2005 respectively. The 10 W laser uses a Nd:YAG Coplanar Pumped Folded Slab (CPFS) gain medium. The slab is side-pumped using a temperature controlled, fast-axis collimated, custom laser diode array, and conduction cooled in the orthogonal direction. Interferometry is used to measure the thermal lensing within the gain medium; these measurements are used to design a single-mode, travelling-wave slave resonator. The entire slave laser is temperature controlled and mounted on an integrated, air-cooled base. The thermal design is validated by extensive thermal testing. Long-term and robust injection-locking is achieved by using a servo system based on the Pound-Drever-Hall technique. I describe the development of a split feedback servo system to provide increased frequency stabilisation loop bandwidth and show that long-term injection-locking of the slave laser to a low power non-planar ring oscillator (NPRO) master laser produces a single frequency output at ~ 10 W with M&#178;[subscript]x.y approx &#8804; 1.1. Finally, the noise of the injection-locked laser is characterised. Relative intensity noise measurements demonstrate stability comparable to current GWI laser sources, while the results of a heterodyne beat measurement show that the 10 W injectionlocked laser output has frequency noise limited by the NPRO input. The laser installed at the ACIGA HPTF has been used to investigate the effects of increased intracavity laser powers on next-generation interferometers, with the laser described in this thesis being the key enabling component of this research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lasers; gravitational waves; interferometry</field><field name="subject">Interferometry.</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves.</field><field name="subject">Gravitational waves -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Lasers.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Threshold photo-ionisation and density functional theory studies of metal-carbide clusters.</field><field name="creator">Dryza, Viktoras</field><field name="description">Neutral gas-phase metal-carbide clusters are generated by laser ablation and are detected in the constructed time-of-flight mass-spectrometer by laser ionisation. Photo-ionisation efficiency (PIE) experiments are performed on the metal-carbide clusters to determine their ionisation potentials (IPs). Complimentary density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on the energetically favorable structural isomers of the metalcarbide clusters. Comparison between the calculated IPs of the isomers and the experimental IP allows the carrier of the observed ionisation onset for a metal-carbide cluster to be assigned. The niobium-carbide clusters Nb&#8323;Cy (y = 0&#8211;4), Nb&#8324;Cy (y = 0&#8211;6) and Nb&#8325;Cy (y = 0&#8211;6) are examined by PIE experiments and DFT calculations. The IPs of the niobium-carbide clusters are found to be either left reasonably unchanged from the IPs of the bare metal clusters or moderately reduced. The clusters Nb&#8323;C&#8322;, Nb&#8324;C&#8324;, Nb&#8325;C&#8322; and Nb&#8325;C&#8323; display the largest IP reductions for their corresponding cluster series. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Nb&#8323;Cy (y = 1&#8211;3) clusters are based on the carbon atoms attaching to the niobium faces and/or niobium-niobium edges of the triangular Nb&#8323; cluster. However, for Nb&#8323;C&#8324; the ionisation onset is assigned to a low-lying isomer, which contains a molecular C&#8322; unit, rather than the lowest energy isomer, a niobium atom deficient 2&#215;2&#215;2 face-centred cubic (fcc) nanocrystal structure. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Nb&#8324;Cy (y = 1&#8211;4) clusters are based on the carbon atoms attaching in turn to the niobium faces of the tetrahedral Nb&#8324; cluster, developing a 2&#215;2&#215;2 fcc nanocrystal structure for Nb&#8324;C&#8324;. For Nb&#8324;C&#8323; two ionisation onsets are observed; one weak onset at low energy and another more intense onset at high energy. It is proposed that the two onsets are due to ionisation from both a metastable &#179;A&#8321; state and the ground &#185;A&#8321; state of the lowest energy isomer. The ionisation onsets of Nb&#8324;C&#8325; and Nb&#8324;C&#8326; are also proposed to originate from metastable triplet states of the lowest energy isomers, with the transitions from the ground singlet states calculated to be greater than the highest achievable photon energy in the laboratory. The structures of Nb&#8324;C&#8325; and Nb&#8324;C&#8326; have one and two carbon atoms in a 2&#215;2&#215;2 fcc nanocrystal substituted with molecular C&#8322; units, respectively. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Nb&#8325;Cy (y = 1&#8211;6) clusters are based on the underlying Nb&#8325; cluster being in either a &#8220;prolate&#8221; or &#8220;oblate&#8221; trigonal bipyramid geometry; the former has six niobium faces available for carbon addition, while the latter has two niobium butterfly motifs and two niobium faces available for carbon addition. Both the structures of Nb&#8325;C&#8325; and Nb&#8325;C&#8326; have the underlying Nb&#8325; cluster in the oblate trigonal bipyramid geometry and contain one and two molecular C&#8322; units, respectively. The tantalum-carbide clusters Ta&#8323;Cy (y = 0&#8211;3), Ta&#8324;Cy (y = 0&#8211;4) and Ta&#8325;Cy (y = 0&#8211;6) are examined by PIE experiments and DFT calculations. The IPs of the tantalum-carbide clusters in each series show trends that are very similar to the corresponding iso-valent niobium-carbide cluster series, although the IP reductions upon carbon addition are smaller for the former. For the vast majority of tantalum-carbide clusters, the same structural isomer is assigned to the ionisation onset as that assigned for the corresponding niobium-carbide cluster. Bimetallic tantalum-zirconium-carbide clusters are generated using a constructed double ablation cluster source. The Ta&#8323;ZrCy (y = 0&#8211;4) clusters are examined by PIE experiments and DFT calculations. The IP trend for the Ta&#8323;ZrCy cluster series is reasonably similar to that of the Ta&#8324;Cy cluster series, although the IP reductions upon carbon addition are greater for the former. The structures assigned to the IPs of the Ta&#8323;ZrCy (y = 1&#8211;4) clusters are based on the carbon atoms attaching in turn to the metal faces of the tetrahedral Ta&#8323;Zr cluster. In summary, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates that the structures of metalcarbide clusters can be inferred by the determination of their IPs through PIE experiments in combination with DFT calculations on candidate structural isomers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laser spectroscopy; ionization potential; metal cluster; DFT; nanocrystal; isomer; met-car</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gastro-duodenal motility &amp; nutrition in the critically ill.</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Marianne</field><field name="description">Inadequate delivery of nutrition to the critically ill is common, and may adversely affect clinical outcomes, including survival. This thesis reports studies designed to characterise the gastrointestinal dysfunction underlying feed intolerance in the critically ill, as well as the pathophysiology of these dysfunctions, and investigate potential therapeutic measures. While it has been established that enteral nutrition is frequently unsuccessful in the critically ill, assessment of the success of feeding in an Australian intensive care unit (ICU) had not been performed previously. A prospective survey examined the incidence of, and risk factors for, feed intolerance in the ICU at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and demonstrated that, in 40 patients receiving enteral feeding, only about 60% of their nutritional requirements were met at the end of the first week. The main cause for this lack of success was large gastric residual volumes, indicative of delayed gastric emptying (GE). This study, accordingly, quantified the limitations of nutritional delivery in contemporary practice in a local ICU. The results suggest that a better understanding of the pathogenesis underlying this problem is warranted in order to direct research into improved therapies. Scintigraphy is the most accurate technique to measure GE, but is difficult to perform in the ICU. A simpler, more convenient, test would increase the accessibility of GE measurement for both research and clinical purposes. A study comparing a breath test technique and gastric residual volume measurement to the scintigraphic measurement of GE in 25 mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated that GE measured by a breath test technique closely correlated with that measured by scintigraphy. While the breath test had a specificity of 100% it only had a sensitivity of about 60% in the prediction of delayed GE. Similarly, gastric residual volume measurement correlated with scintigraphic measurement of GE but also lacked sensitivity. The breath test has previously been demonstrated to be highly reproducible and it represents a useful option for repeated measurement of GE in the same patient. It is therefore likely to be useful to determine changes in GE over time or in response to a therapeutic intervention. There is a lack of information about the prevalence and determinants of delayed GE in the critically ill. Previous studies have substantial limitations and scintigraphic measurement of GE has only rarely been used. A study comparing GE measured by scintigraphy in 25 patients to 14 healthy subjects demonstrated that GE was delayed in approximately 50% of the ICU patients (&gt;10% retention at 4h) and markedly delayed in about 20% (&gt;50% retention at 4h). Patients with trauma and sepsis appeared to have a relatively higher prevalence of delayed GE (80% and 75% respectively). In addition, the longer the patient had been in ICU the more normal the rate of GE. Quantification of delayed GE may prove useful by defining patients who may benefit from preventative or therapeutic options. The abnormalities in gastrointestinal motility underlying delayed GE in the critically ill are poorly characterised. Simultaneous manometric and gastric emptying measurements were performed in 15 mechanically ventilated patients and 10 healthy subjects. These studies demonstrated that delayed GE was associated with reduced antral activity, increased pyloric activity and increased retrograde duodenal activity in the patients. Persistent fasting motility during feeding was also frequently observed. Furthermore, the feedback response to small intestinal nutrients was enhanced. This latter observation may provide an explanation for the delayed GE and warrants further investigation. Recent studies suggest that the hormone cholecystokinin may be a mediator of increased small intestinal feedback and, if confirmed, this has clear therapeutic implications. Nutrient absorption has rarely been measured in the critically ill. GE and glucose absorption (using 3-O-methyl glucose) were measured simultaneously in 19 ICU patients and compared to 19 healthy subjects. Glucose absorption was shown to be markedly reduced in the patients. Slow GE was associated with delayed, and reduced, absorption. However, glucose absorption was also reduced in patients with normal GE suggesting that reduced glucose absorption in critical illness is only partly due to delayed GE. Accordingly, measures to improve the effectiveness of GE and thereby improve overall nutritional status may be compromised by abnormal small intestinal absorption. The mechanisms underlying this warrant further investigation. A number of therapeutic options directed at improving the delivery of nutrition were examined. In a study involving 20 mechanically ventilated patients, administration of 200mg erythromycin intravenously was shown to be superior to placebo for treating feed intolerance. The optimal dose of erythromycin, however, was unclear. In a subsequent study involving 35 ICU patients, GE was measured using a breath test technique, before and after 2 different doses of erythromycin or placebo and a &#8216;low&#8217; intravenous dose (70mg) of erythromycin appeared to be as effective as a &#8216;moderate&#8217; dose (200mg). Both doses were only effective in subjects who had delayed GE at baseline. Based on the outcome of these studies, low doses of erythromycin have subsequently been routinely used to treat feed intolerance in the critically ill patients at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Animal and human studies suggested that the antibiotic, cefazolin, may have a prokinetic effect. Cefazolin, however, did not demonstrate similar prokinetic activity at a &#8216;low&#8217; dose (50mg) in a critically ill cohort. The results of this study do not support the use of this agent, at this dose, as a prokinetic, in this population. If nasogastric administration of nutrition proves unsuccessful an alternative is to infuse nutrient directly into the small intestine. However, the placement of feeding tubes distal to the pylorus is technically difficult. A novel technique for postpyloric tube insertion was examined with promising results. In summary, the studies described in this thesis have provided a number of insights relevant to the management of the critically ill by quantifying the prevalence of feed intolerance and delayed GE, characterising some of the disturbances in gastrointestinal motility underlying this problem, and evaluating a number of therapeutic interventions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">critical illness; gastric emptying; intensive care; prokinetics; nutrition; erythromycin; gastrointestinal motility</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Motility</field><field name="subject">Gastrointestinal system Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Nutrition</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using shell morphology to characterise abalone populations across multiple spatial scales.</field><field name="creator">Saunders, Thor M.</field><field name="description">Many sedentary marine invertebrates have a fine-scale (100s m) population structure that complicates their conservation and management. This is a consequence of the limited information on the boundaries between component populations and the biological variability among them. Blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra) form discrete populations many of which are &#8216;stunted&#8217; with individuals reaching a maximum length less than those in adjacent areas. A range of morphological measurements from samples of stunted and &#8216;non-stunted&#8217; H. rubra collected from sites spread across broad (10s km) and fine (100s m) spatial scales in southern South Australia. In addition, information on the growth, size at maturity and fecundity of H. rubra was obtained from these same sites. The ratio between shell length and shell height showed clear and significant differences among samples from stunted and non-stunted sites. The fine-scale morphometric collections suggested that stunted populations existed at smaller spatial scales compared to those for non-stunted populations. Spatial variation in these key life history parameters could primarily be attributed to differences between stunted and non-stunted sites. Relationships between each of these parameters and the ratio between shell length and shell height were also examined. The spatial patterns in morphology and biology were highly correlated suggesting that shell length:shell height ratio can be used as a simple &#8216;morphometric marker&#8217; to distinguish among populations of abalone and identify their biological characteristics. The detection of differences H. rubra morphology among variable environments cannot determine whether these differences represent a plastic response to the local environment, or whether morphology is genetically fixed. A reciprocal transplant experiment was used to test whether stunted H. rubra are the result of a plastic response to the environment or fixed genetic trait. Furthermore, environmental factors that affect food availability were related to differences in morphology. Morphological plasticity was confirmed as the mechanism causing morphological variation in H. rubra. Individuals transplanted to sites with non-stunted H. rubra grew significantly faster when compared to stunted controls, while individuals transplanted to stunted sites grew significantly slower compared to non-stunted controls. It is suggested that these differences are related to resource availability with areas limited in food supply resulting in stunted populations and areas with abundant food resulting in non-stunted populations. To reduce the risks of over-fishing and localised depletion of H. rubra, management units (MUs) that encompass individual populations need to be determined and then managed according to their life-history characteristics. Potential MUs in the South Australian abalone fishery were identified from the broad-scale, spatial distribution of stunted and non-stunted populations of H. rubra, by applying the morphometric marker to commercial shell samples. Key life-history parameters of the H. rubra populations within the potential MUs were estimated using relationships between this marker and H. rubra biology. Data from fine-scale systematic sampling by commercial fishers were used to validate spatial patterns observed from the more broadly distributed commercial catch samples. The location, distribution and size of potential MUs were largely inconsistent with that of current management. The locations of two MUs were consistent across the broad- and fine-scale datasets with the fine-scale samples being more informative for identifying a potential boundary between these. These results suggest that this morphometric marker can used as a tool for the spatial management of abalone fisheries by simply and inexpensively inferring key biological parameters for individual populations and identify the boundaries among these based on these differences. This approach is among the first to provide a practical means of more closely aligning the scales of assessment and management with biological reality for sedentary marine invertebrates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphology; population structure; fisheries management; biological variation; spatial management; morphometric marker</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/51020</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corpus callosum morphology and function in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the relationship between the corpus callosum and cognitive functioning in healthy adults.</field><field name="creator">Hutchinson, Amanda Dianne</field><field name="description">The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest fiber&#185; tract in the brain and connects homological regions of the two cerebral hemispheres. Research with split-brain patients, whose CC has been surgically severed, and neurologically intact groups has shown that the CC is important for sustained and divided attention. Due to its role in attention, the CC is of interest to clinical conditions in which attention is affected, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although the size of the CC has been examined in children and adolescents with ADHD, the results have been inconsistent. Therefore, the first of three studies in this thesis synthesized the current research in a metaanalysis, which analyzed the data from 13 studies that examined CC area in children and adolescents with ADHD, when compared to healthy controls. This study found that the splenium, the most posterior region of the CC, was smaller in ADHD and the rostral body, an anterior region, was smaller in boys with ADHD compared with controls. Thus, there is evidence for differences in area in both the anterior and posterior regions of the CC in ADHD. It was not known whether these differences persist into adulthood, however, because CC size had not been examined in adults with ADHD. Therefore, the second study examined CC area and structural integrity in young adults with ADHD compared with healthy controls using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), respectively. The difference in the size of the splenium was not present in this adult sample, although the genu (an anterior region of the CC) was smaller and two midposterior regions were larger in adults with ADHD when compared with controls. In addition, a reduction in the integrity of the genu and greater integrity in the splenium was found in ADHD. The relationship between CC morphology and measures of attention and IQ was also examined in young adults with ADHD and controls in order to assess the functional significance of differences in the CC. The integrity of the splenium was correlated with performance on the Stroop task, which requires attentional control. Hence, this study indicated that the morphology of the CC is atypical in young adults with ADHD and that these differences in the CC may impact on cognitive functioning. Interestingly, an estimate of performance IQ was negatively correlated with CC area in controls. This result conflicts with previous research on the relationship between IQ and the CC in healthy adults although the literature has yielded inconsistent findings. The third study, therefore, examined the relationship between IQ and both CC area and integrity in more detail in a larger sample of young adults. A negative correlation was found between the area of posterior regions of the CC and an estimate of performance IQ, while an estimate of verbal IQ was associated with decreased structural integrity in the genu. This study supports the hypothesis that differences in CC size and or integrity may have cognitive consequences. In summary, this thesis confirms the view that the development of the CC is atypical in children and young adults with ADHD. In addition, differences in CC integrity were associated with cognitive functioning in young adults with ADHD. Finally, the morphology of the CC is related to cognitive performance in healthy adults. &#185; American spelling is used throughout the thesis in order to be consistent with the published papers which have been published or prepared using American spelling.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">corpus callosum; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="subject">Corpus callosum.

It prevents the organisms from unnecessary expenditure of energy and enables them to exploit the nutrients in appropriate manner. It represents a complex system of gene regulation. The main aim of this study was to study the intracellular localization of proteins involved in CCR including CreA, CreB, CreC and CreD in A. nidulans in repressing and derepressing conditions. The major regulatory protein involved in CCR in A. nidulans is CreA. It is a DNA-binding repressor, but very little is known about the molecular events that allow CreA function to result in appropriate regulation in response to carbon source. To determine the amount and localization of CreA in different carbon sources, strains were made over-expressing GFP and HA tagged CreA. Western analysis showed that high levels of full length CreA can be present in cells that show normal responses to carbon catabolite repression, whether they are grown in repressing or derepressing media. Hence the amount of CreA is similar in both the conditions and thus degradation of CreA is not a key step in carbon catabolite repression. Fluorescence microscopy studies have shown that CreA is in the nucleus under repressing and derepressing carbon conditions and this is not affected by the absence of CreB or CreD, the other important proteins in A. nidulans. Thus mere localization of CreA in nucleus is not sufficient to cause carbon catabolite repression and there is some modification process involved for CreA to act as a repressor protein in CCR. CreB is a deubiquitinating protein and CreC is a protein containing five WD 40 repeats, a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a proline rich region and both the proteins are present in the cell in a complex. CreB was localized using strains that over-expresses GFP tagged CreB and fluorescence microscopy. CreB is present mainly in the cytoplasm in both repressing and derepressing conditions. Moreover, intracellular localization of CreB is unaffected by the presence or absence of CreD. However, the amount of CreB was higher in a creD+ background as compared to a creD34 mutant background, implying that the presence of CreD affects the amount of CreB in the cell. CreC was localized by using strain that over-expresses YFP tagged CreC and it is also present mainly in the cytoplasm. CreD contains arrestin domains and PY motifs and is highly similar to the Rod1p and Rog3p from S. cerevisiae. CreD is proposed to be involved in ubiquitination process in CCR in A. nidulans. Localization studies have shown that CreD is present throughout the cell in a punctate pattern with more in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. CreB and CreD co-localize in some regions of the cell whereas in other regions either CreB or CreD is present.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CreA; nuclear localization; ubiquitination</field><field name="subject">Aspergillus nidulans Molecular genetics.

By 1988 Australia and New Zealand were the only countries permitting its use, limited to the treatment of refractory angina pectoris conditional upon the therapeutic monitoring of patients, due to recognition of the concentration dependent nature of its efficacy and toxicity. An understanding of the extreme interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of perhexiline due to metabolism by the polymorphic Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has prompted a recent resurgence of its use in Australasia and Europe. Perhexiline is a chiral molecule and is administered as a racemic mixture. Prior to the publication of the papers that are the topic of this thesis the characterisation of the clinical pharmacology of the enantiomers of perhexiline had been limited to one pharmacokinetic study that suggested that the (+) enantiomer of perhexiline may display a smaller polymorphic effect in its metabolism than its optical antipode. The four publications that comprise this thesis describe a comprehensive investigation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the enantiomers of perhexiline in extensive and poor metabolisers (EM and PM, respectively) of CYP2D6 in both an in vitro model and clinically. The aim was to determine if the CYP2D6 polymorphism affects the metabolism of (+)-perhexiline significantly less than (-)-perhexiline, such that the inherent variability observed in the pharmacokinetics of the racemic preparation used clinically might be overcome by administration of only (+)-perhexiline. Although both the in vitro and in vivo studies determined that the involvement of CYP2D6 was proportionately greater in the total clearance of (-)- than (+)-perhexiline, the empirical data also demonstrated that the role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of (+)-perhexiline was simply too pre-eminent for a chiral preparation of this enantiomer to significantly reduce the difference in clearance observed between EM and PM. An unexpected finding was that the enantioselectivity observed in the clinical pharmacokinetics of perhexiline in EM was, in fact, significantly greater in PM. Whilst the enantioselectivity in EM was attributable to metabolism by CYP2D6, the mechanism responsible for this in PM could not be determined, but was postulated to involve enantioselective biliary excretion. Because PM are effectively exposed to greater concentrations of (+)-perhexiline and lower concentrations of (-)-perhexiline, when the relative pharmacodynamic activities of the individual enantiomers have been established therapeutic drug monitoring may be improved by the development of specific enantiomer target concentration ranges in plasma. What is certain is that perhexiline will remain an essential option in the armamentarium for the treatment of refractory angina pectoris and therapeutic drug monitoring will remain obligatory due to the inter- and intra-subject pharmacokinetic variability attributable to the respective polymorphic and saturable metabolism of both enantiomers by CYP2D6.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pharmacokinetics; Perhexiline; stereoselective; CYP2D6</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of climate and cultural practices on grapevine flowering and yield components.</field><field name="creator">McLoughlin, Suzanne Jean</field><field name="description">This thesis presents results from two separate studies. First, the impact of bearer length on yield components within the canopy was investigated in season 2005/06, on a commercially-managed, mechanically-pruned vineyard of Vitis vinifera L. Cabernet Sauvignon in Coonawarra, South Australia. Pruning resulted in the retention of bearers with 1-7 nodes, with the weighted average bearer length being two nodes for the canopy. As bearers of one to five nodes in length were the most common, these were studied. Yield components (on a per shoot basis) were analysed according to the node position on the bearer at which the shoot arose. Both budburst and inflorescence number per node were highest at the distal node positions on each length bearer, even if the nodes were at the same positions from the base of the bearer and would normally be expected to have similar fertility. Budburst appeared to act by modifying inflorescence number per node based on the relative location of each node from the apex of the bearer. Shoots that arose from the most distal node positions had the highest flower number per inflorescence and berry number per bunch. Flower number per inflorescence was significantly higher on two-inflorescence shoots than single-inflorescence shoots. The relationship between bunch size and node position, unlike that between inflorescence number and node position, was dependent on bearer length. The relative size of the inflorescence appeared to be affected more so by the node pOSition at which the shoot occurred on the bearer, as opposed to the actual node position on the shoot at which the inflorescence occurred. There was a positive, non-linear relationship between average fruit yield per bearer and bearer length. Although yield was highest from the bearer with the highest node number (five nodes), there was no significant difference in yield per bearer for the bearers of three to five nodes in length. If average bearer length was increased from two to three nodes, the potential yield gain per bearer is estimated at 38 per cent. The second study presents results of correlations between bunch number and components of bunch weight (flower number and berry number) to investigate co-development of bunch number and bunch size. These data were collected from 4 vineyards in the Limestone Coast Zone of South Australia from Vilis vinifera L. Chardonnay, Shiraz and Cabemet Sauvignon during seasons 2002/03 to 2006/07. The significant correlations found between fertility and both bunch weight and flower number per inflorescence suggest that the same factors that affect bunch number in a particular season will also affect bunch size. When inflorescence primordia were initiated and differentiated under cool conditions, actual bunches per node and flowers per inflorescence were low. Differences in climate between the vineyard sites were found to be minimal and therefore did not strongly affect the magnitude of the yield components at the vineyard sites. Cultural practices at each vineyard site were sufficiently variable to affect fertility levels. Genotype is thought to determine the range of flowers per inflorescence that a variety can potentially carry, whereas actual flower number per inflorescence is thought to be determined by inflorescence primordium initiation and differentiation temperatures, as well as temperatures during budburst. Despite significant correlations between flower number per inflorescence and berry number per bunch, flower number per inflorescence preflowering for Cabemet Sauvignon, Shiraz and Chardonnay is inversely related to actual percentage fruit set. This is possibly a survival mechanism for the grapevine as it allows the vine to maximise yield each season without detriment to its longevity. Bunches per vine accounted for the majority of the seasonal variation in yield per vine. Fluctuations in bunch number per vine (and therefore yield) are likely to be reduced by varying the number of nodes retained per vine according to the relative fruitfulness per node present pre-pruning. This practice is therefore likely to result in the seasonal variation of berries per bunch becoming a stronger driver of yield. The commercial impacts of these studies are two-fold. Data presented will assist growers to understand the reasons for which their pruning regimes are affecting yield production and how these pruning regimes may be modified to achieve a target yield-particularly when growers are faced with seasons of low predicted fertility. In addition, data presented will allow growers to improve their crop forecasting accuracy, with a greater understanding of the link between bunch number and bunch size. In the current situation of oversupply in the wine industry, wineries are adopting a tough stance towards growers over-delivering on their grape contracts. Therefore, any assistance that can be provided to growers on improving accuracy of yield estimates will be beneficial both to the grower and winery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; yield; node position; bearer length; berry number per bunch; flower number per inflorescence; climate</field><field name="subject">Grapes Climatic factors.</field><field name="subject">Crops and climate Australia.</field><field name="subject">Crop yields Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/52440</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating bacterial biofilms in chronic Rhinosinusitis : an in vitro study, in vivo animal study and a examination of biofilms in human CRS.</field><field name="creator">Kien, Ha Rach</field><field name="description">Introduction Bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). This thesis consists of a number of separate studies. The results of each study were designed to help provide an evolution of knowledge that could be applied to our subsequent investigations on the topic of bacterial biofilms and chronic rhinosinusitis. In vitro studies were utilized to document the capacity of CRS bacteria to form biofilms as well as to investigate the efficacy of various antimicrobials at high concentrations. Additionally, an in vivo sheep model was developed to examine different biofilm detection techniques. Finally, a study of CRS patients was conducted to investigate the incidence of biofilm related sinus disease. Methods Our in vitro studies used 96 well crystal violet microtiter plate assays to determine the biofilm growth characteristics of S.aureus isolated from patients with CRS. Established biofilms were then subjected various antimicrobial agents, and the degree of biofilm reduction calculated to examine their potential for sinus biofilm treatment. A sheep sinusitis model involved performing endoscopic sinus surgery, occlusion of frontal sinus ostia and the introduction of bacteria. Mucosal specimens were subsequently examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). CSLM was also used in a prospective study to document the presence bacterial biofilms on the mucosa of patients with CRS compared to controls. Results The findings of in vitro experiments revealed that not all isolates were capable of forming biofilms. Of the antibiotics tested, only Mupirocin was capable of reducing biofilm mass by 90% in all isolates. The animal model showed considerable variation in biofilm detection rates. The CSLM biofilm detection rate was 100% in obstructed sinuses with bacteria introduced, whereas TEM detected only 66%. Both these objective measures failed to identify biofilms in control groups. SEM found biofilms in all experimental groups including controls. CSLM analysis of CRS patients found Bacterial biofilms in 44% and no biofilms in controls. Conclusion The demonstration of biofilms in the sheep model for sinusitis and biofilms on the mucosal specimens of patients with CRS, and the ability of bacteria in CRS to form biofilms in vitro, further supports the hypothesis that biofilms play a role in the pathogenesis of CRS. CSLM is the modality of choice in documenting the presence of bacterial biofilms on sinus mucosal surfaces due to the inherent flaws of sampling error and subjectivity of TEM and SEM. Finally, CRS is a multi-factorial disease, topical Mupirocin via nasal irrigation may be a therapeutic option in patients with likely S.aureus biofilms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic rhinosinusitis; biofilms; CRS; bacterial biofilms;in-vitro; in-vivo</field><field name="subject">sinusitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53215</field></doc></add>
